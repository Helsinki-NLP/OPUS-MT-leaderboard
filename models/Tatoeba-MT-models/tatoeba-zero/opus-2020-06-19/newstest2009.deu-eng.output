The Prayer Börse is struggling against business conclusions in the minute.
After the stealing disappearing, the prayer Börse could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of śEZ reached almost half of the normal day business.
The Prayer Börse was linked at the beginning of the service work at the invasion of the Monday, as it was up to six other percentage points.
This time the reason was for the invasion on the Wall Street.
In Czech also, the market reaction is shown on the results of the vote of the American Representative House, which has refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares at the Börsens in Asia, while the indexs could compare a part of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four percent points during the business period, but later one of the losses could be reduced, and the decline of approximately 2,5% was reduced.
The Index Hun Seng China Enterprises, who observed the movement of Chinese shares at the Burse in Hong Kong, almost 3,8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the Börse in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the loss of 4.3 per cent reduced.
The Börse in Taiwan increased by 3.6 percent after the index.
"The Timing for Saving Action in the United States is insecure and will influence the financial markets in the world," says the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, independence on the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should return as soon as possible to the negotiation table and adopt the draft for support of the financial system as soon as possible.
Otherwise, it was threatened that other countries would also be affected by the invasion.
A bloodbad of American acts
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for support of the financial system to apply up to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion Kč).
The lawyers so ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bushs believes that the plan would regulate the basic causes for the financial crisis and, therefore, help to stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American Acts experienced a bloodbad, and the most important share index marked the largest invasion in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index summarized by almost seven percent, a similar invasion was recently signed in 1987.
The index was already cut before the vote, but there was little signs that the project would not be done in the House of Deputy, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes permission: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have joined themselves in a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be amended at the beginning of the next week.
The American lawyers reached a breakdown in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the American financial system in a range of $700 billion (e.g. 12 billion chronics).
However, this does not mean the victory.
Indeed, the Congress Members must still discuss some details of the Agreement before they publish the conclusion of the law and vote.
The financial system support plan is negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Bank and Financial Service Committee Barney Frank of Agent Reuters said.
The Senate may, according to different information, be the most likely to be voted on the plan in the mid-day afternoon.
The economists should, according to the communication that the plan is adopted, is the first important psychological factor for the reliance of the financial markets.
However, it comes to a "experience" due to the complex mechanisms, as well as to the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a significant progress.
We have explained our different views how a market stabilisation package should look", said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi against the Agent Bloomberg.
In accordance with your words, it could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawyers were together on Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to provide its final form to the Government Fund.
This provides a purchase of unproduced hypothequency by financial companies that threaten financial companies in serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the random of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the use plan, but I think we're at the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly undergoing in the share markets that are strongly declining.
The words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, were striving to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
In this way, investmentrs are intended to be based on the Asian financial markets that are in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect the business on Monday.
However, it is not quite clear when both rooms of the American Congress are voted on the law, even if the negotiations are not yet able to deal with a problem in the last minute.
The lawyers hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will learn some changes.
The total amount for the system should be shared in two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be prepared as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress may block the expenditure of the rest of the money when he has the impression that the programme does not meet its function, but more than $100 billion, and then the final $350 billion.
Bush valued progress in negotiations positive
The President has a veto right in this decision, but the Congress may agree on its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic gratitude of the programme has remained based on the financing for the purchase of bad hypothetical values, whose value has been made, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to return their hypotheses.
"We've done everything.
The Representative House should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," says the Republicn Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush has also shown satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress on Saturday and "true the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden fall schedules
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senates Christopher Dodd, the Legal Understander, agreed that the lawyers would be responsible for the currency programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the end of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden schedules for corporate directors, which are involved in the programme, and sets up a committee to monitor the funds.
This will lead to the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved a great progress in direction of a agreement which works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates a support for householders who have problems with the repayment of their hypotheks.
The government should deal with new rates with hypotheses which it purchases, with the objective of raising the monthly costs for the debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea after Patria Finance David Marek's main economy, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanisms and what prices the problemtic active will be purchased.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government share the losses between each other," said Marek to the server iHNeed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or starting next week, Marek's view is not expressed.
"By more important is that the Congress members have some to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that it comes to an approval is at this moment the most important", emphasized Marek.
Double on messer's snake: MP3 player against phones.
We have consulted you at your choice
While almost every MP3 file can play, MP3 player can not be phoned.
That's why it seems like it's better to buy just a phone.
Despite all, there are sufficient reasons why you should have a own player.
The choice depends totally on the type of use and claims to the future owners.
Seriously, you are hard to purchase for home a pretty bunch of plate players to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news appears not on LPs, and from quality view there is no objective reason for it.
However, you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in Regal, you probably dream at least one of this.
So it is also with the music on travel, so with compressed music, simplified - music in the MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For one, it may not be acceptable to give eight thousand krones to a player, but also a pink-floyd-floyd-fan is likely to have serious head hearers for twenty-twenty chrones from the market.
Two extras between which it is sufficient for each room.
The selection has been broken.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do, they don't even make an extraordinary way.
No modern device is to use as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the simulation, it can return music and videos, both take up, it has a better, once more bad photo device and may also be navigated.
And if you're still involved with the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in the tap.
It's a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grip and no TV photo.
However, the university of the phones also brings parts with themselves.
If you use more functions on your phone, the more often you will have to load it.
And the playing of music is one of the largest energy frauds.
Only few phones can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, but it's much less.
In this regard Music Player (specially the simplest) are clearly more efficient.
Therefore, you should recognise that they can not play more than a few hours of music.
If you depart and call up, you will like to buy a loading device for the office - that is also applicable to twitter devices.
When MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less goods keep at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time.
There is another problem when you want to overcome the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices is available via a USB close, and any phone can not be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can switch the music directly to a memory media, but only few card read devices will be completed without reducing with the changing memory cards that are used in phones.
With players, you don't need any special software to exemption (iPod).
You need the device only to eat via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves set up a music library, ordered according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the gene or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices are only the tree structure of the address directory, such as the Windows Explorer, some can both (reverse, Samening, Sony, Cown, intelligent phones with the operational system).
Players are easier to use, phones can be more
In the selection of a concrete device, you should be expertised in particular after the lifetime of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of the ring, and of course also the drive comfort.
It's music especially for you and hear you every day only in the road trail, then it's a favorite phone that plays MP3 files.
What's really possible for almost every phone.
You don't have to control otherwise what music formats can be processed by a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be in this format.
The format belongs to the most distributed, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Actually, AAC (use a format, the apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the buying of music online.
Only mobile Internet is required to call the relevant pages of a supplier (or another provider), and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be an enormous argument for why you should have a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offering of the suppliers is bad and only limits radio.
The prices are not the lower.
However, it is generally understood that this type of sale of music will be controlled in future by the music industry.
The phone is most of them.
If you have fun to listen to something, take the phone after the phone in the jacket, while the player is forgotten to be home.
However, it comes to the fact that you are always listening to the head or at least a free-speaking institute.
If not, you can turn back to the integrated sound speaker, almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handys will be in price for many.
The most acceptable costs normally are less than 3000 chrones.
For three and four thousand chrones you've already obtained a totally responsible Walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal head hearers are there.
The best and technically extracted phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headache costs up to fifty thousand chrones.
The advantage of the player is back in light service.
The most simple - and not quite appropriate (see Selection) - Player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar to the use of the previous normal cassette rear or for example the plate player.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an irrelevant mobile Internet and then a horrible account for data transmissions.
After which device you should take now
The most suitable phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are also available on a slot for exchangeable memory media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand chrones are expensive.
But look at it.
The base deals are generally supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most money can also read 8-GB player cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a precious MP3 player, then go to Cown, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irver.
If after capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to place more than 1100 crons on the table.
Listen to the most powerful ears, take the favorite specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have own MP3 drivers, and the service comfort comes to the individual MP3 players.
On the other hand, Sony Ericsson is here, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user device as the individual sold MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crons, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life period (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) offer MP3 manufacturers of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already returning to Czech in this year.
Maybe.
The Mobilfunk market in Czech is rightly equipped, which provides practically all the services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that imposes the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this will not be waiting for a long time.
That the Czech Mobile Canadians work to the most costs in Europe, we have already reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the Telecommunication Authority, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher than the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of the roaming costs, it is likely to be a paradoxe situation - for some customers of the Czech Mobile Canadians will be more easier than to be home.
How does the prices in Czech in comparison with Europe be so high?
The answer is simple, it lacks competitiveness that really makes a fight.
Maybe it seems paradox, there are three mobile networks in Czech and a penetration of far more than 100%.
However, there is much competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of Czech Republic of Telecommunications (thu) Pavel Dvośák, who has often expressed it in the past that there is no place for another provider in Czechia.
It is likely to be true that a classic provider with a own network does not have many other chances (for example, he would probably find too little frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In addition to the accession of virtual suppliers to the mobile market, there was a significant price ratio to which the classic mobile channels had to react.
There were still similar voices before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as in Czech.
However, it has shown that there is a place for such suppliers and that they can really be successful.
Nevertheless, you need to find long-term examples.
In February this we reported about the start of the virtual offerer Mobilking in Poland.
In only a half year, this provider was able to win more than 100 thousand customers and to get up for the fifth largest providers of the country.
Hinter Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which is in Czech, among other U:fons.
The benefit of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to operate effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers are normally profiled as low-cost companies - they offer bill telephone conversations and SMS, which often is accompanied by a less larger service offer.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in British SMS offers at least half more than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it may also be a right shock to place on a non-clicked target group.
Indeed, this provider is specifically directed to men.
"Real Man chooses Mobilking - the supplier who loves them and can trust them", says David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual supplier.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could also be covered in Czech.
In addition, the president of Vodafone Miroslave śepickī doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market session on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively covered from the view of the service offer."
In Czech unfortunately, the mobile channels believe
However, it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile channel provider Czech will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in Czech the negotiations are not otherwise hopeful.
It will go to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studničkova, a preacher of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly she confirmed that the current mobile channels in Czech have not been otherwise attached to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to make no potential competition.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile channel has already shown the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to become a real competitor of telefónica O2 in the field of company.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And before, it's better.
On this option we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czechic Mobile Canadians.
With some of them, we were already able to reach negotiate struggles", says the publisher of the Pavel Kadl Group.
Maybe there are better times now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
But until then this is turned by an unwindable wall of the swimming.
"In this moment we do not realize that there is a full virtual provider in Czech place.
The twenty-food market is a large specification for other markets.
Until then, there was no subject to us with a complex and serial project in this area", says the Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sscheś from the Press Department of Telefonic O2.
The specification of the Czech market also indicates other providers.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrova presser adds rarly to the Declaration of O2: "After we have not found a viable and mutual project that can continue to build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will not go to a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we should have presented a concrete offer to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone highlights its attention to the compliance of the requirements of the own 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī believes: "The negotiations with potential virtual providers are open, especially in the area of the participation of costs and infrastructure.
This is what we look at from the view of the customers than the best.
The main strategy of Vodafons in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers in hand
The step of the mobile channels is easy to understand, another provider called more competitiveness, which would be decreasing prices and also lead to a decline of winning.
Why should such a competitor simplify the market entry?
That the providers can go to a squad when it is about something, the long hint and hers are also involved in the development of U:fon.
The most strongest pressure in direction śTU went to time when U:Fon on the market, from the T-Mobile Society.
This also provides the public information available from the websites of the  zuivel web sites.
Now, however, just U:fon is a argument why you should not allow a virtual offerer.
Martina Kemrova noted: "The competitive area of the Mobilfunk market was recently strengthened by marketing access to a fourth mobile channel.
In view of the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor on the market itself and in particular its services would provide high requirements."
In view of this point of view, however, the absolute detriment of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprised.
This is not only the position of the sweet Tsu, which, in the Czech Republic, is different from Britain and other high-speaked countries, has no competence to enter economic competition.
This is solely the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this concerned the whole problem in its entire typical situation.
"The market involvement of a virtual mobile channel would then be possible after it has arrived to a contract between a mobile channel and a virtual provider on the introduction of the necessary infrastructure.
Not until this contract was concluded, since the offer was probably not sufficiently interested for the classic providers,” said in response to our request by Christián Chalupa from the UOHS for Foreign Relations.
Such formulation would not be surprised by representatives of the supplier.
A authority representing consumer interests and, inter alia, should consider that no one misuse its position on the market is more than careful.
In particular, when Christián Chalupa adds: "The island where virtual providers work totally normally, it is to be observed that their market access has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely to be the pressure on the correct functioning of the market, and a price reduction is not to the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking to the almost shocking context of the three mobile channels that result from their reactions.
The question whether it really is about a accident is on the hand.
Just as the absolute same benzine price at the tank devices is only a accident and the consequences of a hard competition campaign.
"The Authority has not found any signs in this matter which indicates a trade directed towards competition, and therefore has no reason to enter any kind of matter.
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, therefore, he has no increased responsibility for its market trade.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile market for virtual suppliers probably have not also been the telecommunication regulatory authority", Chalupa stated in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many strict points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the tv, which is a single market in view of economic competition.
At that market, of course, no one of the Czech Mobile Canadians has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, provide a different vision - for the marketing of a virtual provider is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile channel has - logically - the monopol for its network.
This means that it takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not contact this argument, it should be an advertising to the UOHS at least that three mobile channels are similar.
The complaints of a number of interested persons (including the GTS Novera company) show that they are subject to very similar obstacles in negotiations with all offerers.
The derogation of the responsibility to the âTU is then a legal trick in telecommunication services which is distant from the whole matter.
This was to be observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement the recently adopted newspapers of the Telecommunication Act the expansion of the competence of the TSI in the field of economic competition in telecommunication, although a number of experts had promised that the situation was improved.
This must only be aware of the representatives of the UOHS, but they probably have other broad interests.
It's okay if no one looks.
Uncertainly, the functioning of any pseudovirtual providers remains the same in the Czech mobile networks.
It is the company that provides own price lists for mobile telecommunication services, but only public.
Normally, it is a multi-level marketing company.
Mobile mobile services are offered for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others.
The price lists of these companies are normally selected only.
The wiseness of the matter is that the company involves towards the operator as a classic company that orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czechic mobile operators prohibit a similar type of sale.
"If the cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will be employed, what can lead to an end of cooperation with the society concerned," Martina Kemrova answered our question to this problem.
However, it is inevitable that there is nothing to do with the responsibilities of the mobile channels.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a action.
Indeed, from the activities of these companies, they are not to be disappointed by the winnings, and at the same time, they - in the difference with the real virtual offerers - are not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav śepickī notes: "The law allows such types of speculations, however, the services of these companies will only be used by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that SIM cards do not run on their phone, so they can't have completely as normal clients of the mobile channel."
Only this should happen at least strangely.
Furthermore, there is another question for the UOHS.
Close the mobile channels before such action, why do they hear against a virtual supplier?
It should be added that the UOHS has strong competences in order to detect such activities, and if it does not want, it must not be satisfied with the declaration of the suppliers, they would know nothing about it and their business conditions.
When Czech Republic isn't the most precious
As stated in the text several times, the market access of virtual providers had a significant decline in the various services.
There are practical practices in all countries where virtual providers have occurred, the classic providers are trying to prevent their decline almost more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small market, or very sweet market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the high-developed countries, however, in these times, the regulatory bodies were introduced which did not have the interests of mobile channels, but the interests of their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual employee had occurred, and further.
Unfortunately, the Czechan regulatory bodies are in the whole case as a warm cartoffel.
From our experiences, we cannot conclude that in clarity in the skills in these cases is more than good.
But we don't get the fleet into the corn.
If the background information is agreed, and soon a virtual provider is present, the Czechic Mobilfunk market may soon be moved again.
If a offerer allows the development of a virtual mobile channel, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it is to dismiss any other interests (discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally not call more tors than the rest of Europe.
The new Czechic Hymne has four new versions.
Search the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Symphony.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Miek Topolánek presented the new accommodations of the National Hymne Where is my homeland on the day of the Czech State.
The Hymne was newly played by the National Theatre Orchester under the leadership of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions available - with men or women's solvent, in chorization and in an instrumental version.
The opinion of Kateśina Knśinkova and Adam Plachetka.
The workers of the Hymne versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNeed.cz server, you can just listen to all four versions.
For Bślohlavek, the Czech National song is one of the most beautiful hymnes.
Previously, he had said to the Czech Rundfunk that he had chosen for the Solo-Varian songers with young, representative voices that are marked and favorite.
"After the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with the Chor so that you understand the text well, so that it depends on an agreement," says the Declaration.
The Czech National Symphony next year takes its 175th Jubilee.
The song Kde domovj started the first time in 1834 on the beach of the Stindetheater in the originally tschechical piece of Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music standed in František šcroup.
It was popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first throne of the song then became a organic part of the national sympathy after the development of the Czechoslowakei in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols also remained after the development of the own Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
Prayer transports first on a chip at midnight
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the history of the Prager transport companies will be a date in which the first train passengers will enter into a U-board, road trains or bus, which take an electronic coup on the table instead of a paper vehicle.
These can now be purchased for about hundreds of thousands of people who have the Chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or a year-day cop (validly from 1 January 2009) and allow them to play on their chip cards, such as in the information centers and furnitures of traffic stations at the U-Down stations Museum, Mśstek, Nádraиí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letōany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available through the Internet on the pages of transport companies www.dpp.cz since last night.
The service was taken into charge until afternoon of over 40 customers.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the expenditure window in the U-Bahn stations where they have to wait for a long time periodically on their paper vehicles.
You buy the coupon via Internet, playing this on the open card in one of the thirty branches of the city library.
"In these places the traveller is also available to a switch with a decent staff, the interests in the internet sale and also play the coupon on the card," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
Besides the libraries, e-coupons can also play on open cards that are installed in some U-Bahn seats.
How do these cars appear?
They are red, remembering travellers, the passengers may have already noticed in the Roztyly Stations, Budōjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Actually there are five of the city, until the end of the year should be eighth," adds Opatrný.
The Coupon controls an automate instead of the driver
The use of cars that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just need to enter the chip card, and the coupe that has previously purchased is played by yourself.
The electronic coupons apply not only in the capital city, but also in the area from tomorrow.
For example, in the cities and on the bus lines, the numbers 300 to 499, with the main populations from the Mediterranean communities.
"In the trains that belong to the prayer's integrated transport, the adjunct reader devices, with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zones", says Philip Drapal of the Ropid Organization. This organization combines the driving plans for the prayer transport.
The first city bus has card reading devices on the box at the driver.
The chip card is not only shown by the driver, but the open card is set to a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"When a passenger checks the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than requesting the driver to ask these information," says Drapal.
A guest who does not run with front-stad bus and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons ends, can go back to self-administration automobiles where the coupons are played on the card.
Here you will show the information about the validity of its documents on the device display.
The Sudans requested a human decision from the United States
In 1945, the Southern Germans were invited to join the Bowmeerwalk to the United States.
This refers to a letter which is presented in the collections of the South Bohemic Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the shirm government of the United States of America.
With such desires, some groups of Southern Germany should have been used to the Presidents of the United States in 1945.
This is, among others, from a letter that has been received in a private archive, which is saved today in the collections of the South Bohemic Science Library.
The Germans of Krumau requested the American Presidents in the letter, to return the "South Gaus", which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich Agreement, not allowed the Czechoslowakei.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units are not as a subpressor and enemy in German territories, but as freezer," says in a letter signed with the words "Mans who are on the side of the Southeastern."
Since the connection to the Czechslovakia, the Southern Germans - in recognition of the Czech National Characters - allows them to expect brutality, repercussion, incomprehensiveness, underpression and slavery, request the Presidents of the United States to take the protection rule for today and forever.
"We can't believe you're not going to talk to a four-million people of this area for us for a foreign State to press the minorities and to eliminate and pursue nothing to win the allied," is reading in the letter.
The reason for the reason why the prosecutors are not able to sign, it may be the fear of the "Tchechian subpressors".
If the President of the United States doubts about the sense of the Bohmerwalddeen, it is sufficient if he would initiate a public decision on whether the people would be part of the United States or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter today in knowledge of the sequence stories may be something native, it is noted that some periodic instruments are a good image regarding the expectations of the Southern Germans.
Even if the Boomeans had to accept at least that they would be negotiated on their departure from the Republic, only few of them had a real possibility.
Some waited that the United States and the United States would deal with an autonomy for the Sudan.
Others thought they could just stay in the Czechslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was in the war as a budging German at the sea at the East Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British prison and brought him into a war prisoner to Holstein, twelve other Both Germans came to him to give them a twelve.
"He believed, if they were home, they would pass the Czechese," said Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in the tchechoslovakia has estimated that it would be taken from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotive campaign leads to drivers
First action to security on the streets in the Czech history.
In this way, the emotional media campaign was also characterized that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on midnight.
The Authority of Ministers Alleš śebæek is intended to defeat drivers of dangerous behavior behind the lenkrade.
The campaign for 150 million crons is going on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on fleet.
She's going to take the driver of too fast driving and alcohol on the tax.
And they also remembered that they were swallowed before the shipment.
The campaign wants to speak, especially young drivers, motor vehicles, footballers, and not lastly, with awareness of professional power drivers.
And what's shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who call to emotions.
This also produces the "blue" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "not even" are situated on a character shift.
And in a blood pack, the word "pay".
This means that you can pay an uncertainty moment with your own life.
The spots will be shocked by the observers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspiring similar campaigns in the nearby countries where normal images can be seen with drastic invasions of accidents.
It is promising that the accidents and the number of transport stations are cut into the Czech roads.
The spots were collected by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sweet broth and peitsche for drivers
"For the drivers, the moto of sugar brot and peitsche applies.
Sugar brot means that when they go to red, for example, they run time.
The Peitsche then is the androration of a punishment or a accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the hospital psychologist Na Homolce Martin Kośán.
And therefore, information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative advertising, means the psychologist.
Incredibly less effective are his views on tables that make the drivers arising at a risk.
"If you have a static table that warns before a danger, it will probably be shocked with the environment soon, and the drivers will not take them anymore," says Kośán.
Olmert would return almost all the areas in the exchange of peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed itself for the practical return of all areas situated in 1967, including Jordan, Ostjerusalem and Golan, when they can be closed to the exchange of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
This he stressed in an interview printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all areas (employed) if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to delay the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israel regions) because it will not be given peace without this," he added.
He found that a possible return will also include ostjerusalem.
"Those who want the security in Jerusalem and especially don't want to roll tractors or Bulldozers over his legs, as has happened one of my best friends, will be rejected at one of Jerusalem's part," observed Olmert in reply on two attacks in the city in July, where several people killed and twenty people were blessed.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and the holy and historical places" situated on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to receive the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must be integrated by 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he confirmed.
Absorption from the Golan Heads
Olmert said for a disappearing Israel from the Golans, what is his view of an unbelievable condition to the end of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal does not call to close only with Syria on the basis of a disappearance from the Golan Heaven of Peace with the only way", he reaffirmed Olmert.
"The Syrians only know to know what they need to refuse to return to the Golan Golans.
They will have to reject their current relationship with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with (sitial) Hibollah movement; they shall reject the continuing support that they give to the terrorism of the (sitial) Hamas movement, the terrorism network Al-Khaida and the Zshihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," concretely the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Is Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know that, in a television bus, the movement has not been permitted
With regard to the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travelers should be moved to the bus during the journey.
"If we would strictly and formally observe the law, the activity of a Steward is opposed to the law on road traffic," says the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which came around a twenty-year-old Stewardes' life last week, probably was caused by the LKW's driver who crossed the road.
The young woman stood in this moment at all unfortunately next to the driver at the least safeest place in the car, even though she had available two other places.
However, a bus may also have an accident in the moment or smell in which the steward coffee or newspapers are employed.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped to the car letter after it is also equipped with steel places.
If this is not prescribed in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The television bus of Student Agency has no shoes; what confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, against the current.cz.
"We talked about this with the Ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travelers.
Later, you have taken this, and we have reached a consensus, where the travelers may go to the toilet when they have their seat place," he shared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"No clear legal interpretation for the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibited to provide services to the carrier.
The law on road traffic is only the term of vehicle adherents; however, it does not define their rights and obligations," stated the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly.
However, the Director of the Road Transport Department Josef Pokorný believes that the law is closely covered by this matter.
"It is the case if the bus has a steel place in the product authorisation.
Then it's all," he stressed.
Buses are divided into a city bus where there are seats and the maximum speed is limited, transportation bus with steel loans and higher speed and television bus without shields with the highest permitted speed and seats that are equipped with safeguards.
As in the flight, the Fachman says
The BESIP Factor for Transport Safety Jaroslav Hośín does not consider a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on the board of a bus.
"The situation is comparable to the service of an aircraft is not threatened by many risks in the flight.
Also here is not sure when the turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can shoot the head."
"Bus for a bus, then, of course, also applys the laws of the physical.
Like in the city bus or in a road trail.
The security of Stewards must be cleared by internal rules, and it also believes that this matter is not completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to stretch the services
Student Agency offers a single bus service of Stewards.
The company is employed by about two hundred people in this function.
The Director also does not consider its profession after the accident as a risk.
"But when I get the impression that Steward's professional is riskable, I'm gonna struggle him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travelers.
That would also take the costs," he said.
As a matter of security, Asiana Alexej Litvin's director founds the lack of Stewards in his bus. His company is only a brown of lines compared to the student Agency.
"We don't have stones, but we're swearing from the beginning.
Before or later, this ends with some mortal accident," he had not expressed a year ago for tiden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Neapel, a young stewards from the Pilsen region was unfortunate that had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was likely to be able to cut off the slopes and cut the bus off.
The driver of the bus tried to evacuate a huge maneuver, but collided with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura will be sold.
"They places can't be booked at TV connections, they're blocked."
Signature wants to report LKW-phare.
The Agency is not waiting for the court, but is expected to be a financial punishment for the family of young women.
An amendment of law?
Not in view
An accurate arrangement of the movement of Stewards on a bus could bring a legal arrangement where a thirty-fifth expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already been working over one year.
"But however, this has not been achieved to a concrete conclusion.
The bus is not uncertainly on the agenda order, above all the point system, maximum speed on the car train and the use of phones at the drive," says Fachmann Hośín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards as a threat to the safety of travelers", says Hanzelka, where the control of the safety of the bus is in the competence of the police and labour protection authorities.
Dusseldorfer hopes quiet on Frankfurt
In large words, it does not miss the home workers in the letter of WestLB.
With a combination of units of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, the Central Capital Market House of Spain's Financial Group can be found in the letters known at Monday.
The WestLB took a "component block" with sustainable income power in a such business.
And of course, such a link could be the crucial impact on further crimes in the country bank sector.
So it will be read if a responsibility in difficult time is to demonstrate activity.
Because the WestLB struck stands like before under a powerful pressure.
Not only from the Commission, but also by the Federal Office for Financial Services Monitoring, which the Northern Western and Western Government had recently been clear, the time is to find a future solution.
From a kind of common link between the Deka bank, the Sparca experts know for their investment funds, and the WestLB has already been talking - even on the Frankfurt page.
Even though Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has known at the posting of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a fusion of the house at Mainer Land Street with a country bank, about Helaba or WestLB, he does not see a meaning.
However, the Governing Council of Deka, which was carried to half the country banks and the Sparcase Associations, has taken the position to conduct meetings with WestLB on common business activities.
In this way, it could take part in the capital market or parts of it.
The discussions have been free, so it is in the financial place, just started.
The Deka bank, which is with its 3000 employees to the most important employees in the Frankfurt financial place, is not the first time the talk when it goes to consolidation in the Sparcase sector.
2003 was a moment so long as the Deka bank could fusion with the Rhinland-Pfalz Landbank and the Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this third bond.
Many of the plans were public, the Hess country government said to participate in Helaba's participation.
And the other two houses did not find each other.
The Countrybank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But it has always been thinking about a connection of the Deka bank with country banks.
Last, however, Sunther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba, had spoken against planning games on a meeting with his house.
However, independence of this, it seems to be realized that a comparison of the various households of the public and legal sector is not possible.
Once the landmark is over in Bayern, the BayernLB's first connection could be closed to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, this isn't a good news.
If the pressure increases further fusions, you go after and after the partners.
In the south, she would be more than Junior partners, although she has made the financial crisis a lot better than the households in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with the West LB has reiterated the Hessen-Spain and Girverband showings that participated with 85% in the Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The North LB remained.
Such geostrategic discussions are only one of the sides.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models are adapted to each other.
In June, Merl expressed the crucial question of which business model is to ensure the future of the country banks is not answered by the German Spain and Girls Group.
At the end, the West LB could also be a delusion, but it is not self-deseared.
Thus, in the letter of the board there, it is also said that, at any time, it will be aimed for a "general solution" for the house.
As it allows to bring the composition of individual units with the deca bank under a hair, it will still be shown.
The second Wednesday is known as "Italy Wednesday"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is like his girlfriend with it, and it's all different, he says.
Interesting to them, at the five-letter bus phase of the Marke Kaiser, there is a massively constructed barrier and proves that about 200 October feast travelers, which deep thon can bring his bones.
Elena just gives Luca a shut, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the buspark next to the Puorta Newa Bahnhof, at 23.45 p.m., starts on this evening, "Monaco destination, Birra Festival", at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly preserved to Italians, traveling only to Brazilians.
In one side of the park, the South Americans sing next to their fahns, they have already been celebrated in the night.
And so, Marco watch says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, which has a long mantel with pelzimital feed and a brill with wide silver birds, includes the bus.
Since five years they walk to October, three tours are alone in this year.
Tonight, on the coast, back at 22.30 a.m.
Overnight would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
75 euros cost the driving, the welcome summarry with Caiser-Bier, used to cross the Bayeric cleaning order, the hospital insurance and the German language travel guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And it's already rolling the bus on the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no bird, not yet.
Quickly it's going to sleep in the bus, the travelers.
Well, they'll still need their forces.
Conserved in Brix and in Holzkirch, where other buses also with Italian signs at the 8-hour car train are placed before Munchen a break.
As the Marcos Group finally arrived at half seven hours in the early park area near the Theresien Vise, there are already 50 other bus from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the other are gathering together, Marco holds a recent conversation, explains the attack plan.
First of all, set the yellow cups.
This is linked to "Octoberfest", in fracture, including the Internet address of Marcos Reiseburo: "conoscersiviando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors come to the bicycle, it means walking!", Marco calls into the morning.
"Let!" Run and place the places in the back of the ceiling.
"Don't pass, but we're blocking, and not all the eggs on the same banks, distribute in the room!"
The measure, burns Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinks.
"Secure believers show that we take good care of us!
When you leave the place, they are gone."
Third: "Third of the night, half of us, get back here!", understand?
And it's just going to be the Visn.
In the way, a yellow cover is bound to the trees, to the shielders and even to the selection plate of a large Bayerian people party.
You want to be shocked for the retreat.
It is known as "Italy Wednesdays".
There are no specific information about numbers; the speech is 50 000, which make themselves on the way over the alpines and fall into the bicycles, 10 per cent of all visitors should be attended over this weekend from Italy.
The Muncher police is strengthened by seven Southern Torol police officers, supporting Italian voluntary helpers, the Bayerian Red Cross, which leads to a country statistics, in which Italians before Britain (e.g. 60 income) and Austrian troops (a. 80), with about 200 medical careers.
Specially popular with Italians is the courtyard.
Without bed nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stabil, emphasized by the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbridge only in the last week.
It is good that politicians use the word "relative" and also understood that the German banking sector will not be disrupted from the critical developments.
Because it's happening at the weekend now.
The coins noted in Dax real estate, Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receive a billion credit from the turbulences to the markets, from a consortium German banks.
One person trusted in the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit aid was up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should only take the part that they also take.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background, losses are at the daughter Depfa.
The State financers had reported a periodic report on long-term projects that he had paid, very short-term refinancing - that is not possible because of the misconsciousness of the markets in this respect.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's bar reserve was 95% to 2.537 million euros, and the own capital rate had also shown easy from 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current income and net expenditure from financial enterprises were null to the past period, which contributes from claims to claims and certain value papers, as well as the resolve of refunds in the loan of EUR 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only higher income resulting from refunds from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the refund of interests according to the rules of expenditure and of the business supply for concert companies, the decrease of income of around 16 per cent still had been decreased.
The former state financers had first been settled after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate credits that were then extracted in the Aareal Bank.
Since the classic State financing was too few, the Depfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now take subscriptions that will have a "excellent material effect" on the profit and loss calculation of the group, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the divident was cut off.
Soon for 2007 it was shorted for two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is a significant state and infrastructure financer since the depfa oversight.
It is stronger than other institutions from refinancing on the interbank market, since it has no customer installation.
With the recovery of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit payment is widely reversed among the banks, since the banks accept their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - around 50 billion euro - of the credit portfolio of the depfa short-term funds for refinancing.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing requirements of the group with the credit are covered at a timely time, and the company is "in effect of the current largely functionable international money markets".
From other sources, it is necessary to hear that refinancing has been secured by the money to the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take up the money markets at a timely time.
Federal Bank and the Federal Service Oversight Authority (BaFin) are deeming that Hypo Real Estate Group’s marketability is now safe.
This is hopeful for shareholders and believers of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and inevitableness of the crisis, there is no doubt.
It is not even remarkable that the financing must not be taken in full range.
But also the opposition is not shocked.
After the late Sunday after the department after the bank was still insolvency, at least the savings could not be calmed.
The share rate is around 75% at EUR 3,30.
However, the expenditure currencies are good.
If the priority debts are unlikely moved, the rates of debts are more significant.
In particular, the expenditure of the previous daughter company Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the duration periods of 2009.
Given hypo-real-state loans form a special installation alternative, their value must be considered according to the significant relief of the bankenic crisis and the Institute itself, which had taken the depfa's crisis in the house, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and less-supported business banks are ready to support the system, as long as they can be deleted from a fresh distortion of losses.
Or it is the fact that there is no hope to hope that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the coming 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overcoming the part of the State, the probability of security limits is now only a decisive hope.
This should, especially long-term believers, prepare some unsonable nights with the decision whether they should be divided from their commitments.
A short-term loan can still be used to make a loss statement for the future payment of taxes on currency profits for the years later.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, in the first school day at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to shoot: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she spoke from Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was angry.
Soon before the school journey, I had a bammel.
I live on the border of Tokios in direction Kawasaki and run 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, for luck I didn't lose me.
The beginning of education seems not so strict that at the Tachibana, as we are at home in Niedersachsen.
The students take up from eight hours until twenty to nine a short conversation round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching began, I was on the row to show me.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak before people, not before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school unit yet, I got a old rock of my guest mother, blue, blue shoes, and black shoes.
So I put me in front of the pult and tried to say all right: 'Sayonara Wo Wo she Sylvana...' - I call Sylvana, come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started a good two years ago to learn the language.
The 31 girls in the class have all tasted, shocked, woned, and lately heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that out of my manga.
It belongs to the surviving japanese word chatz and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I'm fast shooted on my place.
The girl, next to me, was very wide, she found it a honour that the winners should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quiet, but when the Gong slaughtered, I was regularly shocked.
Everyone talked through each other and asked me the slaughter in the bowl - it's really difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, all of them packed their bands.
My guest mother had made me a lunchbox, that's just something else than the German pausen breasts.
I had travel with grains, small beaches, salt from gucken and algebra, fruit and a kind of meat in the toilet.
Of course, I don't have a smell of what I'm going to eat in Japan.
It looks strange and smells completely new.
The Fest is that everything's really nice.
Well, maybe to the salzy plants, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just breakfast in Japanese schools.
Sometimes, a girl gives a child's own prepared bento, which then specially produces - in the hope of learning the boys closer to the pausensnack.
That's why I read in my manga comics.
I'm so funny if I can see this here too.
'Why Japan' asked me my friends when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Why it's fascinating me now."
Finally, I'm reading the most favorite Mangas for years.
And so I understand better the comics and the culture there, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So for me it was very clear that I had to travel here forever.
Because I have also a facility for tradition, then and sweet.
And there's a great value here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditionally.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not even lost my feeling here, even though Tokyo is the greatest city I've seen."
Rattes also have feelings
Should a rat or sheep fly at risk mean that they also have fear?
The scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check whether they feel the same if they are similar to us?
The Internet Journal "Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the answers selected in a series of answers to the question "What do you keep true without proof"?
I believe that animals have infringements and other consciousness, without that I or any other one could prove this until now where we can't even prove that others have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brain present the same basic configuration.
However, when we use other species and approve questions of the recognition or generally of the consciousness, we have an instant outcome because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat device is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, fly or crushed.
People are similar to what some scientists close to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to bring our subjective experience to the animals.
To a closure of almost always with human consciousness the seed prefrontal cortex (for its participation in the short-term memory and the executive/control functions).
This wide region is much higher for humans than for the rest of the primates and seems to have a lack of fairness with other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that differ from the prefrontal Courtx, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason for accepting that people even differ from the other primates.
Another dramatic ownership should be in the language of human nature: since such a large part of his life is associated with language, it often means that the consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we can exclude animals.
However, although consciousness does not differ from language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal conscience, as may be created, is probably very different from the majority of our conscious situations.
Therefore, it is difficult to figure out how consciousness can appear in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, nor, nor, because of the special hardware, let us analyze our own experience, it makes us his research for great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of the consciousness that should be scientifically simpler access.
You can investigate the consciousness process of animals without consideration of their contents, and exactly it happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach to Christof Coch and Francis Crick, the neural corelate of consciousness is more likely to be identical or even not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal court for the condition of visualization.
What is the result of refunds now?
I call them back that a emotional system, such as fear in one of his own activity, will be activated.
Thus, what we call "terror" is the mental condition where we find when the activity of the discharge systems localized in the brain (or their consequences, such as physical reactions).
In this way, taxes are closely linked to the regions of the Court of Justice, which represent the primates and in particular the people.
Connection with the speaking nature gives us slight absents of the appearance, because we can distinguish and catalogue with the words and the grammatic conditions, in order to write them to the other side of us.
For example, Antonio Damasio says that infringements from primitive activities in the body feelings regions of the Courtx and the brain of Jaak Pankseep, which, however, are more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not been very changed through human evolution, it could be involved in cross-border refunds.
I can't oppose clean theoretically, however, it is unproofable.
Pankseep argues what appears in Rats and people like fear, probably feels likewise in both cases: but how can you check whether Rats and people accept the same way when they act similarly?
Does a sheep fly in danger or is it fearful?
In my eyes, simply conductiveness can not be evidenced of the equality of life.
Even though the neural comparison continues: rats and people have similar brains, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain's heading responsible for admissions?
And even if you could prove that for people, how would you prove it to be shown by rabbits?
I believe that rats and other skins, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have infringements.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their recognition may be fundamentally different from our (the human consciousness is based on special crystals and languages), I would like to study the emotional behavior than the emotional income of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level will be achieved, if there is no equality in rabbits and people.
As I do not investigate languages and consciousness at Rattes, I don't know whether they exist.
You can keep this for short-term, but I prefer to go forward than to walk on a wall constantly.
I'm also a practical emotive list.
Uefa-President Platini: Frist for Gnaden for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Watjunik said that the preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to register EM together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But this is no amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in two countries."
In the timeplan for the construction or reconstruction of the stations, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests are back.
It may even be reduced by the number of EM stadiums from eight to six.
"We can't spend time anymore.
We must now work with maximum speed," said the Ukrainian President Grigori Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep us constantly."
A further radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandales by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was joined on request by Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It is best "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Poland news Agency PAP.
"We have assured the President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation of Uefa will not be suffered under the EM 2012."
several initialists were sentenced alone in the past season because of manipulation for a decrease, finally even the ligastart had to be moved shortly.

Prices for airport tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, refugees and overnights in Europe were more than the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even more than 50 per cent of the current study.
Flights and overnights in hotels have become more favorable - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and identified a significant fall in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices in the hotel market have been increased for years, the overnights have already been made in many places.
From January to March the prices in the European towns, in 41 from 48, have still been investigated averagely 6,9% compared to 2007.
From April to June the prices were lower than in the previous year.
The most clearest trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers 30 to 37 per cent had to pay less than one year before.
As a reason for this, American Express is seeing the weak dollar course leading to a "decreasing american tourists".
Also, financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are increasingly affected by the decline of the hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cole or Stavanger.
In the Northern city, the hotel prices have an increase of 26.3 per cent even the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed the following:
Because of the inversation of the caros, travelers had to pay more than 7.1% in the slow-scale of Economy than 2007, the intensive long-term flights were even 29.2% torlers.
From April to June the prices for the Economy Class to average 12,5% in comparison to the previous quarter, however, price changes were significantly lower.
In Germany the prices are still more than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices increased at 11,9%, in the second quarter they increased to 23.6%.
According to the study, the prices have even been half of the German internal flights.
The reason for price indent is, on the one hand, the following economic growth, explains the company.
The demand is broken in many segments of the flight market.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes the aircraft between the United States and Europe, is an increased pressure of competition.
Signs of the encouraging situation are the strike of unfavourable trails in airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had been reported in the first half of 2008 Conkurs – only in Europe were these 24 airlines.

Dark Materie affects the flight of spaces
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research for lack of rats: Dark Materie affects the speed of spaces during the so-called Swing-by-handler.
Experts are afraid that the general relationship theory Albert Einstein could not be very right.
Soon 18 years ago, the "Ulysses" space passed through the world space.
Because soon cold fuel drivers are threatened to the kitchen mortality.
A mysterious phenomenon for confusion has been provided by scientists for years - the Swing-by anonymity.
The Swing-by is a flightman from spaces where it receives additional degree in the gravity field of a heavenly body, around the earth.
This allows the samples to save a lot of carriage.
The European American Research Center Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sunson Ulysses.
However, the researchers have been surprised for years. The aircraft is not 100 percent like it would be expected after the old gravity law.
Moreover, it comes to irregularities in the speed.
The sonders will be unexpectedly faster or slower.
The physicians could not explain this effect.
They made him a Swing-by anonymity.
Some experts fear that even the general proportional theory Albert Einsteins, which describes the proportional power of material through a struggle of the room, could not be completely correct.
The American Physician Stephen Adler from the University for Advanced Study from Princeton believes that Einstein did not ruin, and tries to explain the Swing-by anonymity using the so-called dark materials that the astronomers have found in the universe.
"It could be able to be dark material that could also be near the earth."
From the existence of the dark materials, the world space researchers have known only for about ten years.
It is obviously a relationship power that allows the effects of other heavenly bodies to observe.
However, it is completely invisible, which means she sends and reflects no electronic magnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark material, however, is a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.

A court was reported for a year-year-old abuse by her grandparent.
Michael Trerise, 57 from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison punishment of six years after he had established eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he had his headquarter Stephanie Randle regularly feeded as she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in an understanding: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle was in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, in age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had cast her, and her eyes were connected before he carried out sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a guest place.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and went back to Cornwall.
His finger went after Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of his time in honor for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that she had been added two times in the week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who was a frozen surfer and rail driver, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and "he had given life"
In April 2007, her true father Terrance Randle found her death in their apartment in Plymouth.

"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are a extreme feticist and for their sacrifice must have been horrible, especially since she was only seven.
This unfortunate story ends with the victim's self-domicide.
It's worse that it's very uncertain that the case would be noted before the court if it hadn't done this."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, she had her act over the years on her daughter.
However, she would be clearly a many promised, successful and happy young woman."
A person responsible for lost data shall be accused
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official who lost strictly confidence documentation in June will be sentenced to the "public security law".
The man was ordered by the Defence Minister when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were issued to the police.
It is the weakest appeal within the law and there is no reference to criminal purpose.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "It would have thought that it would be in the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be called is sentenced in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause which is subject to the safe conservation of information.
The King State Authority recommended that the officers should be complained by the Metropolitan police for the highest sensitive nature of its work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.

He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought to a secret place from his house.
Apartment construction companies see costs in the eye
British housing companies may be in the house after the saving of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect the installations of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interests for this loan are paid by all enterprises receiving money from investors, including the 59 building companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Communities of Apartments (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "indirect," that the companies and their members should pay.
The $14 billion will be finally paid if Bradford & Bingley's credit is granted.
However, the interests in the interim period are calculated each year by 700 financial undertakings to take payments.
The programme for compensation of financial services confirmed the BBC that the 59 accommodation companies are included in this number.
It's worse that those institutions that have behaved awareness... are now called to take some of the costs of those institutions that were clearly less accurate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company in relation to the funds that it would hold should be paid, and that the companies should pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interests for the credit will be of 450 million funds in 2009.
This means that corporations must create 81 million funds for the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Apartments of Apartments, shared the BBC that he believed that this is unfair.
It is worse that those institutions who have been carefully conducted during the real estate reserve are now calling some of the costs of those institutions, which were very fewer.
According to the BSA, no company has been held since the existing registration in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter about the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from significant costs."
The interests that will be affected in 2009 shall depend from the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interests will be made for a full year and could almost be a double.
Since companies are mutual organizations without corporate organizations, their members shall be paid by higher costs or lower interests in spending accounts.

New investigation in the US state lawyers
The American General Avocat has employed a special missionary to consider the accused of nine State lawyers in the United States in 2006.
The record was a report of the general Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the acts of the administrative employees were criticized.
The report was critical to the officers of the knowledge house, lawyers and the former general lawyer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was carried out by the fears that the lawyers have been excluded by political reasons.
The Special Marriagester Nora Jahangehy now should explain whether the officers held during the investigation have lied the investigators in order to defeat the justice.
In its report, the general Inspector Glenn Fine has not been completely investigated or closed.
One of his main recommendations was the profession of a special fleetman with the power to force witnesses to speak.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine US State lawyers from their employees enthob.
At this time, the Ministry argued that state lawyers would be dealt with less working services.
However, later, it was found that the abandoned State lawyers were not worse than many of their colleagues, which many observers decided to consider the claims as politically motivated.

The meat Loaf's epical song must be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music price "Q Award" for his epical hymne "Bat Out of Hell".
The song that will take its special gold price during the delivery in London next week, said he was honored to be acknowledged.
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title room at Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" means the namements for price loan this year after it came into the closer selection in four categories.
The publisher of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go through materials such as time and gene and "Bat Out of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song that was sent by Jim Steinman requested a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared in Britain as a single one in 1979 in sale and reached place 15 in the Chart.
However, Meat Loafs had passed about nine years in the Charts and sold over 40 million times in the world.

Obscure street in city, often forget and eventually sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, page routes and other environmental roads, where some are famous and others are only well-known.
However, it is even hard to say for experienced taxi drivers and long-year-old local accommodation where there is extra place, simply because most of them have never heard it.
This wide street is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street North Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks better after a steel gas than after an active driveway.
There are no road switchs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard distance plan.
However, this street has their admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built a luxurious building on the First Street.
It wants to create extra places to make a cleaner driving to the ships and bottles that are expected in the new buildings.
The long-year neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short gas, just because it is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city management department responsible for the protection and establishment of the housing building and is responsible for the road does not interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Joint Council for Agricultural Use in this month, representatives of the city management and Avalon Bay have proposed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new plan to be presented in the next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the Council 3.
"But very little room has remained in the owner of the city and we want to hear the extra place still listening to the city," she said.
"It could give offers how to repair the road and work what Avalon could be done, but we also want to ensure that public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that makes the small street new pools and seats that have been thought for a coffee, which would like to avoid the company's space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting in this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it wouldn't want to have them.
"The main challenges of the Avalon Bay are to renew this fallen gas and to make it public," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the building protection Department, had actually been the desire of the city to sell the road and emphasize the task of the department to develop the real estate than to be managed.
Comparisons with his friendly neighbor The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street has obtained their name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne, shared between his many children and no one was called a closer strike country.
The door of the club CBGB, the Puncrockdenkmal closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is mostly known as arts for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The pflaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was fully filled with shoes, lumps and parts of plants, potters, fibers and seals.
Some residents, including the blogger, who write about the genitalization of East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public basement, as it is, must remain public.
Others have pleaded extra place as a rareness – a practically unchanged split in the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates in the blog named "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of the Chronicles: A worse nostalgical view on the outside city), has published a part of the discussion of the city history of Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra place is a small swimming gas that is even a dark day, and is marked by the broken metal doors of the layers, closed windows and on rain swimming newspapers. "
With a few exceptions, the street has looked out soon at one night.
A Ratte passed through the back of the street, not far from the door that led to CBGB before, where there is a warm clothing business today.
Graffiti were to see on the walls and a empty beer flash on the ground was not far from a fresh stone of explanated newspapers.
Some passengers said they had thought rarely about extra place, but they thought that the street could be a little pool.
Fields added that, according to his view, some people consider the journey of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the dark, hot and equective places.
Debates on two-language education: education in English environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the positions of the candidates for two language training.
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employees in California Studies and director of educational science at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a composer of the book "No matter why the Middle Class needs a school choice."
Speaking to Spanish electioners is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obamas Election campaign mentioned that "the probability of the African and Spanish schools to successfully complete schools is lower than at white students" is true.
In order to close this performance, Obama's educational plan recommends specifically a two-langual transitional phase in training for those who are only learning English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for the two-language training, which is the main point of teaching in other languages, is contrary to its interest in reduceing the distance in education.
Let's take, for example, "Sexth Street Prep", a basic school in East Los Angeles.
Most students are Spanish and from families with low income.
More than a third of the students whose many are already in the country have learned English.
However, in 2008 the surprising 100 percent of the fourth class students had the state test in Mathe at a good level.
Similarly, 93 per cent of the children from the fourth school year in the English test were well evaluated.
This surprising success has been achieved with other methods than those who are favoured by Obama.
The Sixth Street School lends its main point on review and training, on the steady control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach to training in an English environment. That is the point to view Obama, so the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach reflects the almost exclusive use of the English language in the specialistic education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of two language training, said to me that the school had a great success with a student who had first been from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be involved in the classroom and can't recognise it again.
"It works", she noted, "it works for us."
Will Obama take a school such as the "Sexth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share in Latin American and other English students?
The performance of schools would facilitate the answer to this question, but the training policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations are supporting the idea of two language training) and their own support for the second language training predictions about Obama's response.
While he agreed to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic, noting that people should stop, worried about the legislation aimed at "Single English".
Instead, he said, "You must ensure that your child can be Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance rate, he should take care of the education models that work instead of causing and trivialize them.
The oil price results in renewed fears for the economy
The earthly oil price is on Monday because of the fears that even the American Relief Plan for Financial Markets could not re-establish the economy.
The raw oil finances at New York Trade Offices have fallen at $99.80 per barrel in the sunday session.
Since last Monday the price has been decreased by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been threatened both by the financial turbulences at Wall Street and by the strong weaken towers in the Golf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their level of $145.29 per barrel in July, they have fallen almost $90 per barrel in this month to return as a result of the huge incertitude in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already shown concern, although they had announced the Congress Ministers, they would have joined themselves on a relief plan that should be the greatest of the story.
This message was exceededed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been closed at any time.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, a government communication on Monday is intended to purchase the wachovia Corporation bank business.
Interimly, Belgium, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalized the European Financial Conferences in part.
After analysts at Barclays Capital, it is apparently not possible to experience the stimulation of market markets, despite the admissible negotiations that took place at the weekend.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, inter alia by oil, will continue to decline.
The analysts of the German bank have written in a communication to investors that the prognoses for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become indeed uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the good markets will also be affected.
"Besides the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is expanded worldwide, especially to China."
The bank analysts have made their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year following, and their prognoses for oil and gas price for 2009 are 20%.
In the second quarter of the series
Shaun Elis thought he had seen everything after he was opened in the last eight and half years than anyone else in the Jet tricky.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second fourth, in which the Jets turned a game without being a triumph.
"I've never seen something like that," said Elis.
After a crazy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, who spoke to the bad weather, started the second fourth.
However, when the Quarterback Brett Favres Pass at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year-old touchdown, it marked the perfect attack on a afternoon on which their developed cooperation made an exhibition.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which one time as an external defense and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't particularly tried," Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles Fangen played, the defence of the Quarterback Kurt Warner took part.
Foreign defended Darrelle Revis started a lacking snack and converted it into a 32-year touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then careed for a loss of warner.
The last ball lost, injured at Bowens, was probably the worst.
The cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game than the Jets returned the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-year shoes to 34 to 0 drive.
These were most of the points that the Jet had ever achieved in a fourth.
When he was asked to describe the sense, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
On the answers both, since the Jets left 21 points to be achieved without one single, Mangii said, "Crede me, I have met the second fourth more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in short time."
Expected Gentlemen Sections Success its World Record
Haile Bergselasion from Ethiopia has again shown why some of them keep him for the best long-term trailers all the time after he broke his own record in Berlin on Sunday and became the first person who has done the trail of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory of the flank course in 2:03:59, birth has improved his previous result of 2:04:26 at 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Burrselassie, 35, has set up its 26th world record in his multidimensional carriage, where he has reached at least a world mastership statue to Marathon or established a world record on each road of a kilometer to Marathon.
Last month, birth layssium left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fear that it may have been overcoming in the afternoon that air pollution could deteriorate its asthma problems.
Instead, he registered himself for the competition fight in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the start of the sun and 9 degrees and 13 degrees at the target - weakness has won with a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per miles.
Since rail flights such as Bernlessie and Paul Tergat from Kenia have changed on long-term trails, the record time for Marathon in the past 10 years has fallen over 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 with the results 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After his victory on Sunday, he had reported the press, he had had powers in his car two weeks ago and couldn't train one week ago.
Of course, he has been freed after the breakfast and not cut back.
"I'm so happy," he said to report.
"All have been perfect.
I took the training back a week ago, and today I had some more concerns, but at the end of everything best."
He was criticized, especially in Kenia, Ethiopian Rivales from East Africa, that he is extremely orchestrating his skins, many of the world's most worldly marathon stars, who are too expensively left on the rail leaders than whether it would be a rail, and the world's record over the coast.
However, this criticism is little harmful in the size of the Bergselassis as long-stretch flowers.
At Sunday four Kenians reached the center of the trails in 1:02:04.
Two elite drivers from Kenia, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to demand the temporary machines.
Some more than three miles before the Finnish has been made his last arrival to share from Kwambai, who has arrived as the second in 2:05:36, and so its best time has improved nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi was a third party in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kasachstan and now Germane, has completed a wonderful year by showing the seventh result of all times.
The World Reorder of 2:15:25 takes Paul Radcliff from Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko was surprised to win the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She passed the games in Beijing, because of problems described as a retreat. However, she tried to win in Berlin and improve its best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She planned his path by making her a quarter from Ethiopian and Kenyan swimming out, but over 30 kilometers later.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenia was a third party in 2:25:01.
The pride and the spots in the life of the black population, in a city of the very special type
Hidden between the evacuation of the free-time parks in the around of Orlando, a few miles away from the lingery, sweet and gigantic trails, is a peaceful city where the pride and the complications of the African cultures appear.
Eatonville, the first largely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is not more simple to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 seas, three crowd places, 300 flowers houses, 300 good swimming pools, more than enough shops, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pink place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that she describes – and she made it to a tourist flight by taking it into the Florida travel leader, which was produced at the time of the depression of the Federal Officer project – in many senses, a place of the entirely special species.
Eatonville is so independent and private as in the 1930s, as Hurston wrote, that rural black communities often refused to share their real thoughts with the weird man, which "as little knows about us that he didn't know what he does".
Even today, in a year in which Senator Barack Obama, a black president, Senator Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, there are still many regrets to be observed by external seminars.
"We are very interested in how our history is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a inhabitants of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville has been defined for a long time as paradox of the Triumphe and the fight.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is doubled as the country average.
It is one of the tops of literature and, on the other hand, an example of, sometimes condemned, sometimes, a black culture of the rural southern, which has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hair.
And so right, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all Hurston called here.
She introduced their hometown in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth like "Mils and Men" (1953) and "There Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leader changed the city, which is close to the 77 road, a street leading through the often forgotten Floridas centre to the sights of black history and human drama.
Like Oscar as well as in the real life and literature, Hurston readers led to the load of Eatonville's first citizen master, Joe Clarke, and then moved to private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "the green - obviously strict modern schools, with their planted gardens and game places, to care for the Howard Millennium, although he can read and write few."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "always sales any kind and pass to hours rooms."
In few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel leader.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was estimated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, turned out the Hurston, sitting the men who read the songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual reactions.
She added, "There's some people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively expert, who returned regularly after their family was taken to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston was used in the city, she usually did this without warning, in a smooth chevrolet, smoking and smoking with hosen, in a city, the same is in the very honourable style of clothing today.
According to Mr Franklin, most people were fascinated, but many of them were viewed.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "elle remained never too long," he added while he looked in his store, on a terrace that looks at the Sabelia Lake, in the Hurston of all likelihoods.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and struck her books.
With the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was one of the famous authors, a timegeist Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous Grab.
In Eatonville there was no big deal, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understanded their contribution in the world or heritage in the most recent", says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography on Hurston was published in 2003.
The wine came in the 80s.
Orange Council authorities wanted to put a five-pure car trains through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the long-purpose main roads of the community.
Orlandos fronts had already crossed the 4 cars through the western city border.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still repeated from a difficult phase in his history.
The relatively idylic isolation of the community, inter alia, had ended.
In the 50s, the fight against racial disappearance of Hass took place in the Community.
"In that time, a shock of white kids came, and they were persons and witnessed to the people who were sit down," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman killed there.
They were a water meal out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to demand the Supreme Court of Justice to integrate its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as “political instead of my race”.
People today say that even though the restraint of race was positive in some aspects, she weaked the group association in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youth.
"Shere children were intended to be disappointed - I remembered of it - they were struck his teachers in the morning and were slaughtered his teachers on the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the leading director of the public group for the protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be received so long, and it was added to them until teachers and students came out of the same place.
"He didn't throw his white teachers, because he was a white teacher - I have a cultural club", said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of a place for another Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, artists and artists, who moved on on predicts, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and words, as: "Whyever may reject the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began to fight for the re-emergy of her spirit.
Five years later, a lot of Hurston biography was to find Robert E. Hemenway in the book records and made it again part of the American literature channel.
The television project came exactly at a time when the famous daughter of Eatonville was once again in the light of publicity.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw them as a rescue.
In 1988, the community began planning a Hurston Festival to show what could destroy the area with the construction of cars.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many returned to the party every January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-pure television trails the city, accelerated the entire speed of speed, slowed the real citizen lolz," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed something more easyer: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the television project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more inquiries, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to the church since 1993, and the inhabitants began to recalling the past.
Eatonville was registered in 1998 in the country-wide historical record.
A new smooth library (notably called for Hurston) opened in 2006 on the renewed and enhanced Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville is like a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos, it may sometimes feel like a winter in the summer rain as small as it was found by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He is today at 90% black.)
Foreigners at the search for the story of Eatonvilles and its importance are still being treated with care.
For most interviews, a approval is needed in the preview and certain things - as the walling of Eatonville's old church, which was formed by a knowledge and represents black men in the field work - should not be photod.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a favorite for dark red, still fear that their disregarded community will be misunderstanding.
And yet, at the same time to which the Hurston Festival was greater, there was also a increased degree of homestolz.
In particular, young people are close to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: wonderful, with all its problems, nor worse, nor better or just so proud, creative and flexibility, albern and sweet as any other group of races and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is ready to return to the college to Eatonville, to work in the city management or to the police, which might use some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"The majority of the people who walk here will be thinking, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon newly on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York, a flight-filling finance.
At first, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were closed from the newspapers and the violent television screens in the Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in a debakel.
They would never believe that on their heads, in the shooting offices with the glassfassades, bankers and hedge fund managers, who have the Monopol in New York, daily have the worst horror day since 1929.
The delivery continues to shoot the metal twins along the citizens and transported tablets that are stolen with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos continue to be between apartments, how human patches are struggling with the 50-year-old T-shirts that spend on a joch-year stage on their shoes.
The officers still waited at the citizens on their breakfast bathroom and it is still unable to get a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 hours.
It wasn't feeling like a crisis until I decided to open a new sport account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I decided to launch my duty timely on my JP Morgan Chase stammfiliales, about 20 people were sweet.
Not to the money switchers to take or pay money, but to the customer service switch scheck books where the sisters are ordered, to ask tourists on the way to buy the Macy's shopping house and to open new customers accounts.
The majority before me, so later I learned from Starr, my "private bank officers with license" were on the same basis as I sweet.
On the contrary to me, they had already taken their part of smaller banks, where they were pending from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and state Island.
They had lost the money of such trifts (unlike a little of a building parking), the company banks and local sparcakes that had only been in a state of filial, and say they treat their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks were quiet and low.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion, in competition management, and as a read freeday of New York over weekend to home, was Wachovia, another bank, has $440 billion spans with the value of $440 billion, on the search for a saving buyer.
In the fear of a further invasion, the officers and ladden officers, who were in front of me, had their bars to be seen as a safe port, a bank responsible for most of the savings purchases at Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have been able to fly in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese sugar market, took so much confidence to Lehman Brothers, the pleite bank and her apparent President Dick Fuld, as she would be over a faul colleague.
And Lyn, who has been uniformized for the 50-year-old concierge of my living blocks, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I have now all my loans in money market funds", she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to get risk."
Muslim buildings slaughtered during the legal rush in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a member of the Austrian legal freedom party, and Philip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Rights Pertei Vlaams, took part in a demonstration in Antwerpen on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization 'Cities against Islamization'.
They take shields in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is formed, switched with a red line.
The police condemns the legal extremists of decrease on a Muslim Friedhof in Austria, representing significant wins at the extreme right party's election of the country at the same weekend.
Tonight of Friedhof on Tuesday, more than 90 guests were injured at the Friedhof in Traun at Linz, in a police, organized action.
The murders expressed Jewish symbols such as the David stars on some of the farmers, but the criminal officers keep this to try to spend the motivation of the extremists conducted by the Hass on Muslim Immigrants.
It is not clear whether the case is in any way connected to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic Community said they were "the most painful" about the message of the crowd that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans at the end.
At the same time, in Austria, a round conscience research has been made after the country was cut right in the strict parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, both largely directed by the two parties, almost 30% of the votes, took place in their election camp for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their elections were criticized by the enemy as an alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who wins 18% of the voices, took place for a prohibition of heads and Burkas and even reported his appeal against foods that are generally linked to the Islam.
In his last committee in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of Moscow and Minorists with the argument that these political symbols are a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analysis that were performed directly after the election and indicated that the extreme rights of the politically strongest block in the country indicated that this new development is based on young elections that are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Traveller for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, sentenced by the sexual abuse of children, was legally subjected to travel to France and Spain.
The judiciary took a six-money specimen after he informed the controlling authorities, he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted the last Thursday to spend a foreign slaughter after she presented the proof of the complaints for the offenders because of the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, was not attended by the Ashford Officer in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
EIn speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent requested the police to prevent foreign travels from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personal."
As required by the Register for Sexual Criminal Criminal Discrimination, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he would want to travel to the foreign.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the Foreign for more than three days.
He must also report the police seven days before his planned departure.
The advertising of the authorities may lead to a prison penalty of five years.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss any cases or pieces of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything to protect children in this country and in the foreign."
"In our view, it is easy to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent effectively any potential risks."
"It is the main concern of the police in Kent to protect the people of Kent, and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Letter returned the last month to the United Kingdom after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamian prison because of abusing of 2 girls in age of 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, the glitter was fled to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the pass control and he fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities rejected him also and returned to Bangkok, where the Thai police and border officials found that he returned to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he came to Heathrow at Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there during his lawyer David Corker to the office of Uxbridge in West-London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval, to ask him to register himself as sexual criminals.
Letter has been arrested for four months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Minister of Internal Affairs Jacques Smith is based and satisfied that guitters have been stopped traveling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the bridge to keep his characters', shoes Brauer, photograph.
No paragraphs, no shoes, no costims for the arrival.
The nature of the large flamencotangents who refuse to concentrate and seek the interpretation to obtain a disappointed look as a woman or man.
One of the artists
Otherwise, personality
I see in private lives, in these moments that are for the public alien, I know when I can find for the personality typical bees, the depth of a stealed view or the expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not involved in the blues.
In his ‘Flamenco-people’ project, the German photograph Sonder Bauers is a variety of incentives on the bridge with songs, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still a little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photograph creates a special ionography of flamencodification at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of the Flamenco photography, 'respectives the international importance of Flamenco, which is always greater from day to day', explains the artist and clearly makes that 'Flamenco-people' may be a person favorable, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that it is no typical images of artists on the bridge.
All normal people on the port are artists that can be able to meditate on the painful suffering, joy, and thus move the public.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you must not make photos on the bridge.
Your personality and character is in their hearts.
What I was interested to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to keep the characters of the largest flame committee with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photo songs, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, existing images that remember the classic photography.
The application of various styleistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, by the image the modernity and the idea, as it understands Flamenco: `Music with traditional reasons that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the instrument game or the instrument game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which flows with his art the public.
The search for the essential, after a certain thing that is visible in the form of his ear, was and was the vast goal of this work that is presented in the next time in the galerie of El Fotomata.
Announced personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists that were photographed.
The project has become anthology of the flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all ports from the exhibition.
Bauers suffered from the portuge, he was able to take this idea two years ago and to implement as ‘ports of the sport’ (“sportART Project”).
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project are different, the photograph is very likely to picture the people, to learn them and to move me into their life condition, is it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think the portrait is the most difficult gateway in the area of photography.
You smell or smell people, personalities that you sometimes don't know, or they leave you for a couple minutes alone to make a photo.
Unlike these circumstances, I always try to achieve my ideas."
The collection of the ports of the flamencos from today with the title ‘Flamenco-people’ is located in the galerie of El Fotomata, which is located on the street with the name the street de la Mata and is parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition can be viewed until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa claims that the Rome, which he just writes, is "a toll curiosity".
He still don't know where the acts of the Romans are and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to make the project he just worked, a Roman with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went to the Amazon area.
Last night, while his presence on the Ha Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel prices gave the project with which he is employed 'a toll cooking' and 'all knows that he should not write to the Roman'.
'If I would be struggled, I would not do it, but I will do it and hope to end the Roman', he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were discovered. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historic, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La City y os perros' was one of the most beautiful personalities on the third festival and made prognosis.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the festival of the Hai Festival, and which most of the presents make their voice, is compared with the old output of 'Our mutual friend' and is seeing in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a public before himself, which noted that the Peruvian who had a wonderful memory and a great humble feeling was given enough time to continue to do anything again: how his profession was towards literature, which was derived from ‘excellent absent’, of ‘Free in reading’ and ‘more experiences,’ as he wrote and ‘disciplinary’, to complement his lack of inspiration’, to complement his intensive work with documentation, a number of corrections and overviews; he makes the factors of Vlegolk and Adromas’, as he writes and ‘disciplineline’, to complement his 'disciplination', to complement his work with the literature', to complement his intensive work with documentation, a number of corrections and overviews; as the factors of the Vlegour and his professionality', which is the images of the ‘the images’.
The Spanish American Romanian writer emphasized that there is “no way of life” what you can measure and where you can know whether books change the life,” but I refuse to believe that the literature is a pure entertainment, a flight experience”, emphasized Vargas Llosa, who claims that they ‘fill the effects’ and ‘the people are more out of each other’, for I ask the writer ‘I do not take the light’ and ‘the responsibilities’ for his profession.’
At the festival of Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Strift feasts cut partly.
After the announced steel fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the murder of the murder, which was to be completed in Pozoblanco on the morning.
Thus the eventist decided to move the fighter with a understanding of Ferdinand Bohórquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
Thus, the celebration of the inconsistent strike was deleted, for two of three partys could not be held.
On Saturday, it was not possible to celebrate the second struggle scheduled.
The maturity group was taken from José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, which were after and taken by and after.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luke, who cut off three ears and triumphated after which he had left the path with joy and sthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two ears and one of the ears, which was more than he had reached by the gallopiers than by his warfare.
And even worse, El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without smile.
After he fought so bad, a majority of the public reacted in his second battle with Buh-Ruees.
In Alava, two persons wanted to get out of the control of their cars that had been struck with two thousand kilos of Hassch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Alava).
Two police officers requested the drivers to keep their car, where they took the fleet.
It looked like she should not stop with the load of more than 2 000 kg Haschish.
The police followed her and took one of the drivers who was 28 years old, known as A.A. J., as it was informed by the National Ministry of Basken State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and of official documents.
The case occurred when transport police officers of the Alava region had already completed transport controls on the N-1 and overlooked the city area of Armenians.
They decided to keep a car to perform the route controls. The driver did not follow the instructions, soon increased the speed and tried to remove the control.
The police began the persecution until the car reached a few kilometres from the border. In that moment, the drivers came out of the car to fly through a land road to a forest area.
Finally, the police of the city of Ertzaintza took one of the worms. In the car, a Iveco Daily, the drug chairman transported 2,178 kg Haschsch, which was invited by the police.
The prior part of the car was shocked with hashich bands, which later led to the specific laboratory analysis and to the decline of the band to other police services.
The officers also found that the sign 'doppelt' was, so that it did not agree with the character specified in the Kfz paps, as a result of an invasion of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertza continues to investigate the detention of the second suspect, which, as already mentioned, could run, but also to determine the origin of the invited drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was sent to a police office, which is submitted to the detention director in the next hour.
Shooters Heather Locklear were arrested because of the driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The artist Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda from the "Merrose Place" series, was found at this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of the drive under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness has observed how she tried to go in a strange way from their park in Montecito, reporting the transport police of California to the Magazine 'People'.
The Witness told details that Locklear was pressing at 16:30 a.m. and made a lot of laugh by trying to move her car down or forward from the park, and when she turned back, she went to her sun bridge a few times.
Somewhere later, the witness, which was beginning, probably didn't know that Locklear took place on a near street and increased the car.
The Witness was the person who deserved the emergency, because she had lived 'the fear of Locklears'.
When the police tricks arrived, they settled in their car, which wanted to stand on the road and blocked the transport.
'It seems to be unoriented' because they needed the police in a special drug and alcohol centre to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the shooting players had been excluded by the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials were to follow, we believe that Lockler was under the influence of an unknown medicine', as the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of conducting an indefinite substance that could not be determined and enforced at 19 p.m. in a local investigation.
Two months ago, Locklaer was left after a treatment from the clinic in Arizona where it was treated against fear and depression.
Llamazares is responsible for the case of Silva, the Analous Association of the United Nations Links.
Gaspar Llamazares, the principal coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Nations, has now assured that the regional association for education will be those who will be the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sports of the Council House in Sevilla, France Manuel Silva, which was returned to the week after he was accused of making business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a large federalist, and the elastic organization will be those who must take the responsibility to take,' Llamazares indicates what action the party must have to be against, which is until now as a city council in the Joint Council of Sevilla.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for transparency in the possible investigations of Sylva’s distortions that could have started: ‘The VL was always to receive the maximum transparency’.
In terms of this theme, he stressed that the education 'a more strict ethical codex for all public employees'.
‘Sangre de Mayo’: Garci' Helden book
Inspirited by "Episodios Nationales" of Benito Perez Galdoos, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous state of Spain against the Frenchs. This is a wonderful film in the film, with approximately 15 million euro investments for the carriage work.
In this way, the Cineast tried to ‘a quantity of personalities and social analysis’, which he always admired the works of the famous Romanist, explained Carci today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the donor.
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday in Kinos is presented and later shows on the telemadride as a fourth ministerial.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdoos, ensures that his ‘Kindnessstraum’ was fulfilled. This has been grateful for Esperanza Aguirre, who has been assigned him three years ago from the self-nome Community of Madrid to turn a film on the second century in Madrid, particularly because the story was based on the basis of 'Episodios Nationales'.
The total amount of 15 million, which was set by the autonome Community Madrid for dry work, offers Garci, as he added, the 'excellent opportunities' with decorations and suitable clothes, the image of the 'concerned Spain, which the false leader for the fighting, because the people had been resigned by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Federation of VII.'.
However, the Chinese regrets that you could not recall with the financing, such as ‘Alatriste’ or ‘Los fantasmas de Goya’ (seven times high than ‘Sangre de Mayo’), so some scenes from the threshold book with the Horacio Valcarcel, who worked almost all his carriage.
For this reason, Garci, who was also the film director in the ‘Volver a begin’, showed that he was "motive" and respectful, was a part of the film director's professionals to provide help in the theatre and the cinema to know what is in the cine industry where he worked.
Many offerers in the Sangue de Mayo have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar Candidate in four names (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates representing Spain's Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither ‘Sangre de Mayo’, nor ‘Sangre de Mayo’, nor ‘Search the billar French’ and finally not the selected film ‘Los Girassos ciegos’.
For this movie, Garci does not expect a marking.
'After you think you're working for the birthday, then you notice that it's only for pleasant, and now you're satisfied when you're still produced a film', Garci explains, after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayon calls the memory to the dancer of Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencotationer from Sevilla is a dance that also stands from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Flornez Tortola Ferrari) and the mother of Andalusirin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), which was born in the fourth triana, and when she was three years old, her family was killed to London.
She was a dancer and experts for Eastern dancers.
She had a huge life, she was one of the first fighters for the emmancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist, vegetarine, and put himself for the decrease of the corset, which limited the free women's movement.
The life of this woman, who left her shoes at the Dance and Ethics Revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested that role that couldn't happen to me."
'We do not try to tell her life to keep their spring,' said the flamen cottagin.
Your dance bases have helped me in Flamenco.
"The dance of the smetterling" came to me, for example, as Guajira, or 'the dance of the slange' like Tango.
Your dance was sensitive, and I was said that my dancing are also in this Asian area," she says.
The incentive is calculated with two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, which will be sing for Isabel again in one of their ideas, as he also did in the ‘La Porte open’; and with Flamenco-Mester Matilde Coral, who wanted to work closely with one of her former students.
'Matilde plays Tortola, a very ridicule personality.
I am happy because she agreed to work on my work, and I feel very honored."
The incentive is also calculated with the musical composition and the guitarists of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the genuine of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pajaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the artist Juanfra Júarez, and he “preserves the role of the guest of the artists who were Divas, where he always loved again”.
This work is also mentioned in a certain way of this woman's life, which has been known in so far places as India, the United States and Russia, and also in all Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in mind, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain era, and their works today no more and they are still less white,' says Bayon.
The idea is placed at 20:30 in the Lope de Vega theatre today.
The publication of the book 'Diario de a poeta new homedo' also encloses the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated output of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where John Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry the planned activities in order to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is the memorial of the fifty-year of the literature prices and the deaths of the two.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new output of this work, with the international congress held in New York with the restoration of the home museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia, and the ‘Juan Ramón Jiménez’ exhibition, which was opened in May, and which has been reached in different locations in Andalusia, now New York and was presented in the loop of the international conference.
The Analusian Council for Cultura has also received athundert Exemplare of `Diario de un poeta recién homedo', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and work of the Analusian world shower.
The United States can feel bad without Paul Newman
'A sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence is from the artist Sally Field, who cooperated with him in the 'Senssion Reporter', and from the then dominant idea of the US cinema, which was left in the stage, came from the whole United States to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed it.
Look at what she costs to give him the Oscar.
And when he went back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
However, it was a great shock for everyone.
'What sometimes feels, is significantly more than a expression, and now I lost a great friend', said Robert Redford shouted, 'My life and my country were the greatest trials of his life'.
No one had no fear to make himself laugh, nor to overcome.
As a ‘pater’ of the cine and paterna, he died in a tragic moment, in the fear of terrorists and the market adjustment, where the unexpected self-valuement of the United States in the unexpected search for reasons for re-establishment.
If there are only few people that can be admired in this hard time, you don't need to be Lus Cernuda in order to love Paul Newman.
For all he was almost a platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and experienced as various losses as well as wins: the Foundation, which wrote to the fight against the drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage that died at overdose, was founded to the own brand of household and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it costs much effort to take place against a mortal food culture.
A wide wave of the surprising suggests to take on Hollywood no attention to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole time.
The English Sam Mendes, director of the film and Oscar Prices said that the work with Newman was not less than his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, waved to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all', said George Clooney, maybe one of the few who are trusting to live today, as Paul Newman lived: high demands for justice, a responsible private life, which leads away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in the current media ring.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though there were certainly many opportunities to be not.
"Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have a home file?" he shouted often.
In heaven, he will be proud that his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not unlikely in America.
"For all the great roles that he played, he was not so proud of the faithful marriage, the loving Father, the observed Opas and the Philanthrop," they say.
For the Olympic games, the streets in Madrid are missing.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to celebrate some of the olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the disaster for 2012, maybe 2016.
But I ask me, ‘Do we prepare for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true!
She was called as a perfect road, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with all the drunk and drunk that it was.
Of course, it's a lot of disagreement if you look at the evaluation and I could check it, it would not be obvious.
But, let's go from the beginning to everything.
The instinct starts with the tickets that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad, but if they're letting you go, then they should give you everything (including Chip to avoid the stage on the street).
So don't.
Here they allow you only to take the ticket (the first intelligence there is, only because to go there) and (only after an infinite waiting speed) there is the surprise! The T-shirt only gave it in the size of 'S' (a second instinct because I need the XL size)
Where are we living?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to purchase only a lot more smaller, less substance hairs?
Well, things like these are a littleness compared to the days on the road.
Unlike you have to go very early to take the chip, there's a waiting speed of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the switch.
The waiting has longed more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected, is unreasonable.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our back box, even if it was a time, but it would be harder to repeat it again.
Moreover, in these 40 minutes waiting time for rain, so it came to the attempt to organize a people’s residue and overcome the rain.
I think that the morning will certainly have some 500 people with the lamination and some like me will be because of this chip I got, not even appearing at the classification at the time, I can already think that the start was wrong.
Surely, if you would ask me after a perfect road, this street would never attack me.
So I think we're gonna have a long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic games
Microsoft search for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a kind of artistic intelligence without much intellectuality, but which is able to perform some primitive tasks, such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route plan to move on the company' camp). The system notes what it listens during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and visual recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who are and even remembering how they were expected, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It is also possible to order the attendants to the groups after the meetings.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation, and that there is no company advisor.
She wonders if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that he will soon listen to her.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressed
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things that can focus it, for example, on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week, it was very overwhelming about Microsoft's strategic exchange.
Windows 7 will be faster and do not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers would be equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling the commercial mould, they would work five times faster.
Everything is only a determination when you remember that Microsoft was added one or another function and 'Extra' in Windows versions.
The direction change is rejoicable
Microsoft has the right, the operational system loses its importance as well as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many of them show that the browser is not an operational system.
The operational system, as an unreliable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can operate simultaneously.
The operational system shall comply with the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it is about to communicate something to his mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think about your 'Tod', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operational system every time, so more to the web browser.
The computer is just starting to execute the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrom and we take more time on the surfing than in the area of the 'window'.
What is the half of the available applications in the computer?
Reverse is more
And Windows 7 must be compacter, much more compact than Vista.
Easy, not overcome, less complex.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services that can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need this, without doubt, and I bring a small example for it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of Microsoft reception spaces at the beginning of the month.
On the refrigerator automate, a shield is confirmed: `You are searching. Our future'. It is pressed for a request to use your online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google used for searching in the network.
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not begin but appear at the end of 2009, even before 2010.
Microsoft seeks the possibility to get Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously on the brand.
Every day the phone becomes a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in the 'Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in "The Pate" of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a good-building worker.
When we start to tell the innumerable Stars adventures, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a split bart that had been higher in a waller circle weight.
On the basis, this is a typical male T-shirt from tree-wool, smellless and smooth.
The English languages call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels refers to all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, although it is called “Marcel” in the closest circle. The legend said that the name exhibition is connected to sports and by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the favorite leader of the Singlester Edith Piaf.
The ‘La Marcel’ refers to all because of its wonderful tree coal, because of its distinct Unisex speed, and is marked by a small Belgian fahne (as recognisable) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the hill exit.
And attention, the Belgian company concentrates not only on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardians and Cashmire, Hospital holes, T-shirts with strips, babies, Mini Shorts
Model and convenient subconditions.
However, it is very harmful to use them as sub-advertising.
You're very exciting.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great presence with her sister did not stop developing her own personality.
Monique Cruz is awesome, but full of life joy.
Their new activities are now very serious in the mode.
For Monica, it means more than for some nice and rich girls that keep their call.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, where she was located, and also the representation of the most important premiums in the Spanish mode that sponsors the Spanish Model House.
Barmed and protected, winner on the short roads.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this original/Winter season, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and also I visited the presentation of the second version of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner at Valentinos Hore.
A very intensive worktime that is simultaneously surprising.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I'm fascinated from the cine of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
On the other hand, I'm going through a city and watching women how they're pretty, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Tanners, shoes and modedesigners, you're a very wide woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything is in one and these areas has many communities.
Since I was small, I was sweet from the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to select my tank's clothing limits and to see their clothes.
It was super, almost better than going to a free-time park.
Soon, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we can dance so much to have our own style in teaching and with the samples to look at the spiegel and feel good about it.
As shoes players, if you get the cost, you're in the real spectacle role.
Finally, everything will be connected to each other, it is so much respect for the cost designers and their professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, you didn't lose a crisis?
Oh, that's it.
I feel better than you than 30 years old, I feel good.
I find that the woman will rief, have experience and can enjoy life with less errors.
I'm not afraid of my biological hour.
I wanted to do the things I've been small since, and that gave me much internal joy.
So you think you're going to be a mother, right?
Since a long time I know that I'm going to be a mother, because this requires my body and also I'm going to be a young mother; that's not gonna let me get away.
I don't worry about the candidate.
I'll give my child a lot of happiness and learn it with a lot of love.
As regards the film art, you're looking at the work you've participated and rounded the last year.
That is, and I want to very much to be presented by the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, is very pacience and disappointed and wants to have everything to do, of course not soon.
I very wish that 'The last hour' and 'In search for the tumba of Christ' will be recorded first time.
See how they got you
A couple of days ago, you looked at Naomi Campbell's turning up with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not so that I went to the start to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a few years, has just called me and invited me to London to make a parade for the welfare event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothings from our college for Mango were increased to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomis's good heart.
There's a lot of things about them, and I would tell you that they don't agree.
However, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a manner, I'll also do it.
In order to support women in the third world, what is also necessary.
The car drivers that can be disrupted because of the alcohol level are required to install the 'alcolock'.
The Authority states that the driver who had three official punishments because of the alcohol level has installed in his car that this system prohibited to start the car in the shocked state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not switch up.
The initiative has been announced in June in the last month and is now part of the report of the General Advocate-General, and it is a pilot project that will long for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, because it is a course for the processing of the conduct of transport.
Apart from the General State Authority, in accordance with the investigation, the Ministry of Transport and the Fundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Autos will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the drivers, which had been displayed more than one time because of the driving under the alcohol impact, they were rearranged to tax.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it lacks alcohol content in the atmosphere and prevents the autostart when the driver has tested; or if a alcohol concentration is identified, which is higher than allowed.
More than 1 000 euros are costed, the costs are carried out by those related to the sanction.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars that have been equipped with these devices have been prevented by 65 % of the regular disruptions in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved annually.
The measures are limited to the administrative action because of two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a crime.
In order to facilitate its implementation, a legislative reform can be achieved on the common way, and it is, however, required a reform of the basic law that is necessary for the criminal persecution process.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, no business available, although it has already been built in some useful vehicles and vehicles of the public transport.
The Deputy will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which proposes to install this system in school bus, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British fiction, at 17:40 p.m. to the hour provided by the program, besides the Presidential Hangar of the Mino Juárez de Mexico Airport, the Spanish aircraft aircraft flights traveled with the prince and prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but its trails have still able to use the hand as the sun screen to see the king couple that came out of the flight.
Direct to the Gangway: the Spanish mailers and other authorities
A couple hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia would visit the city to formalize the official travel.
- Oh, very good, so, there's nobody to take you from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish girl, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Well, very good.
But the mexican press knows exactly who is the prince and the prince of Asturia and knows the importance of traveling.
There are many who waited at the Hangar of the airport and on the red kitchen, including military protection of 27 marine soldiers.
The prince appears to be laughing, waiting in the sea, and she, the prince, with long hair covered from the wind, without a common 'peep-toes', may have been informed that it is expected to be a shoe in DF.
Before they join the room, they smile and are prepared on the photographs where the official follow-up is expected.
At the door of the hotel where they are undergoing, one of the four largest in the city is waiting for a reporter from Mexico’s television that makes fun.
The best premium of the mode
It is likely that there was no suitable place on the world as Paris to present a premium of the mode, and it was probably not an excellent model designer and Bonvivanten as Valentino.
Mango presentes the second outcome of the Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards for the promotion and international increase of young modellers.
This is equipped with money prices of EUR 300 000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first issue, has seen its descriptions in the founder of Mango Philadelphiale on Boulevard Housesmann number 54 in Paris, and has almost seen their emotional reception.
Moreover, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has been opened recently, offering a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is located in London.
So many events have been related to the model designer Valentino for his jury presidency. Everything ended with a luxus dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, they seemed to be spectacular to the root table organized by Mango.
Nati, with the serious heart that was cut off by pain, because his brother had recently died. He took the arrival of the model house and had some smokes from ELAH, which were awesome. He stood in the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two feet large, and had Valentino at the dinner with his honor.
Andik, the owner of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a covaler, so that he ended with the Rotschild bar without Jacketts, because Jacketts had led them to the lady.
Monica Cruz, who had a hose and a shoe that she modelled, and to dinner she took a long, black clothing. At a night-passing walk by the Oper, joined by Goya Toledo, they showed us a ballet trial room, so she was shocked, remembered at the old times, took a stage and made a kind of 'grand more'.
Ines Sastre, the space passed not through the rooms of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
On the next morning we could be happy about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that has always offered a stirmical event, and on John Travolta, who had requested to have a room without shoot after his arrival (with his own bedrooms and hands) in the International Hotel in Paris.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There's no 1000, but a more possibility to forget chaotic lives of our daily life.
And if it's little, all are assembled in a book where it is how to be disappointed. The book comes to book negotiations on September 30.
The weaker is a punishment when he crys at 7 o'clock, but even worse it seems to come back to the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office calls the swimming and computer that leads to the rear pain.
The stress is the wicked of the 21th century.
But there is no two methods to fight the daily creation and the problems as you disabled from the work world.
The number increases, but not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga steels, the classic massage or spa treatment, Susannah Marriott in the book provides the whole list of the possibilities that are adapted to the smell and the time each individual.
The work against stress is '1001 possibilities to relax themselves' and so comes the peace that the book gives in the negotiations of the Delegation Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplace with personal contacts, so this manuscript opposes such faith.
Furthermore, the methods will be offered to remain in contact with the nature, or to propose 100% of natural receptions that lead to deployment.
If the adrenaline in your vein does not grow up to restore the body's balance and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to add to the sofa, to stop the brain and focus on reading.
Remember in sleep
Some Kids speak night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us what happened on the day before, but the children who speak during the sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you'll be shocked, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleeping that is called the speech in sleep.
It is very wide, especially with children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you were told you have spoken night.
This phenomenon can occur (a time in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (day, once per week, once in month), on the next day, the child may not remember anything.
There is no only reason to cause this appearance.
There are often associations with other appearances in sleep, such as alptspaces, panic fears night, Enuresis noctura (beat night), speaking in bed, but there is no reason for it.
As we have previously mentioned, it may be very high fibers, stress situations or oversight.
In any case, it's a little investigated phenomena.
The frequency with which it comes is very variable.
It may be that you can speak quietly in individual words, flee or can be a very opposite (which, wine, long discussions).
In the cases where the explanation is very intensive, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted with a specialist to examine whether a problem is caused by fear and that way.
We said it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g., with sleep appnoe or stress).
What can be done is a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to smell the child before sleeping.
So search for peaceful games for the child and avoid stressing television programs that are horrible and too wild.
In the nervous children recommending dispatchs, the methods of dispatch can be used to help them get a certainty of internal peace.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
If the speech comes in sleep once, try to keep the silence.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and on the next day, there will be nothing to remember what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't stop it.
This is unuthorised, because the child is unconscious, so you will spend it out of the sleep.
Even though the child speaks, it sleeps, so it is quiet.
Remember, if a couple of appearances show, it is recommended to make advice or find out what reason the child has to fear.
If they understand what it says (which isn't so common), the child does not press to carry out an appointment and to find more information.
So you will be able to achieve nothing, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it's dreaming and why it say, because they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you take from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear this night and know his secrets.
Not even as a shock.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing crazy, it's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Ironic homes ... finally
After a long round of darkness, iron houses on the game field eventually return to success courses.
Without great effort, the glass shoes played many towers and made it to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The time of the meeting in which the angryers had to show their ability, it was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain buyer, whose television was closely on the shift, Ill houses should dominize the game with easierness, and soon it changed only the flash with a television, then the brain with a highpass, and the Romanin with a shooting with the footsteps to demand the dentists from Denmark.
The opposite mention blocked in the field and left only the vibrant Riahi on the pit of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with the first two by Riahi and Temporale fighting towers, and then with the first tower for the iron houses through Marais, which was exactly right to re-accepte a ballet that was stored in a first trial of Debold.

Sarkozy is a wrath of fishermen
Before he runs to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still make an incentive in Britain.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who locked the passengers to several Bretonic and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he comes with 'concrete proposals'.
The Chairman's visit is in place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee found by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase of the slight price, which has reached a record value of an average of EUR 1,14 per literature.
According to the publisher of the Elysepause David Martinon, the President would talk to possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the souls.'
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
On Sunday morning, they led to the Morbian and Calvado’s Protest Market, caused the stage of almost ten miles long.
The seggling of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Islands did not depend.
The half of Quiberon was limited with a sperm.
The souls are prepared on Monday by exposing their determination by they burned from early morning to rifs and palettes before the carpets of breast and Lorient's ports, while stopped in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations.
The movement turned on other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée where the fishermen did not export, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the hands of the trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Crossic in Loire Atlantics resolved the blockade of the important total raffinerie in Donges on night.
The decision from Boulogne-Sur-Mer to wait for the meeting at mid-day after decided on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec should decide on the reactions to move and its participation in the debate planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
But some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by the members of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not point out' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professionals who are not paying taxes are currently costing about 50 cent, but they believe that the rentability limit of a ship can only be reached with the same for less than 30 cent per litre.

Emmbraer takes his delivery prognoses for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculates this year with 215 flights, despite the threatening recession, as a risk for global economy.
Emmbraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer of the world, confirmed President Fredrico Fleury Curado for 2008.

AIG is willing to tax the sale of a majority of its businesses, their life insurance at international level and their age precautions in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Administrative Board was held on Sunday night to review possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.

After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks through the Deputy Chamber, which should allow some stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which was already attacked at the start of the quarter.
However, with 228 votes and 205 rejected the financial secretariat Henry Paulson the resources for which he had requested.
Nearly two of three Republicans decreased his plan.
'There is a bad picture that represents the Congress as impossible to reach a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market was on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'to be late'.
"If the project is actually condemned to the disaster (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, the American Central Bank, etc.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the griff, which would be more limited to the credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, Head of Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed the feeling of extreme urgence, "this is the day that brings the destruction of a financial company" in the United States.
Following the competition of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's bank business by its competitive citi-group.

Obama, winner by points in the first television dual
On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, there was another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As QGs expected to select both the Republicans and the Democratics, their own victory in this television duty, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
The political analytics David Gergen estimates that John McCains' performance was not sufficient to stop his return to the election questions five weeks before the presidency choose.
The Gallup Institute, which was published on Saturday, is clearly the best figure of Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain).
In the still undetermined elections, thus those who now arrived, Obama was conquering with 39% as a winner from the surveys, while a CBS survey 25% of them McCain is a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his breakfast on Thursday with the good performance that his complainant Joseph Biden is expected at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to consider them.
She has a good instinct, but warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not listen to cut his unprecedented experience in the field of the external policy in front of it, and it was very clear to submit the 'nativity' of his enemy in respect of these issues, which represented the central point of this first television duty.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand...' he stressed several times.
'I don't believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be chaired,' he also assured.
An attack point that is preached since yesterday in the Republican election position.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself short and precisely without giving himself out of the expression.
He considered his ability to take good decisions and to renew the image that has the world from the United States.
‘McCain has not yet understood Obama’, but this weekend, a democratic election pocket, which was made in the Republicans, did not have the complete extent of the crisis laid down on the 'Americans from the road'.
'After the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to tell me, but nothing about you,' Obama last night urged 20,000 people who had gathered together in a election event in North Carolina in strict rain.
He didn't even mention the words 'Mittelstand' or 'employer'. 'The financial crisis made Obama that the Americans keep to the most appropriate to save the economy even on the border of the ground, a clear advantage.
"The next week could be a decisive point of shift", estimated yesterday by the influentious democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compares the 'good economic instincts' obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis 'the conclusion of an eight-year-old economic policy which has been implemented by George Bush and is supported by Senator McCain'.
After again he pointed out that he would even create taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the deteriorations in the Wall Street, as the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a hospital insurance system, was the priority for him.
However, McCain wanted to create a plant of 45 nuclear power operations until 2030.
The two candidates are able to consider the issues of the financial market to save over 700 billion dollars last night (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress and is extremely unbelieved to the people.
'Have you noted that in Minsk there was a choice?'
Youths and oppositions demonstrated on Sunday night on the main place of the White City to delay the results of the Parliament's choices before.
Some hundreds of white Russians gathered together after the end of the election locale on the market in Minsk, to protest against the begurous characters of the Parliament's choices.
Although there was no result yet, many young ones came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator must come back.’
Some give that they have not ever chosen, 'What is useful if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has demonstrated the foreign observers in the best light to return the negotiations with the European Union is ready to comply with a democratic course.
The sanctions, including the non-releasing of Visa for 40 leading Whiterusian personalities and the resurrection of certain property, could be decreased if these choices were estimated as clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded by the election committees and our observers did not take part in the explanation', said Juri Potemkin, presses of the Union of Democratic forces, a theoretical assembly of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasized Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 Presidency election and the leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important for who speaks the voices, and with us it is the executive.
If the deputy took the opposition to the Parliament, it was because they were appointed and not selected.
However, their arrival to Parliament may mean the time in the television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. '
The opposition, therefore, is to be binding in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia is debt towards a strong debt, is in a crisis and we do not reform, we are risking to become a Russian Protector.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Union's security and cooperation organization, which has continued to be elected, does not recognize the election as valid.
It emphasizes that the election numbers are too high, and that the expansion of the stiming rate in advance (26% of Minsk choices) has cut the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice has been made,' asked the leader of the Social Democratic Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the election local.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in the Parliament, such as those who have mostly agreed with the views of the government.'
The style of the night turns back to October.
In the television, President Lukachenko and members of the Central Selection Committee welcome their success.
Subject - From blood that was resurrected again
Hema-Quebec celebrated on the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her President, Dr. Francine Decary, had all been happy because Hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she recovered the confidence of publicity that was hardly affected by the skandal of the blood damaged in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross services were seized by HI virus and hepatitis C-virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the inadequacy of publicity, the Government of Canada, in February 1994, conducted a public investigation conducted by the Judge Horace Crever, aimed at bringing light into the situations leading to such a tragedy, and preparing directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While the judges of Cancer still slowed to leave his report, several provinces then set a committee to develop a new system of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee complied this task.
According to the reports of Gelineau and Kreber, two blood banks were found in Canada: Hema- Quebec responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec took its work, not only 38% of the people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, remembered Dr. Decary.
The situation was uncomfortable.
By enhancing the security of blood conservations and working in this area in the following years, we have rewarded the confidence of publicity,” she says, before she is proud that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the people of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary, however, is conscious of ‘relivering something is extremely destructive’.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998 Hema- Quebec acted in accordance with the principle of care.
At this time, we experienced many cases of human forms of breast-feeding in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been leading to the leadership since the creation of 1998.
"And we didn't know whether this disease could be transferred over the blood.
Thus, we put on one of the main guidelines of cancer and gelineau reports, which applys excluding measures if you do not know and if a disease is slowly continued, as it is clearly in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that expresses a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who have been held in the United Kingdom for a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, this disease will be brought over the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of the care we use is a sense.
In 1999, the market appeared a much more accurate technique for recognition of HIV: the nuclei acid test (NST), which allows it to demonstrate the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the spinner, and not that the antibody against the virus, as it had been the case when the case was used.
NSTs enabled to reduce the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and the case when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our blood techniques, the specialist declares.
This time could be reduced at less than one week.
So the risk was that certain costs could be infected without knowing, and that could not be recognised significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transfering AIDS via blood transfusion in considerable measurements.
Today one of 12 million people is risked to receive HIV infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood conservations should be distributed before someone was hidden with HIV.
Since Hema- Quebec shares each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood containers, it would take more than 24 years before a case in which HIV was transferred through a blood conservation.
I think that you can feel like this today when you get or write a transfusion to restore the health, it means Hema-Quebec's leader.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to receive the safety of our products.
You never know what disease inhibitors can be achieved in the system.
First in the last year, on the island of Reunion, the Chikungunya-Virus has occurred, which is transferred by insects through the blood, as well as the Westnil virus.
We need to be overlooked, and Dr. Decary continues before she emphasizes that Hema Quebec must also provide sufficient supply next to a secure supply.
'The need is growing because the population is old.
Since cancer combating treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood body or blood places.
The overcome of the population is also affected by the blood surgery, which is only 3% of the people who are able to deal with the blood. '
This allows every healthy person who is 18 or older and meets the pregnancy criteria every 56 days, so six times a year, feeding blood.
In the meantime, 14% of the people who have their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are sick to AIDS or Malaria, and who is in a country that is distributed in the malaria will be excluded for one year from the blood surgery.
'With this 3% we create it to receive an inventor that corresponds to the needs of hospital homes.
The lack of equipment are very rare.
But you must renew the members of this spending network if they are older and no blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to sell blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular spent.
The life is today so hectic that you're finding a rare time to pass a hour at the blood sleeves, Francine Decary regrets.
With a annual budget of $297 million, hema-quebec provides not only blood conservation but also human tissues, including skin transplantates, heart clothes, skins and skins, which are almost used in severe burns.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are interaggregated with Hema-quebec, which also managed the only public nabel skin bank Quebecs.
In the nabel skin, which was previously considered as biomedic waste, there is rich blood that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
'For some weeks, we celebrated the establishment of our thousandst nabel blue tests, and we planned to decrease more than thousand annually.
'We should likely start at the beginning of the next year to make it available for transplantations', says Dr. Decary, which describes this programme of nabel snacking blows as very popular.
'My mothers are convinced to have no access to it' because Hema-quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costful program in all hospital hospitals Quebecs.
Soccer - Impact in halffinal
Monreal Impact last night, thanks to a 3- to 1-size (4 to 3 with all doors) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and decided game of the fourth-final series in the Saputo stadium, where the totality of the mortal relationship was qualified for the half-final round of the divorce games of the first liga of the USL.
The Mediterranean player Antonio Ribeiro took the crucial gate in the nineteen minutes of play.
After a first half-time without door, both for the one and for the other, the media field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other part for Montreals training.
Roger Levesque was the only one who met Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the Pre- and Re-Speak series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a Seattles forecast a 2 to 1 relief.
In half-final, the impact is measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night Thunder was able to evacuate a 3 to 1 defizit in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps moved to the half-final round.
Impact must be held on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly said - Siegetor by Kovalev
The Canadian Manager's Trial is ready to attack the season.
Last night, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Costitsyn launched the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stirm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 seats.
Costitsyn, the star of the meeting, shooted a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev converted a passenger in this win game, the fourth of the three colors into six preparation games.
Kovalev had the victory by shooting the only gate of the whole shoes.
'I'm not still ready, warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel like it."
"He has been too firmed in the first half of the period, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he got the end of the game.
He received a stirmic case. '
Charest placed on the north
The Prime Minister does not close to the elections before the end of the year.
After the General Assembly of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Boldu (Linke) tried to be selected in the current election.
'Move our last large borders in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest, last night with visual resources at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party Quebecs in Levi, presented the entire guidelines.
During his conversation, a kind of image mood was designed behind him.
On three large screens, there were spectacular pictures of water power works, mountain works, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', landcards, etc.
Great resources as during the election period.
With regard to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he will stop the elections of this origin, even if he believed that his terminal calendar was very full.
The ‘Plan North’ is the fourth element of a 'vision' which is appropriate to the Prime Minister for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space', which provides an agreement with France regarding workforces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it was recently mentioned in the talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North, the northern region on the 49th largest level, has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explain why the Northerns ‘a juwel with a huge potential’, but no date, no investment sum or accurate priorities for the future projects.
At least some points of view about what could be done more: especially water energy, forest, but especially in the mountain industry, benefits from the growth of the weak countries and the renewing of public infrastructures.
Accordingly, Mr Charests has the North 'Nickel, Zink, Copper, Platin, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how clear to show that he's looking for a national foundation.
Quebec has grown very much through his connection with the north, he stressed: the street to gold in Abitibi, the Quebec technology, the James Buch.
'It belongs to us, it' is our future', he added after he had placed a theatral pause to look back to the huge map.
The north, 70% of the Quebec region, closed a part of the Labrador, which the Quebec has always required, declared the Prime Minister of Press.
'This is a traditional situation that persecuted all governments.
There is a line where there is no agreement for a long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again in the name of the government."
Furthermore, 'with the climate change we need to remedy our vision from the north,' he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage that will be travelable for the whole year because of the ice shoes.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to place this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the origins and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebecs would be very useful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the kids.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Léturneau (ancient sinist deputy of Hungary) have already conducted negotiations at about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and soil estimates) takes an important place, has included the works.
The Prime Minister does not conclude a great congregation, 'not indeed a assembly', but a opportunity to make a common vision in the 'man'.
The development of the North will, on the other hand, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North Plan will be 'respectived, regulated and environmental', he promised.
Jean Charest describes this 'vision' as if she is a continued manner of the liberal Prime Ministers who were before him.
'When the liberals that were before us, we have thought to convert the challenges to new growth and development changes.
This was also one of the re-educated themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a great cocktail party for the 50th Jubilee of the adoption of the party's leadership by Jean Leage.
One of the decisions adopted provides that Beauharnois' power work in Adelard-Godbot-Stadumm.
"For Godbout, the Hydro Quebec, who has created a read that has reached the peaceful revolution and the existence of water electricity, has always known our party to determine the future," explained Jean Charest.
The press was addressed to another, this time conservative project, a reference to the ‘Roads to the North’ program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest, which is intended for its involvement in 2012.
'These remains among us, but I've intended to be there', he trusted his members, which was rebuilding in those cases.
The Prime Minister, who said in April 2008, and certainly not to give any elections in 2009, has, in fact, the possibility of stopping this original choice, which is possible by the law, not yet excluded.
He stressed, however, that his terminal calendar is full, especially because of a Community Council's mission in China and a glove between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend, the Liberal Party, gave a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitution' objectives that were accepted without any further: the PLQ requires particular recognition of the 'speciality Quebecs' in the Constitution.
It also wants to call Québec members of the Council of Canadian Rundfunks and Telecommunications, and to have a veto regarding the decisions found in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the directions of the North Plan were included with skepsis.
The chief of the Quebecois party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which has introduced the Landry government 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when she came to the power of 2003, refused to apply this.
If she had done it, 'If we'd continue today', Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (which the choice is today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
'What we want is that this is not just a great idea', the Chairman Sebastien Proulx declared in delegation for Mario Dumont, who returns from the holiday today.
letters - A land engaged
Mr Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' Minister (which Ironia) in the Cabinet Harper, was the last summer authorized to tell Louise arbour that she is a 'Schande' for Canada.
This woman who has led to a non-decisive fight for justice and gives all our admiration to discuss with shamach, says so much about the people about the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker itself.
We have to do this here with a government that has not been able to go home as one of all the countries concerned for their country man captured in the concentrations of Guantanamo.
A government that did not even take into account that Omar Khadr was a young man than what happened to him.
The only government, notwithstanding the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, speaks to her words and allows a child soldier to impose it under unhumany conditions.
The only one who is allowed to be a copyright parod to assess the responsibilities of the accused person.
Let us recall that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers to get home to Omar Khadr, so that he gets a fair process in Canada.
The government also solved the eyes before the torture: it is little interesting that a young adult after so many years will be slowly broken forever.
We are not yet conscious of that, but we are just experienced here a home-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-the-leading of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which is constantly like a fahn before us, and that's so unlikely from his mouth.
It is therefore the time in which there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be able to mistreat, torture, and emphasis, completely after the goods of a government head that is supported only by minority until today (this may be totally among minority after October 14...).
Many choosers believe to find their sanctification at a party who preaches angry, law, and order. But they do not see that this government has deceived what the call and the dignity of our country.
The damage, Mr Toews, is in this placement, and nothing else.
Free view - The oral talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Dever published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an oral logic that the world's largest gold profit society was a declaration of over six million against three authors and a small dealing house, with the objective of opening a 'occupied public debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, they are not judged of the truth, especially not in the case of distortions, but in the law.
As I hope that this fundamental difference has been completely disappeared by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to spend everyone into the rule that is looking forward to one of the opposite views.
Like the process, the authors and the employees of the Black Canada book must be extracted in considerable amounts to prepare their defence and struggle with very unreasonable weapons against a army of lawyers who are able to be paid from the nearly unfavourable gold mines.
In other words, the tactics for these unreasonable battles are often to destroy the defenders in order to emphasize an unfair arrangement that makes the side mundtom and also shocks every one who expects to again address the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present its view of the things before the public opinion.
On the contrary to what many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, gangs and ghosts are generally issued in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by smuggling.
It would therefore be sufficient if the gold mines had opened their books and files and had opened a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and the financing of independent test teams, which had been able to bring light into this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in public opinion, and the requests and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a movement.
Maybe Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, and may it not be the views of both this publicity?
It seems to be included in the world of Vice-Presidents only the largely paid lawyers, not the Community of all Canadians; a very nice view of the term.
In a democracy, the democracy has the right to speak of the offenders.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that publicity, which supports the authors and exhibitors of Noir Canada, does this especially because it rejects the brutal situation of gold mines.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many of them come to the crowd (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a call to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they ask for no longer use this term...).
In spite of the surreal speaking by Mr Garver, Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the foundation of the truth, which is essential for each democratic society.
It is fullly right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and discuss the subjects that do not fall to the rich companies of this world, who else can do this then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead this by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment that we belong is known for a long time to get debates and inconsistents into the griff and to solve conflicts.
The unrelated assembly of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what she proposes, there is no joy in a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take steps that limit this kind of unfair cash.
Saving action for the Wall Street - Democratics and Republicans
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, Republic and Democratic Democratics were finally agreed on the largest economic governance plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis that has been threatening the Wall Street for months is still to be adopted by the two Congress Cameras.
The main contents are: a better control of the Members on the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the public-based money, new available available to cover the number of households planned because of payment refunds, and the right to monitor the holders that are paid to the members of the supported companies.
The American Financial Secretariat Henry Paulson, President of the Deputy Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicns, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a second-day negotiation mate.
'We have made great progress in the direction of an agreement that will be effective to the market', explained the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"It was everything to protect the real economy and the American people before the course crisis on the Wall Street," explained the Democratics.
'This is the basic point: if we do not, the trauma, the chaos and the disappointment in the daily life of the Americans,' explained the Republicn Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were accelerated during the last two hours, because of fear of the effects that had renewed astray to stimulate the investors.
The deadline, which was agreed, was the opening of the market today.
The two American presidency candidates, who were late in the negotiations, mostly shown themselves as the favorable of the agreement, but not to condemn them to express their inconsistence in this extreme manner.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements to agree, especially those who should enable the owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the holders of the leading employees of the firms saved by the State.
'If the taxpayer is requested to take the responsibilities of certain persons with extraordinary measures, it is nothing that you might like to be pleased.
But these measures are necessary, and he explained the American television advisers.
When he was asked on another sender whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his republician enemy John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it.
'The guidelines I've read, [seeks] that this is one thing that we all have to be resurrected, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed with the money of the payer
It comes 14 months after a crisis, through the places of a real estate blue, which first leaded to the slaughter of the riskous hypotheks (Subpress) before they extended further forms of more broader shares (PCAA), and finally in a refrigeration of the financial power and in the rule of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Deputy Deputy was to make the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the Democratics have accepted that certain ‘given’ actives of society in circumstance only have to be assured by the government and not to buy, they believe that the sackgase is gone.
In order to decline the vision channel for all in the Congress, it has also been added to availability, which states that if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could then increase new taxes in order to maintain the capital used.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which will be able to go to the other 100 billion if the President is necessary.
The payment of more than 350 billion will be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
On the contrary to its aid, Washington shareholder receives the undertakings supported to him in the case of profitable dividens and who can sell it again when the storm is overlooked.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to keep the installation procedures relating to the accommodations associated with the real estate appropriations concerned by this plan, and also to establish the periods for the repayment and expenditure paid to the employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like to agree on it today, and then the Senate was on midnight.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that her plan will get green light.
Indeed, last night further votes have been made against this project, both from the Republicns and the Democratics.
'Cause Washington does not understand us', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, his electors.
'Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one there is to ask the tax payers to the cash.
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress, which is called 'couch of the Skepticer', represents the things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'For four hundred excellent economic professionals, including three nobel prices, have written us to share us: we ask the conference to not put up on pressure, and to provide carefully the way to be struck,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe we reiterately show that it is a global crisis.
The three Benelux countries announced partly the Statement of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg need, after the French Bank BNP Paribas announced that they would refuse to buy their competitors, which are in great difficulties, since they lost $2,9 billion (2,9 billion) in the crisis by the risks of real estate credit in the United States.
Fortunately, 85,000 people are employed and belongs to the twenty larger European banks and the ten major insurers.
'This is no lost money, explained yesterday by the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Boss.
In compensation, we have an electoral right and an impact on the bank.
This is exactly what the sparors and households are estimated, now when we announce more time. '
During this time, the British government was just on the other side of the channel to register another by the financial crisis.
According to the English Press, the government would take all the current credits to the Bank Bradford and Bringley, with over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate credits.
Last night, the Spanish Bank Santander announced that they would buy the branches and customers of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to be nationalized since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged Icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was a long time his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Have the American players released the charming laugh from the narcist spiegel?
Yes and no.
His feminine feeling, his sensitivity and a clear talent have also maintained him from a power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a great long runner!
Paul Newman, who was killed in Connecticut on Friday at 83 years of age, remains one of the last Icons of the American cine of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was, and for a long time he was a kind of rivale on the Leinwand, more careful in his sighting game, which is also more destructive, but also a apostle of freedom and the spring of dramatric conventions.
The missing blood is often a lot of wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungary mother.
From its European roots, one of the tranquillious faces of the American dream should be found.
Without excessive Ego, extreme quality character.
Because in him, a whole country was reflected again in the self-made-man, in the fighter who was blessed in the Pacific War, who studied the 1950-year show art in Yale and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he succeeded in the theater, television, and soon in China.
Among this man, who fighted for citizens' rights, was also the driver, who was in 1979 at the 24-hour level of Mans II, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the shooter Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this secret, retained, engaged, and against the love of the showbusiness overwhelming stars, which will never be resolved perfectly.
A man in the cleanest sense of the word.
The death Paul Newman's cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while all his major roles were played on the dark screen of the memorys.
More than a century-year-old American film art in a constant change, it's going to be with him.
The charming Cowboy is back from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) in the memory, and the young man who returned his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to the Katze on the warm Blechdach of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will be called a much more shorter memory (1990) that is shocked to his sensible Mr. Bridge, who is stolen in his high age of a marriage that did not all fulfill their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans came through the story.
This criminal, stormical, violent, and incompatible boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full dreck) of Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, after the death was recovered and made the Newman 1956 well known.
This sympathical ganove in the overwhelming The Sting (The Claus), 1973, was excited with the Oscar for the best movie.
As refreshing and smiling Billard players in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Ross (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still.
In his life course, the epoch is connected.
The young man knows him especially from the cult film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of a eishockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a last role 2003, as the patent of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
On the contrary to several cinema leaders who have soon taken away from the film world, Newman should remain in the satellite, and so Hollywood, his possessions, his prunk and his conceptions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Sunderplanding' when he judged his all-expressed performances.
The kitchen was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which flows long-term roles.
However, he played rare sunnyboys as a foreign side: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubts, with the perfect exhibition he reflected his legs and his admiration.
As Governor, Newman enthusiasmed the unknown pages of his true awesome sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (on the Roman of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, signed a pleasant womanport full of melancholie.
He who lost his son Scott through a overdose, this 1984 blew his film Harry and Son, a full work of feing feeling and traurity.
In the flow of foods, who were on the end of Newman, his close friend and former arms, Robert Redford (they were together played in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) were extremely declared: ‘If his presence has improved my life and this country’.
Greatness and life satisfaction were essential features of the deceived player.
Unlike his legendary career, there is now a large defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a rebellion of the abducted Hollywoods.
We have often seen him with the foot in the shoes full of vinaygreat, in sweet, sweet, or other foods, and this holds very sweetly, although we found it even pleasant.
However, the wins from his arrangements were in his foundation for children in emergency.
Instead of smiling on his myth, Newman joined himself to the shoot.
He left his fifty daughters a letter with these verses: 'It and until all, your father was incredibly thankful for his good stars.
It was a honor to be here. '
And for us it was a honour to follow the life of a so intelligent and enormous American player.
An example of citizens, in the closest and slowest sense.
What has been produced in the account manufacture of adject & anmp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Yanos attack and its complications began.
The complaint shall, in particular, prescribe the participation in organized criminality, as well as a largely skilled damage and business abuse, and other criminal acts, including documentation.
According to the State Authority, the funds bound by the registrations were used for their own purposes, while the benefits carried out often have been carried out with false accounts.
State money and subsidies from self-administration - in total HUF 65 million - must be flewed in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, as well as in private boxes.
As noted by the Audit Authorities, in relation to the licensing of the licensing funds, firm accounts were submitted, and the ships should not be complied with their obligations.
According to the appeal certificate, a majority of the accounts should be false.
The account blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefvaros, the round seals were offered in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to be issued was decided on that circle north of the Platte Sea, sent to the Istvan Lados by Yanos.
The Lados Pensions and restaurants should be finished in the trail of this "Incursion Tower".
He requested the consumption accounts to later be able to provide accounts based on these schemes for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Employment and the Budapest's self-administration.
These accounts should, mostly, be manipulated by Istvan Lados and its complexs, András śri, which should have been responsible for the Constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the aims of Lados' "Invasion Tower" was a bierlocal.
As a result of two accounts issued by agression and co in 2003, the Gastronomia Administration is to have dominated the ninety-fifth group of the Convention of Byto Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the chief of the exploitation has found that such a large group had not once agreed to the local.
Another account, issued in the summer 2002 on the Foundation Jobb Jövæért, later known as Egyptian a Harmadik Evezredertt, was also a serious form and content error.
In a pension in Badacsonytomy, which has only three rooms and is not able to hide more than 10 people at the same time, 130 guests should have been maintained.
The fantasy of the account firms was obviously no borders as it went about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomic firm, in which booking documents of the customers Jobb Jövśért and Hoppa, according to the accused authority, appeared.
As the director of business Gyśz Farkas of the hvg.hu informed him, it was immediately clear that it was about false documents when he was submitted by the State Authority during a questionnaire.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrong on the steel."
And further: Unlike form errors, the fact was wrong that the operation had to hide hundreds of people after they had a total of 11 rooms that offer so many people as possible.
It has also been indicated that the restaurant has been in operation for many years.
The account firms have also been deemed to check that the Budapester travel office, which they have taken in their visibility, offers only travels to the foreign country, and thus indicated Hungary travels on the payment account, which also opposed the accounting practice of the company.
As noted in the course of the findings, they have also indicated the amount of taxes on the accounts, although travel offices that relate to a country outside the EU are more valueless.
The amount of the amount of the tax was totally wrong to four of the Hotel Revvoleuxp Kft. at the Foundation of Jobb Jövæt, since the operation was calculated instead of 25% only 15% of WWSt., the employees will also be issued only machine accounts, but they were manually.
Another error in which the "receiver players" was that they had indicated in a case "warn transport" as a performance, although this was not offered by the company specialized on investment consultation, the State Authority shared it.
Additional forms - false account format, false stempel - was to thank that the accounts issued in Egypt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvay, as well as at the XXI. Szazadi Culturalis Egyesület and Byto Pont could be extended as false.
Also, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sporting customer whose business leaders had never been employed.
Another "fake" is the faults at the HIB Kft. from Nyriregyháza: This company is at the time (2001) just in resolution that the Fair Városért Egyesület group had to eat there - the masses manager has therefore argued that the accounts did not have themselves.
Conscious false
The other groups of accounting officers are persons who have been aware of their rational accounts.
At the request of the Faatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvany accounts for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert, in an altitude of about 4 million HUF.
According to the appeal, the director of the Collab Kft was overlooked by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fixed accounts.
The present Biogate also in Liquidation should have worked with appeal and co.: In 2003, the GmbH should have provided the Foundation of Jobb Jövæért Alapítvany, as well as the Vereine Atlasz Egyesület and Vörosfenyâ Egyesület with false accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also little payment movement, since the accounts were immediately shocked after their exhibition, which the interested persons in their documents have been forgotten.
The third group of accounts includes persons who are directly connected to the complaint.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trio Kft., one in Budapest, but it is not found there.
This company is intended to issue a number of accounts on sales of EDV components in the total value of HUF some 18 million.
According to the investigation Authority, the Cash Investment Kft, who is located in Liquidation since 14 September 2005, has functioned as buyer of the accounts from Kiskunhalas.
The director of this company was a Romanian who should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov from 2002 to 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has established accounts in the name of the GmbH. to the Verine Atlasz and Hopaá, as well as to Egyptiütt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány and have seen its opposite value.
The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. should be founded expressly by Roman Maurers on Iván Kubatovs.
However, in fact the company was not active, which was accused of non-employed contracts.
However, he could benefit from the companies: on request of his complications, the lawyer Zsolt Scente, who had been employed with the preparation of the company's base documents, has issued accounts on the blood associated with the attachment, such as Atlasz and Y-Generacio.
In total, Kubatov has 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million in behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linax Trade issued to the organizations.
The State Authority believes that Kubatov could have increased 10% of the account sums and the increased taxation.
Kubatov should even have used the company Szi-Beri Bt. for exhibiting fixed accounts - in this case the accounts have been added to the complaints of Byto Pont.
In January 2006, the Company Y-Generazio and Szövetség a Modernn Magyarerszágenort have issued its applications for the common organization of the Socialist Party, Tacsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both of them received 500,000 fornts, however, these amounts have been used sufficiently.
To make this, they have presented the TMA five flexibility accounts of the Works Team Kft.
In addition, these accounts were assured in the Ministry of Education in the study of the Arpád Kemecsei office.
The negotiations are now calculated by some complaints with an understanding of the procedure of accounting, as they have already been established before the State Authority.
A sense could be if the principal accused Yanos attack is decided to a comprehensive understanding.
In fact, his details were less detailed, and even though he had already been subjected to a number of times to report over everything, his understanding is still outlined.
The question is therefore clear if this is in its interest if socialists have completed a package with respect to the re-advertising of the majority of HUF's 50 million damage, and whether the infringement is ready to take account.
It is possible, however, that the attack plays the "leader" now after his search for mildering of incarceration and house arrest on babies ears.
While other crimes who have been imposed with economic crimes larger damage and have not been injured, on the free foot, or at least under the home prison, this appeal remains the possibility.
The psychology of the transfer - or why we are ready to pay more
The purchaser is intended to pay more and overcome the levy offered therefore.
Neurologs and economic researchers at the university of New York have now been able to discover the neurological-economic basiss of this and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" Magazine, people want to have a competition, such as a decrease on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to investigate the neurological scheme of this "Spiel" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play to Lotto, while others participate in a player action, in both cases the active brain regions of the probands were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In the two games the participants could win money, however, a increased activity of the strict, a complex outside the brain, measured by the loss of the auction, in which the transfer of the enemy played a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-repayment" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that price increase was increased by avoiding a reaction of the strict.
In order to underminute these, the economists in the research group have established further research on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The checking group was informed the real value of the product, then they made their inputs.
Another group was also promised to reward $15 for the case they come out of the game as a winner.
The third group received $15 before the auction, also lost in the case of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between two groups was only that the emphasis on one on the win, while the other were on the loss.
As evidence for the hypothesis expressed by neurologs, the members of the "the losing" group were prepared for higher impact than those in the control group or the "win" group.
"This results are not allowed to react from any previous economic theory.
Indeed, they have found the conducts observed in auctions only with joy of winning or risk prevention.
The resistance between these two theories was resolved by the imaged neurological procedures, so that we have stopped a third statement" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to visit?
Over the world around a half billion people suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is leaked under the leading cause of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated to hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which is often not known that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collection term for different viruses, infectional liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitising and glucose are often, however, different people and diseases are different from each other.
The hepatitis viruses are distributed to two different types: hepatitis A and E through the digestion treatment (e.g. by contaminated food or water), by hepatitis B, C and D, the virus can be transferred via blood and other body liquidities (e.g. sperma, disaster or speculal).
Re travellers will be recommended that a vaccine against the virus A and B is in any case, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two-third weeks after the deterioration of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by disadvantages, weaknesses, skinnesses and breasts.
Then the skin skin is up on the skin and in the eyes, the steel is slight, the urin dark, and the skin can last up to two-third weeks.
Worldwide death of about 1 million people in hepatitis B, larger diseases such as lever cancers and lever cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimations are only every ten infections in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may have severe consequences: untreated can lead to liver cyrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, since the inhibitor destroys the leber cells home - in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years are shown.
It is therefore essential for temporary precautions, such as regular control studies.
There are three groups in which this disease is more often available: those who have been subjected to a blood transfusion before 1991 are depending on drugs and tatouages.
Today the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases worldwide is estimated to 200 million.
Since disease is already evidenceable in a routine laboratory investigation, it is ratifying to visit the home physician at the first signs of unknown origin.
It is timely recognised that the disease is healable, that the virus can be shocked, by using infection treatment and forecast the decrease of cancer.
The 30 September was the World Day of Hepatitis, the first time of patients' treatments in the world was held in 2004.
The goal of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of these viruses, their development and the importance of early recognition.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research results, the religious faith works as a kind of "peace medication", which has already been able to facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the Oxford University have performed an interesting experience: It was investigated how much the faith in God affects the painfulness of humans, reported the British "Telegraph".
In the course of the most strange investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric chocks, while they studied a mix of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers could exclude the majority of the pain.
A brain scan technology could even be demonstrated that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the painful regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, which also participated in philosophies and theologists of various departments of the university.
When the probands tried, a functioning device was connected to the left hand, which shocked the electrical shocks.
The participants were requested to concentrate strongly on two floors: to one image of the mother of God, called by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the young woman of Mary would be called a kind of religious trance under the believers, while they chose the image of the Vincis, because it was little different from the other places and was calm.
The trials carried through a half hours in a MRI scanner, and in this time, 20 electronic chocks were totally in four steps, while they should look at the religious, or the other places.
The Catholics reported that they would feel "in security" at the view of God's mother, as if they were "ensured", and they would have called "sweet and peace".
During the consideration of the religious gentlemen, they reported more than 12% of pain than if they had worked before Leonardo.
Psychologe Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that there could also be similar effects with other, strong images, even with the atheists, to find the corresponding photo.
"We should find a image that solve very positive effects, such as a mother or father," says the psychologue.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practising of faith should change our personality, and also do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these amazing results, only the question of which effect would have a Madonna image Leonardos or another comparable times on the pain regulation of the believers.
Does the quality youth Maria's high-quality results have been achieved?
You're what you're talking about you.
On the basis of her tenth birthday, Google can tell you with flight and right: it's going to find the people's tasks as well as their heads on the sky: you know where people have carried their holidays, to which experts they go, and what they move.
And that's not yet enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business leaders.
In direction of skeptics that are placed by Orwellen Horror visions, he can run: These would only look at the essential web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main objective of Google is to gather more personal information about the users and to draw closer to the original objective of the company, which would like to "all information of this world".
Schmidt explained that Google is still a world changed work after ten years after the beginning of the Information Section.
After the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google would be able to ask questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really takes to me?", however, the software programs are not yet possible because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are clear that the search terms would be registered in the way of their Internet research, as well as IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visiting pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search event and later to make it possible to generate a lot more accurate later, and also based on the same logic the "recommendations" mentioned as the system recommended by the previous preferences.
The users, however, ask what happens in the case of a miscarriage - "If you see what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopols.
In most cases, however, it is more likely to be the potential power represented by the company that fears, and less the debt feel or fear of punishment, striking by freedom or restraint against the power that causes distortion in many Internet users.
However, it is a fact that the terms of search are not only stored but also forwarded to third parties, and there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet users in these cases.
A parade game for this was soon the action against paedofilia in Brazil, in the Google Go of the Brazilian government, which was collected by the Community site named "Orccus" and also allowed the identification of paedofils.
In order to take care of personal rights, however, users could still be able to investigate when Google was successful with the EFF Civil Rights Organization towards the Court of Justice. In the future, Google can also be able to provide information to the FBI on secret requests.
(But the federal government has successfully carried out the production of 50,000 web addresses and 1.000 search terms in reference to the last year adopted youth protection law, but it has been maintained the list of individual users with regard to their website and search lists for two months.)
Google's image is therefore reversed: those who do not disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimity fairs by using the Google Services.
Independently, the American "Geek culture", which is presented in many countries and engages enthusiasmed computer fans, activeists and users, which are the next generation of "cooled entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, who is the leader of Windows markets, even though both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users in contrast to Microsoft, and its services are freely available, so that a open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software guiding.
On the other hand, geeks consider the problemtic relationship of personal rights and the Internet measuring - a relationship, especially in the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In fact, "Web 2.0" is nothing else than to cooperate, speaking, allowing users to use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main case remains the same as the public.
A average youth can be managed at several Community ports - from Facebook via Xanga, this can be connected to other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and all of this can be connected to a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can also connect blogs that are automatically designed by the latest photo galleries on Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other spectacular cases indicates: In view of the party photos of the last night, the friend's friends find out soon with whom her unloved friends have enjoyed, or the employee will be left, because he only makes his wrongs honestly about the company management air - one is safe: the term "Privatsphare" has been generally re-interpreted.
The one who leads a online life is what he presumes from himself - so in almost the fundamental ideas could be formulated behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to run the Google monopole, it can be like to do - such as with scroogle, a tool that is accepting Google's search machine, but it doesn't leave any shoes.
Not few people do not register on Community pages so they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are not connected to large server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile by the user.
The public's view is in the meantime expected until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising surfaces of Adwords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertising agencies, and the services that are always more rapidly introduced are not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical observers also found the threatening opposition: so the concert has declined a protest of employees since the costs of the strong child garden was doubled, and also the management of the several times of the employee's infringement, but it was quite sweet that Google went to China even before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with a agreement, which would be filtered against the good machine.
The internal arrangement of the concert states that no new service will be used before, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the next months and years could be re-enhanced: while some say that Googles book and magazinscan or archiving project takes more detailed extents that the company should immediately interfere with the Supreme Court, so others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which makes a complete health profile on the basis of funding, drugs and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors provides the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in the best oral manner a future where a person is close to fearing data thanks to Google.
Two Youths help the double killer of Ozd at the cutting
With regard to the double murder of Ozd, the police has now heard two young people who are suspected to have helped with the elimination of the springs, shared the speaker of the police Commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The adolescents were continuously accused of the aid at the time.
According to the reporting Agence MTI, two girls are defending themselves freely.
aid is threatened by a punishment of up to five years.
The suspecter of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old ortsacher man, was taken into investigation on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent suspect of murdering several persons of money.
In the course of the investigation, the 23-year-old debt of a 53-year-old year had been more money.
However, the suspecter did not want to compare his debts, so he locked his fellow believers on the midday afternoon on a floor in Oced where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the fact of a long hand - this also proves that he began murdering with a gun hidden on the assault.
With the experts, the police now investigates the real weapons and the conditions of its use.
Warschauer Börse is shopping boot for Prager Börse
Rund 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech chronic crowns offered the warschaur Burse for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prayer Börse.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that the Poland had made, despite the fact, that they were formerly excluded from the Czech than possible owners of their bridges.
It is reasonable that the warrior Börse is fully listening to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Poland State, but more than 60% of the papers in the next months.
After reports of the Czech day period "E15", the offers of Poland include the highest purchase price that has been offered for the Prayer Burse.
As reported in the newspaper, the Vienna Börse, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Burse and the German Burse offers.
Petr Koblic, Head of the Prayer Börse, said that all interested persons would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not also conclude that this could even lead to the closure of the speaker Börse in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the player Börse at 5-10 billion chronicles.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Börse is the Patricia Finance Investment Bank with a 25% participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
Financial crisis from European newspapers
In their comments on the continued international financial crisis, some European leading letters have already been speaking on Tuesday, "around 11 September".
The global financial disaster has been grateful to the American President, said about "La Republic" - the President has never ever been able to make its own Party for the draft legislation towards one who should bring some lifting into the detrimental situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliardous investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more attractive to speak of a "earthly 11 September".
parts of the press in Madrid also run the sinbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is debt that the world economy is now at the random of the convergence.
The American Financial System is still more threatening to combine, including the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after the vote in the Congress, it threatens the risk that Washington has not stopped political resources for crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just as one of the greatest transformations of capitalism.
You can't leave the threat more than eight, which means about the gene "day displayer".
However, some States could also provide their currency-related cash-institutes, and the banks save the money of the taxpayers before the bank.
However, if a domino effect will be solved and more banks are going, nor other financial fundings, nor other emergency measures.
Long-term EU Member States should be shocked over their shadows and centralize monetary market controls.
On Monday, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weak money institutions, the Wiener "Standard". Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that the European taxpayers should take something deeply in their duty to get out of the crisis after the Americans.
At the time, the EU has not severely seen with the crisis, which now comes as a tsunami over the old continents.
The "reserve" should not immediately with several hundred billion euros "weeds", but it would be slightly to maintain awareness wherever it would be convenient to add the money of the taxpayers in order to reduce even more damage.
Intelligent car imits the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not implanting obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the beasts.
A surprising project in Japan was presented in which Nissan Engineering of Hummels was inspired in the creation of new accidental systems.
In cooperation with the Tokiote University, Nissan has built the controlled biomimetic system of the BR23C type, equipped with the properties of the beasts to support the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, every beer is very similar to our own "Privat area", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The assembled eye of the beasts, which can see in each direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To follow the function of the assembled eye, the researchers pointed out the idea of the large controlled distance weather.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a area of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their removal and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board that immediately introduces the collective prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in second burns, and the author booster immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the beasts, turning the rifle around the corresponding angle.
On the contrary to existing systems, this manual is instinct.
"If it wasn't so, the author could not react enoughly to avoid obstacles", Tushiyuki Andoh, director of the "Moability Laboratory" and the authorboat projects.
The system must be instinct and immediately reacting, since this technology corresponds to the most internal and pollutable part of the protection gap - a speed that is still inevitable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the beasts when they escape other bees.
And that's got to end up in the brain of a second.
However, the exhibition, in contrast to the beasts, can not go down, down, or diagonal - it can only be twodimensional, but only in direction of the vulnerability of the rifs.
While the bees are infinitely open here, many possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers could only be used to the author shop with the driving movement, as regards the speed and debris.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy efficiency, and therefore have a longer life period than coherent lithium ionium batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinct, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of data, and less on the ability to save it.
This device should be processed only for seconds and reacted accordingly to them.
It must not save this or produce an intuitive, logical reaction through previous manuscripts so that it takes a handful KB memory in access.
No gigabytes and megabytes memorys need.
This is the first step in developing immediate collision prevention technology that will be severely in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation by conscious of the driver of obstacles and leading it to the target.
A name for the secondary kid
Now the written version of the 700-mrd-dollar severe saving package, which will be applied in several steps and aimed at the purchase of the bad credits of the banks.
The first step is to be issued by half of the money.
At a meeting, which ended on Saturday after midnight in East Coast, the Congress Members were reported to an agreement on the 700 billion dollars serious relief package.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American Deputy House, and said that we should only put the agreement to paper.
The achieved compromise on the saving package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the program will show effects and it will be effective to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the saving of the Wall Street, but because of this, the routine of the economy.
The written version of the package has been published before the Asian markets were opened, i.e. Washington Times Tuesday 8 p.m. (Myday Monday, 2 p.m.), but no high flight was removed to the Börsen.
On Monday, the Deputy's Budget on the draft legislation on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke on the afternoon with Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme depends on the original recommendation of the Bush administration, which $700 billion should be issued once more fauler for the purchase, with creditors.
In a first tranche, the maximum half of the 700-millionary allocations should be issued, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday. This sum is to be used for the purchase of credited, bad value papers, and the other 100 billion USD will decide the President.
The programme is reviewed by a own Commission, which also listens to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combinated tactic: it can also buy bad credits, hypotheks, and value papers covered with hypotheses, or other "government" credits.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase may be carried out directly and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the caregiving resources, and the companies pay the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources that can be provided as an immediate aid for the American Financial System, if it is for the largest purchase of bad resources, its insurance or for the avoidance of a system risk that is removed by the colleagues of a greater money institution.
We set the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law when it was signed, Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty, which are now designated to public aid, may be acknowledged that their deferences called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas are shortened by the government.
A decrease of the holder will only be given in certain cases, and these burdens will be decreased from how the Ministry of Finance will help each other.
The currency means that if the Ministry purchases an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the extended banking chief is cut into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of false credit, the government will be aggressively engaged in order to ensure that the managers are not transferred.
The image is also that the existing Golden Handshake treaties will not be amended - the restrictions refer only to new agreements to engage more people in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that torments are regulated by law by managers, commented by the Democracy Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State will win the shared banks, so that the risk for the taxpayers can also be participated when the economy is better and the saved bank will be better.
The draft legislation proposes that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years how taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides, skepticers, who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does no case protect the money of taxpayers, as the Californian Republic Darrell Issa.
His colleagues from Ohio, Mary Captur said: The measures were made by the same persons who are also responsible for the Wall Street colleagues.

Barack Obama and John McCain, the two Presidential candidates of the great American Party, have supported a serious saving package for $700 billion on Sunday.
The Congress and representatives of the Government have announced the day after Marathon's discussions that they have come to an agreement on the bank salvation package.
The crisis of the Wall Street, as well as the relief of the frozen credit market, was on the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both said to be better than the enemy to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent investigations, Obama was able to continue to build the economic topics, while McCains Hoch, who has decided to represent the Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republic of the Convention, has also been schools.
On a election campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will take rapidly a serious package of $700 billion.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passengers of consumer protection which he has supported.
"We have to act now, as responsible (...) - your jobs, your departures, all industry, and the stability of the whole economy is threatened," he said 35,000 observers.
He didn't want to call McCains' economic visions as "obsolet".

Press view of the German language space
The right castle is intact, only the electioners have been in the layer of self-consciousness - so comments "The Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to register to prevent a red-warm coalition.
The skin (spiegel.de)
In the online output of the German news machine set on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic CSU relief in its article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their parents".
According to the named polytologs, the CSU's erosion began long before the tragic Beckstein Huber Duo overcome his officers.
Christians have renewed battlers over decades - now the modern citizens are just out of them.
The Epochenbruch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU was not surprising but the Sunday has ended something, but it was already signed about ten years ago: the uncertain hegemony of a State party.
Because 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU was at 47.7% and the first time since the fifty-year-old market was divided into the fifty percentage market.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Federal Day, so that in the many quoted stoiber-ans.
The consequent modernization by the Federal CSU has finally destroyed its own mothers and parents.
Sociologs have already prognosed this 40 years ago, but at the time it was significantly estimated, but without effect, the secularization, the results of education, the shift of Eastern and Northern German in the prosperous regions of Bayerns could not remain to the faithfulness of the CSU electors.
Modernization is always in line with optional reduction, and it has political implications.
The right castle is intact - only the choices within the castle were critical and volunteer.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks the classic citizen groups just expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professionals, the commercial citizenship and the elections, such as high-school.
The support of the CSU was not less than 40% here.
Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Participants continue in coalition questions" article on the chaotic internal policy in Austria after the new choice.
The SPUE wants to be negotiated with the OPP.
The EBP shall prohibit the injection of the SPUE in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open for conversation in all directions, while the greens are still not intended to determine coalition.
The new choices are over, and now everything turns to the coalition; in the debates in the public-wealth television, the parties were not looking at their cards.
SPÓ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate the EVP.
The SPUE wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is very well - in some federal countries and in the social partnership is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, who is currently the head of the AVP as a vicecanzer, left Faymann.
As he said, the electors had chosen the shooter currency.
Repeating this direction does not matter.
Molterer reacted carefully on red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, but he said, if Faymann tried to be in the internal concerns of the AVP.
Whether his party is opposed, or coalition, is currently fully open, and these questions should be discussed within the EVP.
BZÃ-Cherf Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-free, we are ready to take government responsibilities", says Haider.
Yaroka: Devil cycle of poverty and segregation must be interrupted
Today, in Paris, the European Summit has started the equality of opportunities, which will be directed by the EU-Race Presidency France.
Livia Yaroka, Fidez-Chairpersons of the European People's Party, particularly on the education segregation, noted that one of the most seriously violations of the law is the contrary to the Romans, even if this is the greatest obstacle to their implementation needs.
The high-ranging conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Xavier, on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, the EU Commission for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legislative and citizens organizations in the field of equality.
As reported by the press office of the EP's Fidesz, Yaroka highlighted that further discrimination in the job search, the Rome would, firstly because of its low level of education from the labour market.
"The overwhelming majority of the Roman youth has no secondary education, and only a small part of them can reach a high school."
Jaroka further emphasized that education is a fundamental human rights, which is a key role in implementing other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Romans could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The Members believe that this association is important to be conscious of a larger circle, such as Rome and non-Roma.
Because before a Roman student begins the school to increase its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income and transfer taxes, they contribute to national expenditure.
"If Union citizens, the Roma must be ensured the right to high quality education - the bad and secretary education should be set", says Livia Yaroka.
As the Member stated, a common, objective and negotiative action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the education process, which is essentially the right compliance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We have to break the devil cry of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and the Romans give the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Japan.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the Summit will be launched with the objective of a unique forum for the predetermination of the objectives of equalness and discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: Gnade on time
The end of October will be decided through the shift of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein
In spite of the election balls, no heads have been cut off, and the personal debates were dealt with in the sight of the Bayeric CSU.
Participant Erwin Huber and Minister Beckstein remain in their officers, the question is only how long this grace is given.
On the switch rate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percentage stimulation losses will be decided at the extraordinary party in October last weekend.
However, the so-called Duo has already seen that it would not want to clothe on their seeds.
In this way, they would like to join the enhanced group and the party's base, which one day after the "bayerian Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Before five years ago, Edmund Stoiber, who was in the career higher point, reached 60.7% of the Christian Social Union, but now only 43.4% of the votes were able to secure.
The CSU was 46 years old in Bayern, which produced 18% of the German BIP.
While the conservatives remain the determinant power in which the Southern Federation, also important for the Hungarian economy, will continue to be registered in a coalition future.
As the first sign of the participating restructuring, the potential follower Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seahofer will also be bound to the team of expertise, which leads to the liberal FDP, in relation to the legal "Free Electioner" discussions on a possible monkey coalition.
One ironi of the shock hall is the same that with the list "Free Electors" that Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislation that the anti-stairs have first used the Huber-beckstein Duo to keep the targeted politicians ungodly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Staiber, who has taken the floors out of the background, has become an active role: the former Prime Minister and the CSU President called the "the last day of his political routes".
In Monday, Huber made a few gifting comments in the direction of the D.D.D.D.D. - his views would have made the CSU more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the distortion as a signal to the CDD and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also has contributed to a lot of success at the national level 2005, will not be re-organized with a common power attack, Merkel may not be a candidate after the Federal Days election in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heal from its distortion over the Fiasko, believes that the earthly loss of the CSU will not affect the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the damaged CSU will not be easier to register, and the crisis of social democracy continues.
With 18.6 per cent, SPD has reached its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukacenko Opposition: 110-0
The elections on Sunday have not done the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
The Russian observers believe that this is the well-being and stability of the country carried out by Alexander Lukachenko, but the OECD constitutes legislative laws in the statement of the votes.
The OECD, sent from 43 countries 450 observers, has not recognized the elections.
The legislation of the 10 billion inhabitant State has been not opposed for decades, but the counterparty, in the name of the "Related Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seen seriously expected that Lukahenko, who would be renewed at the electoral elections and by a Constitutional amendment of 2006, would be the fourth time that some members of the Opposition in the Parliament would "allow".
The ODS has therefore taken away from the previously planned boycoat.
Ukrainian will be more economicly depending on the increased prices in the earthquake import of Russia. In the context of the expectations of the opposition, Ukraine hoped to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukazenko and other high-border political systems because of the anti-democratic systems in the EU.
For an interim dispatch, the evaluation report of the OECD elections was concerned, in which the attention was higher on the positive movements, instead of the density, as well as the resolution of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections.
However, the rapid report of the OECD was already criticized by the campaign - which would not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition to votes was not present.
Despite all the oppositions, a defence in the political system was recognised: political prisoners have been placed at almost free foot, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing recognition of the independence of the African provinces of South-Oceans and Abachatia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on the paper, has been regarded as an independent state since a month.
"We have made two steps before and a back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between the white and EU has started", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our paper.
In view of the opposition candidate of the 2006 Presidency election, it is a wish to continue, although "the Powers have feared, but only to leave a opposition in Parliament."
The opposition does not plant protection measures in view of the results, but it is best to make the need for an economic reform clearly the choices.
"We have been fighting with many problems - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities have put us into the way when they are shocking stones, but I see that more people are supporting the changes, even older people," said Milinkewitch in remarking that the most supported stage of pensionists with the Lukachenko regime is not once agreed with the only service which is the production of social security.
"Thank the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit is only a question of time until the "social security" in the style of a Friedhof begins", says Milinkewitsch.
On the contrary to opposition policy, Russian observers have called elections as a democratic.
Sergej Lebetev, Chief of the Mission of the Community Independent States, explained the news Agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a evidence for the routine of the White Electors.
Brunetta: "It's been broken before the work."
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are turnable doors for the employees' departments.
From today, the measures will be taken into force against those slammers who are first shut up and then go to coffee drinks during the worktime.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Session" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministerial Council.
">" Treasurable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new time of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta repeats again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the introduction ends in all buildings of the presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi here means: "The choice of the turnable door is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officers, assured the Secretary-General: "This process was supported by all of them, the cooperation came from all sides."
There is no breakfast now for the worktime; finally with coffee or Creenti.
Brunetta is in this regard with a laugh: "A good cappuccino works at 7:00."
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Summit School of Public Administration)
The minister announces that “in three months the deficiencies of officials have reduced by 50%, which means 60,000 people per year are present in the work”.
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"There loan dynamics - so the Minister - were doubled in the last 8-10 years as the private area and far beyond the inflation rate."
Thousands of officials have joined themselves in order to work on the Brunetta Decree in the context of the supported professionals by Codacons.
"After the Minister for Public Service is profiled by numbers of lower debts in the work - this writes the consumer centre - increases the people of the 'actived folks'.
Indeed, thousands have met correct and valuable officials of the public service in order to explain the contrary standards of the Decree."
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is struggled for additional financial compensation for working disease; the planned expansion of the forced house arrest of the hospital workers, whereby control visits and other aspects of the renewing of the minister is possible.
Napolitano: "Prevention against labour accidents is crucial"
Each day, in Italy, 2500 job accidents, three people die and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007, the Inail's data (National Institute against Labour Diseases) is confirmed that the death accidents were at about 1200.
These paragraphs indicate the reality of a phenomenon, which almost doubles so many death accidents that were caused by murder.
Today, the hamil (Association National Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all provinces of Italy, the 58th national day for the victim of labour accidents, so that the attention of the social institutions and media is to this dramatic situation.
"The concerning leaders, the data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days, as the question of prevention is crucial in the workplace, confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Office (National Mutilati and Invalidi of Work) Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "a great appreciation for the continuing commitment to prevent jobs, to protect the lost workers, to assist the families of victims and to sensitify public opinion".
"A recommended "Basta" has taken place; of course, in tragedies, which, in measuring their size order, solve some mixtures in the media and the share of the public. However, the everyday reality is often faced with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamic."
Napolitano does not reject "a resource problem in any case: it must be invested in education and information."
A particular importance is to be taken by young people who are closer to the work world by many initiatives towards direct consciousness in school frame.
It is our obligation to give attention to this phenomenon and not to decline from its social repercussion. We must put into force and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini emphasized "as the phenomenon of labour cases forms a urgent social emergency, which is the conscience of all of us and imposes all institutions to work on a decision-making rules which aimed to end the problem."
"The data of work accidents seem to be a light improvement, but this does not conclude that the number of labour cases is too high", emphasizes the President of the Emil, Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want that this "positive tendency" means less attention, so that causes the tragedy at the end. "
"Why believe that you are understood on the basis too little to reach the phenomenon of accidents, but you can fight by different actions.
Strengthen controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli, but also more measures to clarify workers who are already starting in school."
"Another effort is needed - so it adds - what is the communication and the sensibilization of the public opinion.
But above all, it is a greater responsibility feeling of the workers' sides of a phenomenon that is a social accident."
Mercandelli was also talking about "the continued deterioration of the protection of labour accidents" and proposed the "decreation of the social system, which we fight in the past years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the employee a guarantee to ensure that the sacrifice of a labour accident is not dependent on voluntary or accidental costs that are decided for time by a lawyer."
Mp3 player under charge: Risk of hearing damage
To hear music over a longer period with tragable music devices, such as Mp3-players, can lead to permanent hearing damages.
This reports the European Commission, which is quoted by the EU’s opinion of Csserri (the Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks).
"The report – as a result, it is clear that 5-10% of those who have at least five years for a week than one hour of music with tragable music devices are risking the sustainable loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of youths, normally tragable music devices and phones, make their ears to a high volume power, without knowing it unreasonablely", says Meglena Kuneva.
"And the scientific ideas – so it is called by the euro – shows a clear risk that causes too fast trafficking.
What really means is to sensibilise consumers and to make these information about measuring.
In view of these scientific expertise, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep the new technology step."
Brussels, the independent scientific committee had been employed by young people in view of the distributed use of the tragable music devices.
"The scientists - so confirms the EU's communication - that they are too concerned and that the European Commission will now be investigating the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents from traceable music devices and similar devices. "
There is already a European standard that limits the level of swimming music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damages that could come from a too large load of equipment.
This damage can be extremely limited, in which solutions such as reduction of the volume and length of the vision.
In their report, the EU Scientific Committee pointed out that if the users of tragable music devices heard only five hours the week (as far as 89 decibel) music, so that the legal borders are already exceeded, which are applicable to the maximum equipment level at the workplace.
Those who exceed these borders risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated between 2,5 and 10 million people in the euro.
Rome, Germany provides the Commission for the future of the capital.
We're going to start today, in March, the balance will be taken in June.
This is the end of the work of the "Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome", which was set by Capitol, and the Commission has taken place today in the new seat behind the Caracalla themes.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
When the project is completed, the Council will evaluate the analysis and projects to be able to propose the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official Steel" of Capitol and Supreme Citizens Gianni Alemão.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are present in her", emphasizes Germania. "The Commission will provide proposals for a Roma development plan which remains politically responsible for the City and the Council.
There is no new distribution of responsibilities, just the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve, since such projects need to have a timely endpoint.
In June, as the Supreme Citizens announces, we will present the strategic plan we will use the work done by the Commission."
The Commission's competence in question, since the view of its responsibilities, replied German: "All of them are the work that the Commission will provide and depend on the quality of their proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides qualitative results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is often employed with the daily problems and emergency that are at time.
However, we want to have a longer period to work seriously in a deep perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Supreme Citizens Rome is worth expressing the following: "This Commission is no useless institution, nor a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens, and it will make us think of it. It will take the best head of the capital city."
According to Alemão, "It is necessary to have a strategic plan that is not hermetically or statistically to allow our city to make a quality speed - which she really needs, and so to make a common step in the future."
A future, as the Supreme Citizens Rome, which "do not only be limited to the existing communal borders but is much further seen," is not only about the role of Rome as a metropole and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician, who is very independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who was decimalized by his decisions, the economy of the United States, and who took up with the defended Islamic relations (which is still doing this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama will always be stronger, right now where the choices are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very fresh: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation which has seen in total two black governances and five black senators!".
In fact, however, these attacks have no lot to say; it is about racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the electors: will he be a good President? And then there are the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a great shock.
There are also people who are talking to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in their editorials: Only in the election box, we will be sure we will know who the real American patriote will give his voice.
There is an intelligence of the United States that has been hidden until last.
"Cause what you want, then we will decide to make our curves, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we're going to emigr from America.
What you never heard before – just now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these views, the final weapons for the Democratics is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error has Bush started during his office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a trit to the hills.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, the Iraqi remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who is taken his place is before a huge task.
U.S. Financial Summit also posted his scenarios at journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the cuttings. And many accused the Internet, the "Promotor" of the press.
Fifty hundred American journalists were asked about the future by PEW Research Center on their situation and their mental controls.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistly about their future.
However, they did not really care for the information regarding competents for the general credibility.
They don't feel alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems caused by the newsroom, such as the area in which the editors work in order to collect the newspaper.
This is a problem that must be solved – such as the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, is not significant.
A clear, but complicated pessimism is today complied with the American journalist.
Six from ten journalists and executive seniors of the press are the view that journalism is on national level in the wrong way.
In the local area, the executives are even 65 %.
Printed by Mr Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine what direction the web is.
The most important segment groups are the way towards the Internet, which is viewed by many than the " killer" of the press press.
The "economic pressure", which the journalists feel, has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have given themselves to join the new technology, in the hope "he brings something good for journalism."
The biggest risk is in the American journalism today between the heads of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chiefs at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it's to do with the "security in the work."
The operational leaders who fear to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30 %.
The theme of the "safe work" in the team (insered "editers", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists are working under the contract.
In a huge country, as it are the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of magazines, magazines, radio and television senders and Internet suppliers, the employees offer how it is popular to them, so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The boost providers receive very often very high wages, but the editor can only receive 10000 euros per month, so relief and insurance payers.
As regards the holiday, the thing will be complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to reach a certain number of years of holiday.
But the American journalists will become, as they themselves give themselves, often "health".
It is a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT ON GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to derogate the request of the real estatemaker, which was requested to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It shall be identified against Coppola for bankrot in the context of the investigation on contractual agreement in the case of the transfer of the Unipol bank.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted to a residence duty in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested to allow the real estatemaker to be allowed from the province in a apartment in the capital city.
According to the Court, the court could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain a complainant evidence on him.
Elite is in danger
The phenomena had been revealed just a few days ago when the deputy chamber against the 700 billion Dollar Sparpacket of the White House was true: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in saving the Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the strict issue of the New York Times, which reports about how the crisis in the course of the Republicn party is overall, which is increasingly disadvantaged in its old and moderate East Coast Seal, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and the "neoconservatives" in Washington and the financial world, and wins in the south and in the centre of the States.
This part of the Party thanks the vote I mentioned above.
This so-called example is only a small part of the major changes that are announced or even already represented by the current economic earthquake: not only in the United States, also in the whole west, and may also be affected beyond this.
Even in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-term feared events that are finally accepting and lighting under these new conditions.
The first phenomenon is the re-detection, the unreasoned renaissance of the State in connection with a type of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of bank and financial institutions that have close links to the foreign and managed an unexpected amount of property of private households living in a single State.
This means a direct political problem for governments, namely how to be treated against the families concerned, which are also a huge choice mass.
As a result, the crisis seems to be economically global, however politically, it is almost pure national.
The internationalism seems to be inseparable and have lost his right to speak: the illuminating evidence for this is given by the EU which will not find a common way because of its division in various national and international conflicts.
This is why all with the inclusion of the own State; saving plans, new rules, e.g. the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has always been more seriously, the United States are only to save themselves in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimation to use these: therefore, two conditions not exceeding, under certain circumstances, which may not be able to reduce international organization and no market in a similar manner.
The new impression, which is put on the State-National element, is, on the other hand, perfectly in line with the increasing importance in the economy recently linked to a closer sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer way is now when we were so convinced of being involved in a devastated global rich, in a kingdom of the always differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we need to see once, how our future will depend more from the essential material things: water, reward and oil.
Though all of them can certainly be transported from one place to the other part of the world, they are extremely associated with a closely registered part of the earth – a territorial.
For this reason, the person who has such a territory is in the advantage of living in an unprecedented, unconscious, waterless or oil conditioning area.
I am now coming to the second news, but I am putting a short complaint.
Whoever Territorium, whose government, who says policy, says also the Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergent phenomena.
On the other hand, there is the knowledge of the need for guidelines, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of the detection on the existing guides, e.g. those of the economy, which have been disappointed as an inadequate and full shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeply richer and in a certain sense of anxiety: a loss of confidence, an inaliency, a image of inconsistence, a feeling of the television, which is all a class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be the path of the conviction under major parts of the people that it is not only the acts of the social elite, but already their ideas, the Way of Life, its culture in the slightest sense of the word, which is the content of the majority as always foreign and convenient.
The question of Leadership is therefore closed to a devastated but powerful movement of the leading class and the coherent political stability. This is shown in unforeseen "Revoltes" of the electioners and in the unreasonable revolvement of the collective state of the last time: starting with the resurrection of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the recovery of the working party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American Deputy against Bush (you may also play a role here).
The impression of the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their guides, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, the increasing understanding problems and therefore less representative in terms of what happens today in the lower social dimension of the West and is still strengthened by the financial crisis, and it will be divided up to the overdimensionality.
In view of all that it would be easy to speak of a "rebellion of the mass".
But to keep the eyes open, it is not sure.
The super clothes that can get up on the wall
The forces of the weakness are able to swim through a tube and to be able to swallow the walls like Superman.
This is the scope of four American research centres which are likely to be started by the objective.
With an area of only 2,5 qcm, it has reached the researchers to fix a 100 kg serious body on a right wall.
STUDIO, a American magazine, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material created by the research team is a further development of the materials already used, which uses a special carbon structure, called carbon nano-roadrics.
"The principle of the clergy can be presented as a series of races to a stapel Spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have allowed to inspire the feet of the shoes, which are covered by microscopic skins that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glas Teflon and Schilling papers have shown that the new clob is ten times stronger than the strength of the feet of the reptiles and the "will remove unfairly from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering Sciences.
AN MAUERN INGLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as an adventured clothing", adds Liming Dai.
What can be done to bring Spiderman to walls? Maybe the researchers think about a less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nano-redrics are also leading to warm and electricity.
Additional application areas could fall in the area of space.
The superhelds have to wait for the moment.
Another ART OF FORCTION – also the University of Berkeley, California, is a new type of kitchen.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers present a kitchen from microfashers that cleans themselves as hairs by movement on a surface itself from the steel, and thus maintains a perfect debt.
Medicine: never take with fruit saft
Carefulness for Grapefruit, Orange and Applesaft.
These drinks that are consumed as a result of their frustrating quality and their vitamin riches, e.g. in summer, may cause severe health damage if they are taken in comparison with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the inclusion of this by the body in extreme way.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, reiterates the risk packed as well as fresh fruit seeds in connection with the medical injury. In the context of 236. Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reiterates the alarm: A glass of apple, persons or grape fruit is sufficient to reduce the ability of certain life-related medicines so far that the health of patients will be eliminated and that the health of patients will be threatened.
Grapefruitsaft was already suspected to be responsible for increaseing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiac cycle, anxiolytic and neurological means, up to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTS IN GEFAHR – This medicine Agency had been warned in a report two years ago by physicians and patients before the risks of this mix, and emphasizes what will be taken in connection with the means such as diazepan or metabolism.
ES IST NICHT NUR GRAPEFRUIT – according to the experts also contain individuals and applesaft substances that may be able to cut the medicines.
The list of active substances covered by the seventh fruit is long.
As a result, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the University Statale di Milano: "That results are generally delivered immediately to the various international manufacturers, which are so free to change consumer information.
It is therefore recommended to always read the packaging table and, if there are incertitudes to have no shoes to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," stressed the experts of the Ansa Agency.
Economic prices takes place to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the involvement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neokeynesian who teaches to the University of Princeton and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush Administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the appeal of 11 September 2001, during the day of Enron's Summit, Krugman had stated that this second event was more important for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that is not a little Polymetic response and has been preserved for the economist for years later, but today it is very correct.
"I'm surprised and also shocked about how fast the memory of the scandals have been lost in the context of Enron or Worldcom's public view field", explained end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also a analyzer with a "severe aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government".
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" packages
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0; the Open Source Software has won as a free substitute for Microsofts Office, a larger number of users, both at home and in the office, as well as among freezers and public administration.
After a year more intensive work by voluntary developers that are watched by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now dispattanized initial menu, the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2. format is finally one of the reasons for guaranteed compatibility with the Apples operating system Mac OS x and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is also the new standard ISO version.
Eight opposed to the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, which can be read by OpenOffice new formats (.douch, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, there are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easy to send through email. This includes importing PDF files in graphic editing modules and also save the original appearance of the page.
This allows us to generate "hybride" PDF files that extend the typical graphic of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be edited more and more by different users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will provide a frame to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some enterprises are just to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is to be published.
The Italian version is available to download the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html. So follows the English version that is located since Friday on the monitors.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the operating system Linux.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
If the expense freedom can be encouraged to distribute the program in the private budget, it is just in the area of the business where OpenOffice could be able to provide a large importance: finally, various institutions of the public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
Indeed, it is not even lacking a training offer, which means optimal assistance for smaller and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens business perspectives.
OpenOffice is part of five main file components: Writer, the word corresponding text configuration program; Calc, the table program aimed at extra extra; Impress to produce presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of data databases instead of the known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily overcome by 3 million and 600 thousands already reached.
Coal also tests positively and thus the fourth double case
It opens a new Doping Case in the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian Sporter Bernhard Kohl of the Team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classified and winner of the Tricot of the best clients.
The news published the daily newspaper L' Team on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, which was positively tested at Cera, the epo of the third generation. Before it was already found at the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood tests of carbon consists of those operated in the last weeks of the Losanna and Chatenay-malabry laboratories.
Confirmate the positive results of Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded for two years.
The chief of the French antidoping committee Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epothesis, and reported as the Associated Press also the Austrian officials.
The 26-year-old Austrians increased behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best client for themselves.
THE MAY: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: ITALIAN CONSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of immigrants has become one of the favorite countries for immigrants" which are only inclined to oppose.
Make this from the Belgian country a country of racists? This asked the New York Times in a long article, which is the subject of racism in Italy, and is the case of the young, Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was killed a month ago in Mayland.
The case comes from what the Times called "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and employment opportunities" is, however, "the highest degree of anti-immigrational sensations and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing shock between Italians and immigrants, the Times uses further episodes of intolerance from Mayland, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and the rapid exhibition of illegal immigrants is also identified as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also stated by the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Cyril for cooperation between the church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-euro per room high prices
The market for accommodations for students does not know any crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the Middle workshop, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Mayland, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trends, and the whole weight of students loses their right to study as their families are not able to support them in this highness," said the responsibilities of the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the big question of students to a deformation of the market, which also damaged the other people.
Furthermore, most of the Mietang offers include a number of miscarriages: free contracts, lack of registration, without debt price limits, unpermitted submits.
The Sunia is the need for extraordinary measures to lead to the revision of tax prices to lower prices.
In exact consideration of the research, a bedroom is needed in Mayland is about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in fourth bands black) and ends 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or about 900 euros in the fourth Vittoria.
In Florence, a bedroom costs average €350/400, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate on the university, 250/280 euros are for a bedroom of Netten, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the fourth rooms around the unit at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
It's just a little more deep in the neighborhoods around the other universities Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Scientificity.
Only who escapes in the foreign area can escape money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a private room in Prenestina, Centokelle and similar quarters.
In Neapel, you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, for a room, the price between 400 and 600 euros is located in the most precious neighborhoods, the polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedroom of 250-350 euros, a single room is at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have more weight in the urban economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenon of the residence of foreign students is more often, such as Perugia, there is even another anonymity: a minute that is over 25-30% of the average is required by foreign students.
Review to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema
The historical kins are closed because of the favorite multiplexkinos.
"A city without kinosale is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the registor Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is now in the large cities of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinema, which began with the birth of the great multisale complexs in the Periphery, means long-term death for the single kino in the center. A process that appears not only unnecessary and inevitably, but also leads to the courses of a cultural crime.
The most historical places are full memories, "It is like to lose a friend, with a part of a strasse full of emotions", says the director of the film "New Cinema Paradiso", which introduced the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It is the story of a capital kidnapper and its usuality, which is to live in a probably lost cinema world for 20 years ago.
The numbers that the Anec delivered central purchase association speak a significant language: in the past five years the unexpected number of 316 traditional cines have to close; these ceilings paid mostly the Kinos in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Mayland, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most strong regions in the regions concerned include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost chinos, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the lombardei with 41.
This proves that the main responsibilities are the multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern cines was registered: 195 in the past five years the Lombardei has the lists, 81 are both in the Toscana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paul Protti, President of the Anec, "as it is useful to give new structures, but first, it is the content of the existing, because a room in the city is not all of its seeds are ready, instead of seeking a multiplexkino in the Periferia.
And here remains the lack of state for the Fund of the Acquisition Association: the debt charge marked by the State is around 10 million euros.
It is a damage from the ethical and moral position that the government does not take account of the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be in the year of NET."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that has decided to protect the old cinemas, which is the first agreement between the Community and the Anec, which is to protect and support the traditional cinema, which is both in the historic centre and in the Periphery.
In the predicted measures, tax allocations for cine operators and benefits of public transport are also available: it will be allowed to walk in the transported areas of the centre and also to park for more parking costs.
"It is a joyful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornator, "I hope that other cities will be connected to our example and also produce new concepts.
But of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to direct anything against the multiplexal power, as finally the public is more accurate today.
The defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important subject for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the explanatory point that leaded me to establish the "New cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
Since 25 years old, I live in Rome; when I passed in the Rialto or in the Kirinale in the National Via, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turned to the side to not to see the stabbed placets.
The links between policy and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the Minister of Citizenship of Gioia Tauro
"The chief of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piromalli.
The accused of the advocate of the Antimafia advisers Calbriens against the Citizens Meeting Jorgio Dal Torrione and his director Rosario Schiavone of the Community of Gioia Tauro, who has been arrested this morning because of mafiage business.
Joacchino Piromalli, the older partner between the clan and the public administration, as well as its nephew: the lawyer who has the same name as the boss of the Clan, was already condemned by the development in criminal associations of the mafia, then to a deterioration sum of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard misconduct," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consultation activities."
"In this way the mafia group was made possible, so the judges were to cut off on a official way to the Council's households and to agree with public management policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Kalabrien Agazio Loiero does not stipulate that it is "all other than an exception to cut into connections of local governments and organized crime." "They are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in other areas where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who are opposed to the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta': herds who receive a white West.
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with whom Clan Piromalli police was engaged.
Since the end of April, the Joia Tauro Communist has been dissolved, but since 1991 – and at that time, the local politicians of their community members were deleted.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, then the Udc citizensman, was elected to head of the Mediterranean Coalition in May 2006.
He shouted Scandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the Council of Commons.
He was interested in the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, who was interested in having found everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in relation to the arrest order of this morning that the Piromalli Clan had even held it to request a change in the A3 project.
A hearing on the investigations regarding the case Dal Torrione showed that the will of a entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group on piromalli has been the same as the interests of this clan."
When the energy goes out of the waves, the larges are slowly up
It is an unreasonable source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and now seems to be understood by the large energy companies of the world.
Wells, streamings and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking at all, and also to seek busy, like giants like Chevron.
The possibility of winning energy from the movements of the sea is taken into consideration and investigation for 70 years; these studies have not been adversely intensified since the first earthly oil crisis.
When the oil price in 1980 was cut off the idea of the marine energy, but now the environmental organizations and the generous oil prices are understood to new impulse in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimates that 15% of the worldwide energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean wools.
This is equal to the duplicate of the energy generated by atomic power devices at the moment.
Furthermore, the trailings and weathers will also be carried out.
Get up at the attack.
The first company, now put on the sea energy, is Enersis, which signed a contract on the establishment of a energy work in the Northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more enterprises from the traditional energy sector that are put on the marine energy profit.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of one of the known American Gigants in the Wall Street Journal of America – has the opportunity to cooperate with us."
It is to create a authorisation of the American energy committee that is necessary to start a project before the Coast of Alaska.
This is an unpredictable sign, e.g. when you remember that only in Alaska oil is continued to be promoted by the United States and President Bush recently put the plans for new foods in Gang.
In addition to Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who invest in the new sector, are also not known to the details, but the observers speak of an increased interest.
More improved technologies.
Experts speak of one of the technicians that are still in the slaughter, since the last doubts of the protectives are not yet cleared.
Today, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are more smaller and no serious environmental problems seem to be caused.
However, to produce energy in a large scale table, there is a need for technologies with a larger impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power almost uses a system of connected boomen.
The shift of the waves that moves the bowls and moves the bowls will be converted into hydraulical pressure within the swimming pools and cylinders.
This takes a turbine that works again with a generator.
The electric is sent through subwater guides to the coast.
There are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for public approval, and a part of the won energy could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power has already produced energy for a car rental house and a parking laundry with a subsee turbine in the East River of New York.
Water movements during the time are taking the tourbines that are covered by the motor movement of the generator.
According to Verdant, there is already a long shift of possible customers on the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the times.
A special interest is provided by the Institute for Electricity Research at the moment of the potential covered in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sun instraction, and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
The current energy is that the states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other Coast States have to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009 have already been planned up to $35 million.
