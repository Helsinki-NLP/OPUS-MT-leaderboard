A Republican strategy to prevent Obama's re-election
Republic leaders justified their policy for the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brandan Center considers this last mito and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, the Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will be threatened in part by the American Democratic System.
In contrast to what happens in Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
At that same time, a majority of American governments promulgated new laws that difficulted the registration or vote process.
This phenomenon has been extended after the elections of November 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 legislative projects were introduced in 2011 which restricted the exercise of vote law in 41 states.
The new election laws require the elections to submit an identity document with a photo, in addition to a test of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the previous vote periods, invalid the right to be registered as a elector on the day of the scrutiny and to retire their right to vote to citizens with criminal preceding.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state requested the elections to submit a photographic identity document.
The Indian State was the first in demanding it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Law.
The Republicn authorities therefore pressed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported legislative projects in 34 states to encourage elections to submit a photographic identity document.
It is important to take into account that, in contrast to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not contain any document of identity with photography issued by a Governing Agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 have no identity document with such characteristics.
But, often, the obtaining of the requested identity document costs more than $100.
In this way, new restrictions affect young people, minorities and persons with low income.
Indeed, a 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who win less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of people over 65 years and 20 per cent of the electors between 18 and 29 years of age do not contain a photographic identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states students, the electors more voted to democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
In addition, these States authorize the members of the fishing clubs or chase clubs which are often voted to the Republicn parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no State requested the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit that requirement.
Since 2011, a twelve of states have adopted laws that require elections to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously looking for limited Spanish vote.
It seems that two of each three Spanish electors support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, the Republicn legislators supported certain laws that approve the registration of elections on the same day of the election in eight states.
Furthermore, they limited the right of persons and groups to establish an assistant service to electorals who wanted to be registered.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, election campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have been achieved that the registration rate of new elections would be in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republicn legislators adopted laws in five other states that promote the reduction of the vote period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the elections voted forward were Africans, while these were not more than 13 per cent of the electors of the State.
In the case of Spanish would happen exactly.
These are not more than 11 per cent of the electors, which is equal to 24 per cent of the people who vote forward.
However, the whites, which represent 76 per cent of the electory, are not more than 46 per cent of the citizens who vote forward.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties were fervently opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
In this regard, democratic rulers have blocked several legislative projects.
The United States Fiscal Ministry interviewed to suspend the most contravented laws.
In part, it could be limited to damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that requires the presentation of a photographic identity document.
However, it is unnecessary that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics claim the partiist nature of the voted laws, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A report of the Brandan Centre 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election college to achieve the Presidency.
It is too early to state that these legislative amendments on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
One is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, measures will be threatened in part by the American Democratic System.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you try or not?
Indeed, the PSA test presents in cases wrong results with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform inutilly medical interventions.
It's a more reason to doubt men, already retired of themselves, about whether they should be done or not.
Does the test be done or not?
We have requested two specialists advice.
In the U.S. studies, a large counting index was identified between the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and who did not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also demonstrated that there was between 30 and 40% of the possibilities of metastasis if the detection test was not carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the 50s, or from the 40s if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
African men have a higher risk index.
The key is to take a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive prisoners and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the risk level of his cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treated by prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which cases should be better chosen by an active monitoring of disease.
Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or involves a risk for their life.
Instead, we suggested that the disease is actively monitored and, if this progress is progressed, we provide treatment.
We are always determined with more frequencies criteria to decide who should or not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate PSA's prosecution and contrary to the PSA test.
This document can be downloaded (for the time only in English, but it will be offered translations within a few) in the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the surveys, the adoption of healthy life habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering disease.
We estimate that if everyone would eat well and move enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no smoke, that rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a porter of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we evaluate that around 10% of the cancers are heritarians.
Many others are still totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tabakism remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Tabak is linked to 85% of the cases of pulmone cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
The health of people is greatly damaged.
"Today, there are still 1,5 million smokers in Quebec", said André Beaulieu.
A hoper: 10 years after smoking, the risk of cancer death is reduced to half.
The weight
Fruit and obesity also favour the appearance of disease, according to CCS.
They increase the risks of mammal, colon and rect cancer, shofag, pancreas and skin.
"The investigations show that the regular practice of physical activity during the whole life protects against mother cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limited consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scalled the risks of suffering a colorrectal cancer.
Caracterical products should also be avoided.
The conservation of the flesh for its skin, seated or salary may cause the training of cancer substances.
"You can harm organ cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitaminic complexs and cancer.
However, at the time of its investigations, they are not concluded.
According to SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in other things that were observed was an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of speaking about concerns and family previouss of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs Boss in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great conmotion last summer, and with reason.
It is believed, in fact, that this forest is part of the massa-responsibilities mechanism of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, this is the part of which there was predicted the standard model: our best or "minor bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the material, which has not yet been observed in periodic terms.
But for physicians it's not absolutely clear that Higgs is.
We know without doubt that there is a new particule and that it seems very much to the higgs bosom predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data made this week in a important physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still no more data to be fully safe.
In any way, we suggest that this is Higgs, because the possibilities of being wrong seem to be little.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unleavenable law that implies that two things can not be found at the same place at the same time.
There is no way to be infringing that standard and not trying too much, because it will end up damage.
Although the physical of the particules is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these features: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which indicates that two particules cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic stage"; a "statue" that constitutes, largely, of some of their features.
Physicals classify the particulates in two categories.
For one part, we find the good citizens called Fermones, who wisely obey to the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand, the bosons, a sweet panda of anarchists who have no respect for nothing, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
According to the Web page The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratorys, which, in fact, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we are not talking here, and the "power particules", which are distributed by the great forces of the nature, and with which the Higgs Boss would be in some kind of intimate form.
These boss, you should be underlined here. It's not the exotic shoes we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to a extraordinary banal bosom: the photo or the "light part" that acts as "mensageer" of the electrical force.
In fact, when a part with an electric burden accelerates or changes direction, "desords" the electrical field in that precise environment; a little like when we lay a stone to a stone.
In this "desort" is born a electronic wave (of light, the infrared, the ultraviolets, etc.) and this wave is not another thing than one photo; i.e. one of the "force Porters".
Stableest field
It happens the same with the Higgs forest, with the difference in which it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" so that this forest appears.
However, Higgs' field is much more stable than the electrical field. To activate it, there is no need to reach extremely high energy, a little like it was treated with a heat steel where only a grey stone could be displaced through the surface.
It is therefore necessary to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electronic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts and materials interact with the electrical field.
Some, such as believers, do it, but others do not: a paper strike, for example, will never be kept on themselves by the door of a neck.
And in the same way, not all the particules interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (which the photo is true), do not have it.
Well, what can you bring all these investigations, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and also allows physicians to select the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For its part, many want to be found, because the less difference could open a door to a "new physical" that digs some of the model's axis.
This, it must be said, has still huge shortages, as it does not propose any explanation on seriousity ('ups!) or the dark matter, which meets around 80% of the material of the universe (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in CERN until the time.
Impacts
The impact of these investigations in our day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong when we say that there is no one.
To see: At the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratory do not absolutely suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They were undergoing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physical Willard Boyle already said, he worked in the Bell laboratory, where the laser was invented in 1960, and developed the first continuous laser (the first was pulled) in 1962, the laser was most well considered a "laboratory device".
I'm impressed.
Furthermore, applications can also be carried out from all the instrumentation which is around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light captain in 1969 in the transit of its optic research.
Although it was not absolutely its original intention, this captain now serves "hoo" for all the digital devices in the world, which valued the physical nobel in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that LHC's activities want to necessarily transform our lives, but that you never know...
Pariatic care. The best way to die... . . Le Devoir
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be back soon as a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Devoir tried to see him looking.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived only in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that he was destroying had given him a breath of two years.
"I had been given five years of life, but I already took this seven," reports, a pass, cut into her bed in the centre of Beloeil's paleary care, which came the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," continues.
The disease has caused it rare: a huge weakness that prevents him to go only to the bathroom and even to eat alone.
Sit up against an appealed lunch, accepted to help you eat.
It is important, even to smile, to talk to the unknown who give him attention, to bring medications and offer a bathroom.
The value of ordinary death.
"My biggest desire is that I worry about diarrea, it's humility," admits.
A few hours later, the team found that badly.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes a footbooth," says Peter Brodeur, psychologist in the centre of Victor-Gadbois.
Return to your childhood, for certain people, is an inacceptable humillation.
"This depends on the ability of the person to accept that return," stated.
Because, according to the view of the majority of people who work in paliative care, the great moments have occurred in the heart of that return.
All patients in the Victor-Gadbois paliative care center suffer cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
In that state, the physicians and nurses team that are rounding them no longer offers the "curative" care.
The largest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years of age, is to die "conscious and endured".
But illness made him discovering his children.
"I have good kids," adds.
"There are no longer desires in this life," said, before accepting that a masker is put to him to help her breath.
And wait, in the next days, for the last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a voluntary group, the care of the body is offered and supported for food.
They are paliative care that they are given when nothing else can be done.
To help your death to be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a paliative bed for each 11.700 inhabitants.
It's too little, because we know that we're all going to die some day.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
It is already the level of physical comfort, emotionally.
Moribund is offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of the cotidian.
Tonight we served a bird to Mr. X, who died in the night's course.
Tonight, his son ended the bird to the feet of the digest.
"We help patients and their lovers," reports Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois centre the days are walking without being never equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who saved his last family meeting in the patio, well placed between his dinners while everybody drinks his health, a 36-year-old young man dies tragicly, rounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying to survive.
"There are six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by less than 45 years of cancer sickness," Dr. Christian Martel is concerned.
A 53% of patients who are accepted in the Victor-Gadbois centre comes from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to paleary care
A 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to paliative care, i.e. the care designed to facilitate suffering when a nursing arrives to the terminal phase of their life, or in their home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the community of paleary care at the Grand Montreal house, are almost specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great deficiency in the health care care of Quebec, which many specialized doctors in paliative care, is the adoption of a law which regulates Ethanese and the assisted self-suicide.
Since October, a manifest signed by paliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circle to demonstrate its opposition to that initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent to ensure that any person has the right to high quality care before it is accepted by Etanasia.
"Recently," reports, "I have seen a patient passing 14 days in Urgences suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to relief it.
I am afraid that patients want to die only because they do not receive appropriate care."
And parallelly, many employees are obstinated with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already less than when he left a slower chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my grandmother that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that I would have given a lot of regret that I wanted to stop fighting," says.
"But she had told me that there was nothing more than to do!"
No full-power care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the nurses who ask to die thanks to their caregivers that they have not attended their requests once their pain has been raised thanks to a paliative care team.
But it must be said that paliative care is not absolutely powerful for the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of Paliative Care of Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to treatments against pain in a 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors often turn to the paliative sedation, which serves to sleep to the patient until the time of their deffusion, either sporac or permanently.
We can't finish that we don't understand that part of suffering.
Each more time, unleavened disease will have the possibility of having that paliative seat.
The nurses who aren't allied say all the same, "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want eutansia," but "I want to swear me."
The performance of this report has been possible thanks to a periodism of Canada ' s health research institutions.
Accommodation real estate scenarios in Quebec
The funds of Italian mafia-based political and specialists, the funds of the BTP, the funds of the Italian mafia, are accounted, day after day, what they know of a formable "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, sindicalists and mafious.
A "industry" that was too expensive to Quebecquens, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's wonderful how the system is pulling once we cast the big media," Ironize Jacques Duchesneau, deputed in Quebec and the former chief of Montreal police.
He led the skandale stadium in 2011, which was possible thanks to a comprehensive investigation on the injuries related to road contracts in Quebec, that the first liberal minister of that time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between the industry, the clandestinian financing of the parties and the corruption between officials.
"After the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have been $1 billion in contracts", some of its instincts have to stay with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "he has been cut down to two chairs," adds, while expects to reach "to demonstrate the existing roads behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, is also applied to its intervention team, researchers and analysts of the government.
This unit also works with the police of the Marteau Scuadra, which since 2009 have made that the Montreal's "Cartel of Training" is moderate at the time of inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has conducted a series of charges for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a chain of a city of the Africans.
The next one of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just been dismissing from his Laval's 3rd town, Quebec.
It was suspected that it has been renewed to change public contracts.
It has been formally accused of ingeniers from Montreal's travel network and Italian origin businessers, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Z framework.
The latter has been encouraged by explaining the mechanism of the "system" for the obtaining of public contracts to the committee.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia intermediary that transferred the money to the Montreal Union, the party of the Generald Tremblay alcalde.
Mr. Z framework has distributed money to the right and left during the 2000 2000s, granted more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (68.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially for the Liberals in the Power.
He also acknowledged that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Infringement of the cost of contracts to be achieved
In Montreal, the "corruption" system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an exemplary of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hockey parties and firms of the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all of this as a change in contracts of shipping, whose costs were inflicted.
Other traveling network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating factures between 30 and 40 per cent in the concept of extra false.
Furthermore, a organisationer of the alcalde party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay to have made the warm view deliberately to a parallel budget and filled his suicide money boxes.
On the basis of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay dismissed at the beginning of November and brought Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies of Montreal that sounded the alarm.
As a chain of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, it was opposed to the sale of a municipal field purchased by $5 million and returned $1.6 million to promotors in full-reserve boom.
70% of the money of the election campaign was suicide money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she ensures that it takes "of a hill to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by horms, to stop the gangrena and fish the guests."
And it adds that the process is "sweet, but positive".
We're cleaning the wounds, but there would be no clean research unit in Montreal and be very warned so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on its part, declares that "the officials have robbed hundreds of millions of dollars", but it is particularly concerned about the role of the 'selections' politicians in the course of the strategy.
As estimated by 70 per cent of suicide money that was intended for the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, Ironics: "I have said that this is not more than a reflection of the reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit $100 the donations to the parties, but this will not change the donation, according to him, "as far as the electoral costs are not strictly limited, there will be suicide money in policy".
It provides a complete review of the system for the purchase of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall down; go to the background of things, with valuable valuableness, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story is the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the shore.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This time has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would this progress explain?
It could be explained by a individual consciousness, but also by the new PSG dimension.
They've got big players.
Progress from day to your side.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
And these elements encouraging me every day to increase the level of my game.
On a party, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I won't calm down.
Since my starts in the INF Preformation Centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed at agganized steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The reclutants of this summer are pleasing to discuss partitions of very high levels.
They know that each training is crucial.
That's what a player like me wants to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Anzlotti gives me a lot about my position.
It is supported by adjoints like Clude Macelele, who played in the same position as I.
Anendlotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Aringlot inspires all the technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in Link 1 and is among the best European entrepreneurs.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think it's gonna be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comfortable conversation with him.
I ended out of a series of lesions.
The confidence that you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the time?
In Liga 1, Lyon removed us the leadership position.
But we're on the shooting.
One of our greatest objectives is the Championship Link: we have classified for the end-by-style octets.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to get the best way possible.
From now, you can happen anything.
But we have to say much about many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish our first link before Oport to get the back of the end-octs.
Can PSG become a large European club short-term?
You already have the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and be there long-term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means to make it concrete.
Doesn't win the cup in Link 1 as in the last time, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great deception.
This year, we will invest all our efforts to bring us that chamber title.
In the last time we don't get far away.
In May we brought us a deception, because we met with the best conditions to end the first time.
We had a strong time.
We're finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been camps...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a pretty better time.
This year I think it's the good thing.
Even if the big teams such as Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we're counting with the weapons to bring it to us.
Does the media expect more than PSG?
It's normal to wait much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have completely accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home in Troyes, who still find themselves with things that reprove us is a little frustrating.
We're wondering what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 all week ends.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Championship, we have demonstrated that we can answer and be present.
Look at the Manchester City that, after two times, he has not been classified for the end-octs, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be disappointing our opposers and the French campeonate.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not good at the previous time, have been seen "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that the link 1 is sweet.
I hope we can say in May with a dream that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended bringing the trofee to us.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better we say we have a "Zlatan dependence".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and put many goals.
He's here to show that it's the Star of the Liga 1.
And he has shown in all the teams for which it has been a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects men who are around him.
What you have done is really exceptional.
This encourages others to increase their level of game.
Timago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, allows us also to progress.
How have you lived Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It's been a deceptive.
I was very encouraging to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my lesson stopped cumulating time of game.
I saw things there, and I came back.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blue.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this should be the case that we have an example of conduct today.
What vision do you have in the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the blue?
It's getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selectioner is strict, close to the players and inspires the winning.
Like the Laurent White case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White has achieved its goal to classify us for Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschanmps brings the selection to Brazil.
The quarter (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to sit down the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a game like my whole car.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, the identified transactions and processing loads among the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palmable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe change protocol in BitTorrent's way, which allows the exchange of files equally.
About 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about thousands of websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a payment form.
Bitcoin quotation, after reaching up to $30 (EUR23) in June 2011, falls to $2,5 months later, before returning to the $10 (in the Bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (BCE) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the virtual currency with more successful success", "which works with the dollar or the euro" and "the same as the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits" used to advance in a video game and that can be winned or can be purchased (and even in canjear occasions).
The social network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositary of accountability books, checkers, monetary employers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, guaranteeing the anonymous.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that Bitcoins changes contain the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key hito consists of writing this new transaction in that book.
This comes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and winners, a type of providing central banking, will be the privilege to add that supplementary line.
It's a stage of changing file, i.e., of transformation of a big file into a shorter and unique digital wheel.
The computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "tree" the whole.
The goal is to find the number offering a particular wheel (better cereals to the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes are easily checking that it's the good.
The transaction is then undestructively linked to the assembly chain of the other transactions; all changes would change the wheel.
If, to make a fraud, one user would want to pay two times with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as a valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphan, as both have different wheels.
The computer that resolves the challenge is taking 50 bits.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bits in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to 100 million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also shown in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already its albouts.
The websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in depósito.
"The case used does not affect the same protocol," says Peter Noizat, who has finished launching Paymium, a real currency pay company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of currency thanks to this anonymous service.
But the money in effectiveness presents the same defect.
The actors of weight like Wikipedia reject the payments of this type.
Other, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Initiative in Israel, analyzed the accountability book and showed that about 80% of non-circle bitcoins.
In November the "great powders" were launched.
"As changed $30,000," Jon Holmquist rejoiced, who works to Coinabul, who converts the bitcoins in gold.
Peter Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, equates to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but use Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which makes it more precise.
The carrier also manages his identity and may therefore remain in the anonymous.
The system is easy to start in trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They are enough to provide a address that a phone can "foto and recognise" requires Peter Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general revision movement for the Jerry systems by horizontaler systems.
"There'll be no time to Bitcoin impose, but in 2013 could have a change", predict.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to review the different risks, currently considered high, where this currency is successful.
We've been out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must go to the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army returns to possession of its territory and the Afghans choose their future without expecting anything from us.
We have sentenced mostly to the Afghan campaigns, whom we considered terrorists.
And to us, with our 88 soldiers killed, more wounds and mutilates.
The Talibans account for foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often by campsites who reject the presence of the Foreign Army, such as in the periods of the Soviet Empire.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaetic traditions, even if their causes are linked to the ehiyadists, the Pakistanians, the Arabs, the Uzbeks or the Tajikians.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurances, these will not be anymore when the Westerns are more discreet.
The partition of the French troops of the Nijrab base, which has been observed from the height of the grain planted by the French credits, was made by order.
The trucks and tanks gathered back to Kabul without suffering any attacks controlled by the helicopters.
There will be no impact of talibans in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irrestable progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country shooted in fire and blood because of the fights between different facts.
The country's control was understood as a type of release, the return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the darkness of their championians overcome by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old hamhids, the current government and the present Taliban are shared with the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
Speculators have been converted, with government lands to return them as solars for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a couple of huge United States sub-contracting contracts.
They're not trusted; most of them have not struggled.
People, as I heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by ladders.
Many young people want to move, as well as those who have been able to benefit from the American generosity: capital escape is significant.
Young people are angry of war and their ideology.
They lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, state collections are filled with both girls and children.
The young people who don't want to return to the darkness of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders will need to work.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is obtained from mobile phones. The television and its Turkish platforms that present a modern world has great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Are the authorities who want to direct the country legally considered?
The former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstituting the Provincial Military, which will be out of the central power.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the pictures of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the first minister from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, especially because of the elections provided in April 2014.
However, its country depends on the foreign aid since the 50s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no embarrassment has been resolved and the important irrigation systems have been reparated.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would be needed.
The smile that Afghanistan had greatly mine riches was expanded.
And that didn't make it any more than increased the feeling of the westerns were there to stand away from them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper of the land and without transport means to export them through mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
Chineses have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the largest buddhisation and remain as the most important employees in the province.
It will also be lacking that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country which depends widely on imports and exports, restore its normal relationships.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional support: girls, children's college, a department of French at the university, the Instituto Franco, the cooperation in military, legal, healthy and agricultural sectors and the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of "going hearts and spirits" and carrying out the impossible task to make the aid and offensive actions match, a service of "governmental and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence" (Cimic), removed in 2012, took and carried through a small French NGO work of collective interest and agriculture reconstruction in decades of mountain locations.
These works, goals of local work, have helped contain insurrection: rich, powder, powder water, restoration, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultural surfaces.
What will we leave in mind after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in those regions often located up to 2,000 meters.
The Ambassaded received decades of written applications with small agricultural proposals made by local communities from Capisa Province.
In order to be released from the insurrection carried out by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me that they want, it would have no need to maintain small civil aid, well controlled and directly reach them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a twice or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which is providingly full of powers, he decided to play all over it.
He took the whole world a surprise on Thursday, when announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had given two more months to that Assembly to end its work.
And almost two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to courts.
This new initiative has made no longer more than increased fracture in the country.
For his opposites, the President persevered in his "autocratic crime" and continues "training his word" and "thriving the right".
By its parties, it is assured that this is a measure to end more quickly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days, a referendum should be organized.
A very short time lap which imposes the sisters to refuse their project to explain the text by article to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimation while political causes are strict throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote to their favour, as stated in an interview at the American Time weekly.
Bearing in mind that this resource has been voted with a lot of rapidity, there is a ultimate for the Egyptian people: "or vote my text or keep the full powers," powers that would likely be reached to its end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, in its large majority, voted the text last night.
Most liberalians did not attend the call.
In the midst of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they closed the door because they estimated that they could not value their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, last morning 11 persons, replaced members, were added to all early.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Sisters.
As we were expected, the voted articles have been one another.
The commenters thank you, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed almost at the time of prayer, so that several members of the Committee came to think that the time of the Constitution was bad.
The text, which was still voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of all views, which remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The salaphist parties, for those who were established by the Islamic law, were a fundamental revision, expected that "principes" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamians, that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberians take it from hypocrity and consider that it is not more than a public artimage.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
It refers, in particular, to article 220, that trusts at the University of Al-Azhar, in particular for all whose compliance with Sharia laws.
According to the specialist in Egypt, Sophie Pommier is worried because "the people called to speak themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premies of a theocracy."
The fears of liberalians are also increased by the fact that the next rector of this university would be quite less moderate than the current.
"Together, there is no specific religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the legalists who have worked in this text are not ulmas but university, some of them formed in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, which prepares a test on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But recognises that it may have certain ambiguity around article 220, since the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be addressed in the future would be in the measure of the competent civil judges to be expressed above all of this."
Besides its religious nature, the voted text last has received many critics regarding the extended powers to trust the President of the Republic.
Muslim sisters will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the forces granted to the army.
In accordance with the desire of militarys, the revision of the Defence budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence Council.
The processing of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, as requested for human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns on the text, which are considered free.
The blasphemy crime is maintained and, from now to date, insults are prohibited, which could cause serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlined by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian President had to go on the television last night, manifestations for this mediumday are prescribed.
The parties of the head of State were expressed on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the struggle of the world, and a sea of salmir
The promised earth combines the gloriousness of Bible truths with modern comfort and a natural prince.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for which Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is important to visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "bautismal pill" will receive the divine grace.
And Galilea, the place of Jesus' miracles: the water conversion of wine in the wedding, walking on the waters, the disappointment of the torment and the full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest sacred places are located in Jerusalem.
The believers here refer to the Viacrucis or the Camin of the Cruz of Jesus (in Latin "Beast").
Starting in the Force of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the judgment was completed, and continued through the streets of the Viya city, goes to the Holy Sepulcro in the Gulgota Mountain, the place of the crucifixation, the Piedra of the Unity and the place of Jesus's sepulturation.
In this same place the symbolic Christian tribulation of the world is also found, symbolized by the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cruz in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree that was made the cross for the crucifixation of Jesus.
The most holy place for the Jews, the wall of the Lamentation, is also in Jerusalem; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As a tradition, people from different religions leave notes with their desires, which will then be realized.
Realize a vertical journey
The destruction of the Masada Force was a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herodes the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in mountain squads at a height of 450 meters above the sea level.
And reaching there by their own means, they can only those who are dedicated to the scale.
Others can reach this historical summit in the fungicular.
And in the northern of the country to a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous station of Hermon, where in the winter months there is a great impact of tourists.
Together, from the foot of the colline, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski pitches is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, in the top of the mountain they were supposedly living by pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is the worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israel parliament).
In it the ancient Manuscripts of the World Sea or Rollos of Qumran, discovered in the clouds of the wilderness of Judah, and about 500 000 pieces of archaeological and anthropological piece.
It is important to visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings with printers and expressionists such as Month, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of old Turkish bathrooms with figures of visitors and bathrooms of that time.
In Cesarea, it is the penalty to pass through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where Rodin and Dali can be admired.
There there are no tourist guides or shops of suvenirs.
The entry is free, and catalogically don't accept donations.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv shows one of the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of children, built in memory of 1,5 million children killed in concentration fields and gas cameras.
Go in him and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are brilliant.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their life.
Ukrainian is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located at the Mediterranean sea, the Red Sea and the Death Sea.
In each of them there are pools, aquatic parks, delfinarys and oceanographic museums.
It is wonderful that in the Red Sea even in winter months, since water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air calms up to 23 degrees.
The Death Sea is still more calm and there are bathing throughout the year.
Indeed, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lower point of the planet: at 417 m below the level of the sea.
The blue waters from there are a salmière that easily supports those who do not know breathing.
The landscapes of the surroundings are really beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmour and curative bars and to strengthen their health in cases of demotitis, allergy, asma, eczema, artritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their nervous ruptures.
To do the mysteries of ancient nature
The old part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, is in the Mediterranean coast.
This was the famous maritime route that joined Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, he was here where Noah built his ark and Perseo saved the beautiful Andromeda with who, in this same place, brought a long and happy life.
Tourists like to walk through the close streets that bring the names of the Zodiac characters.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mysm" symbol, the happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, a couple of recently married couples come from all parts of Israel, and even from other countries to be photod.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herodes, can pass through the Roman theatre, "tom" the strength of the crushed.
In the Roman era, Cesarea was the main city of Judah and the residence of the Roman Prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and spectacles of opera.
Tourists Remember
If he travels to Israel, it is not worried if his English leaves much to wish: in this country around 30% of the Russian population speaks.
The money for this trip is not recommendable to bring it into euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shells (as currently $1-3.8 sketches).
Urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there is rapid trail and there is the only metro line of the country, which contains six stations and connects the city of Baja with the High City.
In fact, it is a subterranean official.
Travel to any type of public transport costs 6 squeques and for this price you can travel transborder for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Saturday celebrates Sabbath.
From Thursday night to the sun of Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday for morning begins a new week of work.
In many coffee, restaurants and hotels only serve cosher food, which excludes sweat meat, marisco, fish without scams and plates, where it combines milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of vacuum and skin meat, sopa and posts prepared with cocoal milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a large variety of salts, the flamphel, which are mold grains, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel no street dogs see.
Instead, there are many well-educated cats that "spend to their guests" implicitly.
Tonight you can see them sleeping even on the teeths of the shocked cars.
The throne players like the competited places and do not reject the golosin.
The rent of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides the security, that goes out for $15 per day.
And the rental of a bicycle will get him out of 15 sheets the day.
The entries to the museums care for a average of 30 skeels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists throughout the world.
The majority of those who arrived to run the country and relaxing were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Earth, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeded 51 per cent to the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants strike for the language
While Members and Defenders of Human Rights discuss on the consequences of the binding review law, they have already appeared in the dynamic country that trade with "fakes" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrants arrive to Moscow, San Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey.
Its only goal is to win money to help your families who have remained home.
Since 1 December, a law should enter into force, according to which every working immigrant must conduct a review to verify its knowledge of the Russian language.
This rule is currently applicable only to those who are intending to work in the service providement sector, Community services institutions, household services and smaller trade.
However, with the time, as they promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the reviews will be binding for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to make the review of the language, if not the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language should be confirmed even for receiving and renewing the work permit.
There are exceptional citizens of countries where Russia is the official language.
They will not be subjected to this law to those who have been able to obtain their education and diplomatic certificates before the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991.
Use, fatality and defence of rights
The network of research centres will be employed by the Russian Lengua Pushkin Institute, the University of the Popeables, the State University of Moscow, the State University of San Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be presented to tests in all cities, now in Russia are open to more than 160 centres of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputy of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, very long before the law entered into force, have been able to make this question to press many times: What will it actually bring?
What changes will bring the obligation of Language knowledge, both for Russia and for immigrants?
First, they respond to representatives of the Immigration Service, which will allow to reduce the number of people suffering "worker slaves".
Many people today talk about the defence of the rights of labour immigrants, Victor Sebelev, head of the representative of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
Defence of its rights must be initiated before its submission.
Only one organized selection system will enable immigrant workers to solve the problem in 90% of cases.
Problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find people without srugs that, with the pretext of help, put him a "payed visit" to a close covague, where he and decades of others as he are consumpted for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours per day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In your patriarch they promise something, but when they are inflicted, they are free of their passports, they do not pay them for the promised salary", confirms the Chief of the Tajikistan Migration Service Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to go, but also write difficultly in their own language.
Of course, this is not both your fault but its own disgrace: the turkmen, the uzbeics, the Tajikians, which can be given the luxury of receiving normal primary education.
This should be that their families do not have anything to eat children, not talking about their clothes, clothes and buy them what is necessary for the school.
As youth reaches, these kids become attractive to work at the first time.
It is difficult, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"Another feeling humble and lower."
However, as regards the language law, the rights defenders point out an important point.
Exams shall be carried out only for immigrants whose status and status are legal.
If there is no status, there will be no review and, therefore, no official work.
While the majority of immigrant workers remain illegally living in Russia.
Welcome or forbid the step to strangers
Many visitors say that we receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the burocratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 000 to 10 000 rubles.
However, a false registration can be made rapidly and only thousands of rolls.
Russian police employees know that we are generally taking false documents, we are not registered and the cases of extortion appear.
"We ask 100 or twenty-five rolls for cigarettes or tea", commented the journalists of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamo.
"Get, you're not a bathroom, buy a painting."
The first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was shown that not only immigrant register documents can be false.
A number of "false" Language knowledge certificates have already been charged by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The false documents were printed in colour printer standards.
Of course, the hands of the new owners were not as a gift: each immigrant wants to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid by the document by seven thousand rubles.
This is two times and half more precious than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a next future is to protect the corruption system so that the "disciples" cannot be purchased, convert government officials and rights defenders.
At the time, the authorities may promise immigrant workers that they could not have been successfully reviewed the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who are not talking about Russia will provide work that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to implement the law more strictly regarding civil use weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: to shoot fires during the wedding celebrations in which there were no victims, and the mask initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, where Apretar 7 people have lost life.
The police wants to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to increase the minimum age for the obtainment of licensing of weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the chief of the Duma Security Committee and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the Duma of the State in a future.
Not everyone feels satisfied with the fact that Russian authorities are trying to oppose this problem by applying the "during hand policy".
The network has appeared an open letter, which authors, representatives of various social organizations of tylers, require that such measures are dismissed from "regovernance without sense".
The percentage of vandalism acts with registered weapons is minimum, commented on the BBC news service, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were conducted with the use of fire weapons registered in Interior bodies, with a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are safe that a more strict legislation in the civil use of weapons will not be an inconvenient towards the Black Market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapons at low price.
While, the Ministry of Interior states that the situation of proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officials
The weapons' weapons market is cut through several channels.
The main channels are years of age, says the colonel Victor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the High State of Mayor for ten years.
Screen capture of the website accepting weapons requests
The first, "walking of the army or military", namely, the weapons that were robbed during military action in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were shocked by Russian officials and the same cacasses," says Baranets.
The following type of black weapons, robbed by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that the weapons of the police store stocks are included here and those slaughtered directly by officials of the law enforcement bodies.
Illicit weapons go to sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals, there were explosions often.
"There are versions demonstrated that some fires were caused premediately to cover the lack," said an exmiliator.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand grants.
"Here they have proliferated private weapons manufactures that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the sight of the black market, including the Moscow," said the experts.
A more source of the black market is the contraband.
A large number of weapons and amétralators come from poor countries like Kirgistan.
"All there are with their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that has organized the weapon flow," explains the former military.
Where are the weapons coming?
Experts have calculated the nearly participation of each of these sources of illegal weapons supply to the black market.
A report on this issue was drafted in 2011 by the Public Management Analysis Centre.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal library and public port access data, which are around the weapons.
The large majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from armed forces and security forces.
The half of the weapons of the black market has come there "for the fault of officials whose work is related to the weapons", says in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where armed conflicts are carried out, 14 per cent of the cases were robbed during the production of weapons and 5 per cent corresponds to the "illicit architectology".
The dependant of one of the weapons shops, who asked his phone not to be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal scatters do not buy them anybody for a long time because they are too old.
More often, it says, providers are leading to military store when they need a game.
By means of some alferez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They eliminate the record and pass it above the authority.
"This brings the weapon to the city and sell it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," we account
"But, of course, the police is both of all matters, and regularly, when the crime detection plan is to meet, they make test purchases to illegal weapons traders", adds the dependant.
"Come in a luxury bottle."
The buyer and the buyer are often found through known people.
"Web pages and blogs until a guy I propose to go to the "Begovaya" platform where a man would bring me to a "squinite" where we could negotiate.
From the weapon price, I just entered it there."
Communicator Victor Baranets
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," said the shop dependant. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust in him too much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there is also need to be reached, we say "of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to say that a dent had fallen to his daughter."
Even I can get a pair of steel hands through a person of confidence.
He also provides them only to me because he knows I'm not going to drag him.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tested in the role of an illegal weapons purchaser in the mid-90s when a article on this issue was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where he wasn't "of all".
"I feel like in a luxury bottle," remembers the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer you a cat for love: everything that there is can be proved.
I, as potential customer, not only purchase; we're going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"Do me the opportunity to shoot, and when I assure that the weapon shoots well, we start to negotiate", describes the expert.
Sopha switch
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups where weapons are offered for different purposes.
For this, no document or personal meetings are required.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising advertising "Buy a gun or a gun."
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And they sell the older ones?
"No permission, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (conserved ortography).
"Compense weapons TT. Moscú", laconally makes his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a wide network of fixed web sites and captured two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
And the people go, as a fish hungry to the cerebrous, and then extract carbon in Siberia
Military commenter and exhibit Victor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: generally, the website is registered outside Russian laws.
People make the requests.
The buyer performs the payment through an automatic box.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO 's press secretariat " The right to weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that if a online request is made, one stays without weapons and put it into prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a wide network of fixed web sites and captured two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
"And people go, as a fish hungry to the cerebrous, and then to extract carbon in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal fire weapons, according to experts, one may be sold from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO 'The Right to Arms', a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It must be expected for a month and a half.
It is sent from military store by the heads of a medium-range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was at 7 per cent, which represents 22.900, and the number of cases identified in robbery and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosives and explosive artificials reduced by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast and supermarket food restaurants in the U.S.
Even a fourth part of the United States adolescents find their first jobs as "McDonald's" in "McDonald's"
In the past days, a protest gallery has been launched against low salary payments in the Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of rapid food chain, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one is trying to warn if he's coming or not to the nine points, or if he's intended to lose forces and smile in his first stages.
Protection actions are supported by the unions and a series of left NGOs.
In addition to the increased wage modests resulted by the workers of Walmart and the rapid food system, the goal of protest organizations is the creation of employees in these enterprises.
For now, this sector of the economy has not been employed by the syndical movement.
Forty and six hundred per year?
The actions started last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving, the called "Negro Viernes". That day, in the United States, coherenced the body of floors that captured millions of people, and sometimes was accompanied by combats.
In that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which are employed at 2,2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets together with the synagogue and actives of the left in the corporation shops, whose products lead to people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sold from all, from swimming pools, swimming pools and snakes for cars, even aspirators, eggs and milk.
Products in their shopping are average between 8% and 27% more cost than those of the largest supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid workers of Walmart are buying only in the job.
Availability and extent of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the two critical words, Walmart can be allowed to sell products very low prices, in part because they pay little to their workers.
These are also demanded from bad working conditions, such as lack of mounting or hand scanners.
The "Noir Weerns" of the manifestation required the increase in salary and was claimed that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation passed from 30 to 100 monthly.
For a typical Walmart worker, receiving $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is too much, they said.
Scientifics at the University of California in Berkeley claim that if Walmart increases the average payment up to $12 per hour, this will cost $3.2 billion.
This is about 1,1% more than it costs in loans now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in the shadows of consumers, each visit to the shop will result in only 46 percent more precious.
In one year they will cost the rigid amount of $12,39 more than they pay now.
Walmart's partys comment satisfied that the protest had so far in nine states and that it did not cause any loss of corporation.
The "Noir Wednes" continued in his shops from Tuesday from 8 to midnight next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its registered boxes performed the "Noir Wednes" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the left website Huffington Post, which left his work position "minus than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest wasn't more than "other truck of public relations", organized by the workshop.
"Chaja free!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly the Walmart large stocks (which has no appreciation in this progressist city, and therefore there is no one now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that sales thousands of thousands of parts, and then they don't even give you low for disease and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumae Williams, New York Municipal Council member
Today, in accordance with the Federal and New York Act, the minimum payment is $7.25 per hour.
Speed food restaurants will increase it with time, but only slightly, and in average, ordinary workers receive $8,90 per hour.
No one wins less than they're in this city.
How can I survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost fourth part of the U.S. adolescents passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, partly after school, even though they lived with their parents.
Some were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, constantly tropical in some interviews with McDonald's workers who want to live from this salary, and sometimes even even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that the author states that it is irresponsable to have children if you don't know what to eat.
The protest participants, which started on Thursday 6:30 on Thursday morning at the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food chairs and kitchens start to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, or that their current minimum payment was duplicated.
They also requested the workers' syndicates in the rapid food sector.
The U.S. Law prohibits the administration to prevent them of this right and punish the workshops of the synagogue movement with arguments and disappointments.
Moreover, the administration is rarely facilitating their life.
However, for objective reasons, it is easy for the syndicates to cover the rapid food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discords
Ruidos protests were placed on the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was placed by half of the mitin in the McDonald's place near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of the municipal Council of the city Jumae Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's sell thousands of portions, and then not even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other highlighted democrats in New York, for example, for example, from the candidate to the home of the city Bill de Blasio, which said that "we must support the workers of the fast food sector in order to obtain it fair wages and economic prosperity that each neoyorkino worth".
As described in the New York Times magazine, this was the greatest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But there were only few hundreds of people, even not all of them were employed by the fast food service, where they worked for decades of thousands of people in New York.
It is not clear if this will serve from Chispa to cause massive movement.
"To now, lie to the brain does not result so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular between modern technologies, has recently been generally understood through special bands.
At the beginning of the summer, in his annual Google conference showed a model in movement and later, in November, Microsoft had also been given a request to claim the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technologie group in the Microsoft Laboratory of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the skins already belonged to a past stage.
They attract the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with swimming hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the individual-orienter interaction, but we also tried to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its large mass has been touched in the work stage with the pixels of the planet screen, sometimes touching the dent.
But we want to look at 5-10 years and advertise the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as it is interested in control by loops.
- What more is our future?
- Despite Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of this is still happening in a plate screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in really tridimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer must be freed to our, physically, to do more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognise not only the user, but also the space that it rounds.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the hell with those tits of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
A very popular detail, but do you think they're overcoming it?
- Of course, you can't be considered a panacea, and it's quite persistent to solve the issue of privacy, because it is not always desired that others may know our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in your own field.
For example, for the control of devices on public places, we had a project in which we thought on the shoes, but not in smooth movements, but more shorter.
Furthermore, the shoes were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it's very big, but in the theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulsing watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combinated type of control, for example, play + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda side?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognise.
- Or, do you want to bind users to adapt to what you can or can't do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the next future, we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine the responses of the person precisely.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, because they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have from the modern cameras?
Do you miss resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixel, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
Since this last point of view, all current technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work to the algorithm designers.
That is, that we need to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y edges, but also in Z.
It is also important the speed, the number of tables per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for shoes.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, has made a contact sensor with adjustable delay of 1 to 100 ms and has been mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work a equivalent of that device, but it doesn't require contact to make the tables more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the employer of infrared rays and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diapath.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Positively, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or instead, it increases and increases the amount required for calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analysis of Kinect, play with the cameras' location curve and see how this would help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- Because I remember, Microsoft, as a difference with Google, has not presented its gifts to the public.
Doesn't you feel that, from the view of the daily use of realistic technologies of reality, skins are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, passing all therats supporting an intelligent phone in the hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass from the gifts to the intelligent phone,
The gifts are very personal devices, in that it is your strength (private things are only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on darks will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark's film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often indicate: there is no tactic response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think it could be the addition of tactic feelings.
While, one of the most interesting trucks is the use of the second hand in quality support for the image.
Register the tattoo perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really directed to bring tangible to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the deed is found from a similar feeling as that one feels if someone was overlooking it in the eggs of the deeps, but this feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulseers for the munique that affect the nervous conclusions of the teeth, this is also a promised address.
- Have you tried to lie the brain?
Do you think that he feels what it seems to be feeling at the time you see something?
- That's a good idea, we're not trying.
Here it is hidden another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very lower space believes that is going to a open space, almost without end. We are working also in the idea of the hurling cities (not as the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as in the magnificent globals.
For now, infringement of the brain does not result so easy, there is still need to work for many years.
That is what the work is touching with the virtual reality for researchers, which many things are found in a total conception state.
Subjective personal favor instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues to the "Vanguardism of San Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, to the advantage of art and culture.
In this list of best figures of the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose successes come beyond the city, are often acknowledged in Europe without the Russians even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a swimming man on the top of red, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the winter garden or at mode and inaugurations meetings.
Kirill Miller's tables always affect multitudes, where they wanted to be exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilosophys of San Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the Vanguardism of St. Petersburg at the end of the 80s.
Moreover, it is a urban man whose appearance appears on the streets of the city slowly in the dreams and up to all the state of spirit.
Recently, he took a organ in his hands and became the organist of San Petersburgo, since he has trained to make such a hard role, for his existence of bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going to the red town, not to be sweet or sweet, for example?
I chose the red color because I'm a mode designer and I'm dedicated to the appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey causes aggressiveness and agitation of property nothing good.
But my provocations are directed to start a conversation.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you understand you should be artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky culture palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had been finished, and the new, free like me, were still in business.
I made my friends of the new wave artists, with those who were exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, who brought to "Pushkinskaya-10", and already ended the new loud.
I put me in the theatre for clothes, music of all genders, but not for letters.
And all this took place in your art Clinic for me was important to meet me in the cultural center of San Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there was no reforms, there was a musical club, a bohemia club, the bohemia house of San Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remembering how Schnur brought the project to "The Prayer of Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sing light songs under the background, closed adapted pants, including the current Igor Vdovin mode composer.
When the group started to touch in life, he became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before Hali-galivskih’s times.
We told them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of their great car; basic education and training received it from us.
"D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and asylum customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when the culture means something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the premium was "The people of our city".
In the name "Year Artist" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times, I am not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
In our days it is easy to make popular, but culture and popularity will be separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something acknowledged in your work.
- Many of my paintings are shooted, in them it is clearly expressed the currentity and occurrence.
I'm going to make a programed exhibition, "The Russian Museum in payasos."
Payments are a time category.
I was formerly sociable, but now being so, it's painful and atterrant.
But in the bathrooms, everything is injured and the tragedy is removed.
I like the biggest, I have great ideas.
For example, world salvation through total and binding changes of clothing.
Now one follows it by the clothing, oriented on the outside, but not in the inside of the person.
And perhaps that person should not be able to give him or to give his hand, but to cut him in the face.
And the lie will be removed when it changes clothes.
We haven't seen you in the role of a city organic.
Who's better than me to be it!
- Well, but, can the commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tacton.
We are a witness of the desintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouping in hands, the bohems wanted something, the simple ones others.
Now, everyone has divided in micro communities, it's difficult to make up to everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to love you all.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every worship hero has its 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov comes for thousands!
- We'll see the left, there works the sex-social area.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 100,000 will never sell, as a result, less management, less money, everything is marked.
I've got my fans, the most important thing is, you don't smell them, don't escape losing what you've done.
When youth was doing such tables that a colleague collective the teens collected on the wall side of Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people generally ended.
Now they often confusion the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another history.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected the money only to draw squares.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburgo?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: the functional of culture.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were the right things were otherwise, the kings may not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good advisors.
We have people in San Petersburg that may well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level that correctly evaluate them and open their ways.
Now you're prospering the subjective personal favorite.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to search for other museums.
- What's the matter for you?
- San Petersburgo is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is a terrace.
But on our stones it is difficult that art grows.
We need cultural land and we now have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are many people with curiosity that goes to exposure and consciousness.
In our case, this class is nice.
We have to make art be modest, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a subvention of San Petersburg.
Solution in space
Earth is in danger.
Global or shocking with a killer asteroid.
Space ships with humans on board go to search for a repos planet.
To preserve humanity is the main question: How can the species continue in conditions of pregnancy or in the same residue planet?
I think there's little way to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"This are Venus and Marte," said the head of the State Astronomy Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mart are best for life, at the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live in large heights or in Venus' orbit... in the space.
It was started to address the reproduction problems in the space with the flower.
A half-century centuries ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of guiding cultivated in orbit were not different from the earthquakes.
Then came the creature of insects in the orbit, small muscles of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, the codorniz egg was sent to check how the embryo was developed in pregnancy conditions.
We get a normal polluter as a result.
But then start the problems.
"The problem is that this pollute must be supported, must be maintained on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Laboratory Institute of Biomedic Problems (IPBM) of Russian Science Academy.
When the pollutants didn't find support, they returned when they shooted.
And after 10 hours in the newborn, there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Pollulos did not react to light or sound.
And the regret was that during four days, they just died.
"And two times we could born the pollings, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the pollutants in the space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" fly to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the "Bion" biosatellite, it will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space already with fetes.
In principle, nothing overnatural was found.
"This was exactly in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out", comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the earthquake, space races were descending.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
The animals, losing their habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
The man, however, can, in principle, be different from the small animals.
The Homo sapiens has abstractous reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional fund.
Similar experiences are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk passed it to Tereshkova.
And the most precise thing that humanity has is the women's body.
Our gang flying, and nobody on the earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You can or don't have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question” comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze airspace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first woman cosmonauta, Valentina Tereshkova, gave a daughter light.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had two times been in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the persistent risk.
We are little, the astronauts are counted after long flights all have been good, and a healthy generation will grow.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," recalling the cosmonauta pilot, the Soviet Union hero, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology, radiological protection, in creating artificial gravity.
The water laboratory of the Cosmonautic Preparation Center is a binding stage for flight preparation.
In terms of no fleetability, cosmonautes practice their working skills in space.
C-2, we're moving in on the water.
If water is a comfortable environment for adults, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his birth element.
Small-anfibic men seem to be confirmed that life on the earth has occurred from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found within about 9 months of its mother in the ammonic liquid, because it will be easier to get to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the first bathroom pass only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, narrative monitor.
Summary, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a new birth, for women the gravitation, the force of gravity is required.
In pregnancy, abdominal muscles and pelvis are decrease very fast, the ability to exclude fetus is reduced.
Well, we omited it, trusting the action of stimulants for the birth.
Of course, light can be made in a special camera, it will press it.
"And what then?" Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.
Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleto or the muscle system.
A new born in orbit is impossible to clothe it with a special clothing for training, such as adults.
It will simply be free of what is vital for him.
"And this experience we're going to do together, allowing a child's birth in a strange environment, will give us place to bring the Earth to a disabled person, to a completely inadequate person," prescribes the head of the Biological Committee of the Institute of Biomedic Problems of Russian Science Academy, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, with the time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships lead to a far-large planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
NKU Chief: The "shvarc" system is not inspected by the guilty political
In the field of public appeal, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although it is fully implemented.
Thus, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) states that it was an interview for Update.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my view, what we miss", describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being automatic only on the role, which is known as the "shvarc".
The first minister said recently that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not struggle businessers with inspectors. Then is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in any manner and, in that case, nor the President of the Government may prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or to require obligations", states Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Control at the Congress of Members, you spoke of the common project between the Checaan team and the German, in which the legislation relating to public acquisitions was compared in both countries.
What is exactly?
This is a paralel control that we have started carrying out some two years ago.
This is a simple way: European legislation regularizes how public appeal should be organized, and this continues to the existing legislation in each country and then practice in itself.
We have joined it all and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "wise and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can actually provide this project? What do you think that these conclusions are?
Only a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the achievement of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of the loan means obtaining a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, longly, criminal actions.
But not because we reduce the limit of the contracts, it means that we are going to get it.
Maybe because the system is saturated with both "papeleo", which those who want to search for errors in the system can make it easier than if the limits remain so high as now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public appropriations.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is it a office like our NKU or is it otherwise organized?
As far as offices, such as the NKU, there operates the Federal Accounts Court, with a similar organization as we, with a colleague, the only thing is that in their case is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The competitives are also analytical, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the account courts are even at this level, in this regard slightly detection of our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we call for state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled in Germany by the Federal Court of Accounts.
What about the local legislation, is it more simple than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely required in what is better.
Could, for example, be better about the quality of inspectors?
That's sure not, but I repeat, I don't like to do this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model should face a large number of problems.
If not so, you wouldn't like any benefit to cooperate with our office, do you think?
As regards our country's legislation, what did it mean for its Office the law amendment on public appeals?
Bearing in mind that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in control action.
Since we perform ex post controls, we need to be counted with a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the preparation process of future controls: we have started a new tool for "detection of non-economic risks", which has been conducted by almost 14.000 public contracts, which have been analyzed, which will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are amended, the conditions of some types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Does it consider that the approval of this law is useful or that, above all, there is a burrocratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that it is.
The problem that can happen is that the rules are "induced" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
With the previous legislation, the persons controlled were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every non-complianced law in the field of public appropriations means violation of budgetary discipline.
Do you mean to endure the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or use it and do not punish those who do a formal failure, which has no incident in the decision-making.
A system of this type will only be able to create more burocratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this way starts.
The first minister has recently declared that ODS would not raise entrepreneurs with controls of the called SHvarc system, with reference to the fact that it is an autonome only on the role. What does this mean?
Is the shvarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in any manner and, if it is prohibited, then the first minister of the Government may not even prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and let it", but you can't say we'll do as if nothing.
In the public appeal law, legislation is strictly strict about how to act formally, and that is how to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer to not meet formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads present glass plates, although most of them are transitable
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads present ice and snow plates.
Although most of the ways are transitable, certain precautions should be extensive.
Karlovy Vary region
Tomorrow the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented glass and snow plates.
The temperature decreases and heats between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day, the thermometers will be slowly up.
He has left nest in the region and in the lower areas the neighborhood is finished.
Instead, in the Metalical Mountains the snow reaches nearly 30 centimeters.
In some places, the visibility was still bad because of the nest, according to the information of the centre of controlling the roads in the region.
The R6 fast road and the first category route in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended that extreme precaution, especially in some points of which surface can be heated and resbaled.
Also, all the second and third-party roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still wears with ice and fired snow.
It is necessary to increase the attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
In some East Bohemia roads there are dangers of helmets and in higher areas and in mountains can have been formed a nest swimming swimming snake on the roads, inform the Travel and Autopsy Directory on their pages.
Travel operators warn the dangers of ice plates, especially in higher areas in the pardubice region.
They can produce heats in the immediateness of Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlici, Poličky, Svitav or Möta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is especially snow on the mountain roads of Krkonoše to Orlické Hory.
There is a swimming cloud in the highest road areas in the towns of Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov.
In the East Bohemia area, the sky will be now between cutting and partly cloud, without precipitations.
Temperatures will generally be oscilated between three lower zero and a positive degree, and weak wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transit this morning, although the precaution should be extensive and will be adapted at time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be heats, the temperatures will swim between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the nest and after the decline of temperatures, some ways could also be covered with glass.
In some places, drivers will be found with novel, but visibility will be progressively improved.
This is what is outlined from the information from the Road Control Center in the region.
The D5 autopistor is almost transiable without restrictions, although the precaution is recommended, especially in the way between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most of the first category roads is seal and without glass.
In the street area of Pilesen and Tachov border with Germany, we may have brought with glass plates.
The second and third categories are humbled, so in this case, it also warns us with glass plates.
The drivers should be more careful, especially in the less transited ways in the Zhumava area.
Olomouc region
The drivers in the higher regions of the Olomouc region will be found in partly desired nest.
After chemical treatment, he was still sneeved in the port of śervenohorské and in the direction way to Videlský kśí.
The road operators left the snow during the night; at the road of Šumper were cumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to the travel administrators.
In the rest of the region, most of the ways are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Šumper road, there are rests of snow.
Conductors at the port of śervenohorské will be found with a medium-sized neck in direction to Jeseník," confirmed today an operator of the Šumper road administration to the  yangtK.
On the ground and at night they also accompanied Jesenická their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the pists of the highest areas are now shooted and shocked.
On the road of Olomouc, the ways are transitable without restrictions, the drivers should drive carefully in the forest trails, where the ways are still humed.
Usti nad Labem region and Liberec region
The operators of the northern Bohemia roads have informed about complications in different we take to the first hour of the morning.
Besides some places where he renewed or heated, according to the police data database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice is closed in the region of Usti Nad Labem.
Temperatures are maintained under zero, even in the lower areas, so it is obvious that ice and snow remain in the calzade. In turn, in the lower areas, especially in the south of the Czech Central Maciz, there are no problems and roads, generally, are secas.
There have been no service complications recorded.
Travel operators have warned the glass presence in the around of Štōti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected to rain and rain that swimms and the sky will be shocked and there will be ice.
Since the general roads have been announced disadvantaged conditions on road I/13, in the border between the Usti Nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that were covered on the road with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that at least one month will reach the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news that we like to shoot us.
To the music group The Tap Tap we like to do blooms about this and we like to say that we're the only group of music in the world that can meet enough positive energy to put the end of the world or to avoid it.
Furthermore, in December you will organize a real original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain to our readers?
This is a state blessing act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential that has the end of the massa calendar sentenced on December 21, at 11:10 morning.
On 20 December to 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Praga, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish about the same time when the massa calendar on the Kiribati island, in the Pacific Ocean, is about 12 hours before our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to him?
Initially it was my idea, and then we were forced the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to meet enough positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect together with society on the state where we leave the world to our children.
On the end of the KA calendar, we also created a unique collection of articles: boxes, shops, tastes, and original claws against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other interpreters, also sing the innocent call against the end of the world, which leads to the title “Fin of the world, Cancelated”.
It is currently very popular in YouTube, can you hear in the Beneficent Concerts?
Of course, yes, and it's just the last, well, until everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
They will sing them all the explanations at the same time in the three concierts.
The hernes will be linked to themselves simultaneously thanks to the special retransmission directly in the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the letter of this song and interprets Jesus's protagonist role in the videoclip, where he also songs Xindl X...
How did this cooperation happen?
We work together even with other personalities of the checa cultural scene, separately to organize many Benefit and Concert acts...
We make all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and you're glad to work with us.
What will the money recovered in the concerts against the end of the world?
Equipment for the educational center without the Studeo barriers, which we carried out in its sixth consecutive year with the Tap Civil Association in Jedličkåv cupstav.
The students from the school of Jedličkæv ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform pleasant and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and make us an easier to do so.
In the context of the completion of works in Jedličkуv cupstav, there will be an independent building to which we will be transferred with this project.
Each conciert acts several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We strive to develop a programme that is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will act in Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiōí Suchī.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May we will first act on the Praśské festival, so here we will certainly prepare an atractive programme with interesting invites.
The year that comes too would like to play in the Bohemian National Hall of New York and to me personally by using that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly minimumists, until now you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group formed by persons with disabilities.
How is logistic and organization of these trips?
It's not so difficult as you can look at first.
There are five members on electric shields, the seals have to travel to the apartment for equipment and also we have a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we have corrected them well. ✔SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surpriseing me.
Even in Moscow, where we returned a few days ago, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the outcome to the foreigner, it could compare the different attitudes of society to disabilities and other aspects.
What did you find you until now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in the east, there is a lot of ways to recur.
Unlike Prague, Moscú is filled with barriers, there is still no frequency that a person is moved alone by the center of the city in a seat of electric rounds.
It is, for example, something that is likely to give someone in the shields in the ascensor, there isn't it.
For happily, a civil partnership has been created that is striving to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
What aspects should we take to be the example of further countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going back...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on those who are directly affected.
In London and Madrid is very normal that people with serious disabilities are moved by their public account and can go to the service, to the museum, where they want to...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap Tap we have a little before!
A respectful or without barriers society is something, but when it comes to the moment where sports, artists, actors, political or lawyers will begin to change all the truth.
To now, they are isolated cases of people who have a great will force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we looked for a few years ago, what brought you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as a educationer in Jedličkæv cupstav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to devote to something.
And as I am musical, I touch, among others, the saxon, funding a amateur group with a working partner.
And with the time, as our moderator Láṣṭa Angelovič says, we were a little of the hands (rises).
However, popularity has not come to the last few years, or I am false?
It is true that it helped us to connect us with famous songs and also actively work to promote the group.
We concluded that the work that is not seen is like if it wouldn't exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also allow a teacher of quality, equipment, etc.
You intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, which can be done in another way.
The world of the spectacle is full of things that look to each other.
It is logically, in his way, all the new is welcomed with care and long too late to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I'm trying to say that the Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clear compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is fully superflu, because people with disabilities are not abandoned to suffer and to whom we should be compassionate.
There are people who are able to live in a full life and, of course, to have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then it is not only a progress for them but for all society.
Have you helped the fact that you are a demanding chief, as describes a lot of people?
If we want to do a quality work, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people arrive with a Romantic vision and with the head in the clouds, and when they know that they have to take two days to test, go to the preparatory test and passing long time traveling and concerts, the initial euforia quietly leaves them.
But this is how it works in all parts, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láæa Angelovič.
We're a open group, people enter and get out, they can't be avoided.
Whoever has will and wins will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Tuesday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
It will take place in the Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fleda and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musical groups of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected to the end of the velhice through videoconference to sing together the song of the Tap Tap Tap Group "Fin of the World, Canceled"
The objective of the conciert is to meet the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment from the STUDO educational centre without barriers in Jedličkáv cupstav of Praga, which costs 25 million Czech Koreans.
The entry to the conciert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the previous sale option in Bohemiaticket
Clamp? I got it clamped. Hold it.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twenty-fifth member of the ESSA. It is the second Member State of the ESSA of the former Block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland initiated intense cooperation with the ESSA in 1994, and during the years later participated in the Agency project commission.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began long ago.
Polish enthusiasms were already dedicated to flights to space before the Second World War, although they were not always understood.
I remember, for example, the A. Šternfeld conference in the Astronomy Observatory of Varsovia in which, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the unfair assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one that had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld obtained the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, became later a great impulsor of the astronomy and cosmonautic.
He published hundreds of articles in Poland magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promotor of the cosmonautic, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the clayers of the moon hidden face.
In 1925, a dryline was built in Poland which would be provided for a cohete engine.
Unfortunately, who was the author of the proposal, and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear if the cohete would be used for the start of the dryline or for its frened.
The information about this dryline is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933, Poland artillery began to dedicate the mixes.
The research was financed by the Comórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslam Wolfkem and Professor Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the conservated material, it is obvious that the investigation has come to the stadium of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, in the press specialized the prototype of a photo-electric mixer designed by the engineer Rohoziōski, and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna the raketobomba lolnicza", author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of motors for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the works.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautic appeared in the Poland press after the war thanks to the work of the Poland Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In November 1954, the magazine Problemy first refers to society with four very broad articles dedicated to the astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Subotowicze, was proposed to create a society that would be dedicated to cosmonatics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already started and it was obviously obvious that cosmic research was a disciplinary with future perspectives.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) aimed to form a part of the International Astronaut Federation (funded in 1951) and PTA became full member of that year.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was the Vice-President of the International Astronomy Federation.
He deployed this charge until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM sound cohete (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Poland cohete where a scientific research led.
The first type RM-1 was finished in 1957 and started first on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had an appeal of 1.800 meters, about 80 cm long and not reached 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 the air tests of the RM-2 cohetes were started in the wilderness of Bśdów.
The cohete was 1,4 meters and weighted about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development cohete would be a real scientific study. The RM-34 cohete would have a 14.5 km pharmaceutical support and its mission would control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The first cohete of the type RM was the Meteor-1 cohete, which was built during the 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as two stages cohete, with a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from the space available for scientific devices, were developed.
In the Meteor-1A cohete, the available space for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1965, the Air Institute was developed in the Meteor-2 cohete, the first airline tests started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had a initial weight of 380 kg and was able to take a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
Afterwards the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the National COSPAR Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland joined the Soviet Artist Satellites research and, in 1978, Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second inter-monau after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of social works law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional judge suspended social work law.
The resolution was a valuable discussion in society.
Since then, it will be interesting to consider the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal Economic Systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of a greater economic and less regulatory competitive.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and restricted private capital movement, together with the dismantled financial speculation.
The effect of the major differences in the work cost (loans) produces economic tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut distances, and to "propose a low" price of the competitor, with the aim of being made with the most part of the market, and thus increased its margin of benefits.
In large scale, for most employees, translating foreign production, buying there more costly or lost, the result is higher unemployment in countries where the price of the work is higher than other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with this, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state is essentially growing.
All of this situation provides the total interests of employees to pay taxes and compensate the economic and social damages caused by employees to benefit.
The situation is universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
In some economies, the poor-scale practices of private capital create situations in which Governments of those countries are able to competite with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly patented in changes of existing laws.
The aim is to bind the population to accept the opinion of the private capital, especially in terms of salary.
This is, on one hand, through the economic obligation system in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees regarding labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the increased differences between poor and rich.
Several years ago, there are food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot be maintained with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already coming to the million.
In the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, a sufficiently frequent case is produced: people employed with a salary as less that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
The situation of assistant employees of the German Federal Parliament was public.
Measures of almost all the Southern EU states lead to the same situation, and people who are stressed by an abysmal decline of their social level are obliged to migrate as in the 19th century, or to struggle with a slow wage in the border of society, with the hope that a day comes to the private capital inversor country.
Is it necessary to ask from where it comes?
In the case of other countries of the EU, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilians, Turkish, Morocco, Egypt or Africans continue to work in a large part of a European payment.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media declare that the state should not give capital to the economy, which leads the economy to its failure.
The private capital defends the test that the state should not be involved in the economy by controlling.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect its self-employment in political course and, indeed, in all the states.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbles, in the very powerful and all-presented practice in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reproveable in all parts but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is the following: state ministers, with the absence of financial means, are the drafting of laws to private legal undertakings which are often linked to the industry.
This type of law projects are adopted after the Federal Journal, the German Parliament.
Thus, all the non-Emanese power of the people, as it is announced in the Constitutions of West Democracy, is not the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obviously obvious that democracy with a liberal orientation will be found in a situation such as Appjanos in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of César and Pompeya: "The state was taking time disintegrated, and the administrations were occupied in force."
In change of soborns, benefits obtained illicitly and help to finance stones or swords.
Soborn and corruption were extended without any prevention, and people urned the urns with the premaried voice of premature... "No people had a nature to aspire to a position in the administration, so that once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without console"... "Prepared to speak seriously that the only means for such a serious situation was self-democracy and that it was necessary to choose a energetic man"...Agahanos thought in Pompeya, Caesar was under the power and transformed democracy forever in self-democracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, a decade of the eleite without previously, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the increase in fascists and communist regimes should therefore be seen in the dismantled liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and XX century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a determined suspension, at the expectation of the next stage.
The real democracy is that the current eleite is fully ignoring the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnesses, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of public appeal law is not the solution; at least not a long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue to search for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systematic.
The solution is conducted by concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen both the participation of the capital of the State and the influence of the citizens in the government and which deficiencies the position of the private capital in society in benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of the caos.
"It's nothing coming from violence and nothing ever could" (Noth nothing comes from violence and nothing could do), Sting in its Fragile song and whose strible resa "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (We don't forget of what we are).
"If my children don't want wars, there wouldn't be any." Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death leak in 1849.
After the last olive trees of violence between Israel and Gaza, different reactions have occurred as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defence and engages Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and claims racism by the state of Israel, the genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and taught Israel of terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on whom is guilty of the murders that are regularly repeated and who is the victim, and at the end and final, the citizens of today's day of Israel, including the autonomy territory, born within the current political situation and did not live the begins of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the phone, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been rounded for 95 years (called from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in a small land surface in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have arrived on the basis of my own way to understand the matter, about whom or what group of people are the main impulsor of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power fights is in the first line.
Each time we can find Alejandro Magno or Napoleon.
But what isn't already so obvious is whether these characters were those who directed their steps automatically or if behind his throne had someone who directed his actions towards a certain goal.
We should accept that we live in a time that concentrates the richness of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families highlights one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is someone back, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It is not written very close to them.
Of course.
In the 1990s of the 19th century, they purchased the first news agency (Reuters) to describe their name with crime acts of great seriousity. The power and richness, or both, would cover the swords, which for them always means strengthening.
They have major participations in almost all the world's central banks and in the countries where they are not represented, have been declared or prepared a war: before the attack in Afghanistan were seven countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, only four, but the Russian Central Bank has been removed to the Russian government.
Everything who tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the Session War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressist Louis Mc Fadden was inflicted in 1936 after he wanted to ask the FEF for having disappointed the great economic crisis in 1929.
His face through the world power led them during the 1859 - 1871s to make a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, condecorated with the level 33.
The first war was designed to eliminate the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second would want to remove the colonial suprême, especially from Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the population of the earth between a million and a million people (the same amount of slaves for their well-being and luxury, and they would not consume so many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (equamenism is nothing more than a project for such solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, continues to be the dynamic of crisis dischargement and the following offering a solution (order ab cao - order from the caos).
These solutions, however, are erroneous, and are always a deterioration of the situation. If not, enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heritage to the throne of Austria and Hungary, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the First World War was slaughtered, the Arctic Russia was destroyed by the start of the Burchevian Revolution.
The First World War ended soon and unjustly from the military and economic view, the heading of Germany (the wars to end with the Arctic Russian were already unnecessary) and the backward of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian-Hungary imperium.
To prepare the field of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a conflict on the basis of the huge war repairs on Germany, with the creation of the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the poorest mass. Afterwards, he founded them with the service of the German Führer, which was sufficiently strong and simple, and indicated to the guilty, and then built a Czecholovakia composed of a strong national minority that had to represent and represent the role of the Quintard, which took the Führer and called the stableness of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the foundation of the sionist movement, a raw that aimed at training a Jewish state, preferably in the ancient Jewish region with Jerusalem as capital (returned to Sion).
The previous Balfour declaration sent the basis for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were produced in both parties.
He established the Second World War: it is difficult to know whether Hitler had taken too much out of the currency to the international bankers in a principle or if everything was a part of a plan, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration fields created the best conditions for accepting the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, in similar ways, the war repairs set to Germany towards the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become victim of the first line of battle, now with the Arab population or, in general, the Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a large laboratory, a soldature and caos machine, not only in the framework of its country, but also at international level. We take example of the sharing of the sympathy and detractors of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engage in an unfinished spirit of violence, if at the beginning of all was the code of some individuals and its fat for the world's power?
In this regard, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandates, because, as is happening in our country, international bankers are only presenting their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist political, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything possible to declare the war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would be threatened to become a global conflict and, if we have taken into account that I will control the strike of Ormuz, where 20% of all the world oil (the navigation corridor has only two thousands of wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now is shown the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves to a pugnate of people who are part of well-commodated financial aristocracy.
A world where every new person is imposing a chip when he naked that controls all his being.
"And is obliged to all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or front, to not to buy nor to sell the name of this monster or the numbers of their name.
It is necessary to understand: those who have two front dents, which sums the numbers of this monster.
The number marked to the person and this number is six hundred and six."
Film Argo: If you get crushed, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students protested the American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as rehenses.
His release would be changed to the destronized shah Mohamed Reza Páhlevi, which after revolution fled to the U.S., country that had developed his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation would not offer any positive perspective: to remove shah from the border could not be allowed, as if he did, the confidence of its partners in other countries would in danger.
But the release of rehenses in Iran, where the revolution had been designed in the Constitution of the theocratic regime, was not at its scope.
It was a shock to the US prestige, which later further intensified with the failed attempt to release rehenses through the force.
The prisoners were released 444 days after the negotiative intervention of the Government of Argelia.
In the United States, his destination caused a sound of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the derogation of Jimmy Carter before Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" of the director and actor Ben Appleck addresses an episode of this story, which made a small success for America.
Shortly before busy the embassy, six employees were escaped.
After a complicated periplo, they ended in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, has helped them out of Iran to help a extravagant story covering: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the shift of a fictional science superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan of the expert in "Exfiltration" Toni Mendez requested Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the lie seems true, it was written about the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the physical production society had even a real dispatch.
The details on the operation remained secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memory.
The film of Appleck is a unique combination of several kinds.
On the one hand, a realist political striller; on the other hand, the story of a episode that went well, a lie (e.g. the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film we find well-documented sequences. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photos are shown in the time of events, which were plasmated in the film as well as in the same way; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are so much more liviane, marked by ironium and a weight exageration.
And also, scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions: men who have been trapped to analyze the situation in the negotiations table, on the office passes, by phone...
Ben Appleck has been able to restart your cart in a excellent way.
The actor, who had been objected of burls, has become a respectable director and its way of action has stopped being white of iranic comments.
Argo is his third long-term, after "Best-bye, Good-bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. Ladrones City" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film of Appleck where the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that was located in the directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Appleck shows it in Argo, where Tehe will become "ruda" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film are placed on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive for its symptoms that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of unconsciousness and the lack of warning that happens when, at any time, the story gives a step forward.
Appleck and their collaborators have similar effects on the physical scenes (the imposing team in the Teheran's bag).
Many action in too many places
The director had to accept that an explanated history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it's quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here you don't get everything so elegant (the scene in which the crisis in the airport of Teheran, the division of a call to America, and the search of discharged after your track becomes a crazy).
Argo's flag is the discontrolled need to show deteriorate action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very pleasant role as Hollywood's collaborators, although their characters are more than space and are not, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the film of Appleck loses a little dramatic trace, but it is a movie that can be followed with a moderate interest, assessing its realization and the back style of a thriller that calls the 1970s.
But it's gonna be hard.
As a vocational history and a evidence of the exagerates that may be the ideas of ominity and omnisticness of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for global inflation, bananas and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which presents an annual investigation on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absolute regulation or ideas of EU Taller".
"If we have occurred after the last event, the EU has intended to adopt a share of 40 percent of women in large European companies in direction positions", explained Prävo Patrik Suer, the investigator of the survey.
Through the named absurdness, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to harmonize the insurance proliferations between men and women.
Eventually, women had improved prices in life insurance because they are objectively representing a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas of the EU Taller can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," reported Nacher.
The EU's contraventional regulations, for example, are the obligatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; the other prohibition is the use of the mercury terms of all life only because they contain a small amount of dangerous substance or the shadow of the size of galleries, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factical prohibition to use the expression "mantequilla of untar" or the removal of the classic trade bomb was criticized.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union device takes this type of decisions often under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose applications in Brussels are normally defended by any state or group of states (Czech Republic, including by the veto threat, reverse the requirements of their banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality platforms should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "anormal curvature".
The European Commission was defended by saying that this is only trying to harmonize the non-homogeneized national standards until the date, which only complicated its marketing.
The standards which refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been underlined on the basis of the existing directive contained a deterioration of commodities.
The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU last year that in inflable globals that are marketed is obligation to warn that 8-year-old children are not allowed to inflate them without supervision of adults.
The EU refers to a American study that, when we talk to games, globals are the main cause of child death by asfixia.
A similar restriction for the use of mortality by children up to 14 years is also enormous.
Interesting events born even in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: any who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To do not hurt Greece's sensitivity, it must be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the partnership of liberal economics Laisses Faire, appointed in the survey, among some above-mentioned advertising proposals, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supply in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supply that can be found on the Territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry to the EU.
Then the Czech Republic exceed, for example, the volume set for seeds in conservation, with a threat to substances.
The organizations of the survey also interested them in paying the countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention for the request of subsidies.
This kind of ideas occurred not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're in a depreciation for the fact that we don't have a sea.
We requested the European Union a compensation", said in August 2004, the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (~SSD).
He argued that in our country much cereal was produced and, as a result of the intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and was to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the sea ports, the EU should pay for hundreds of euros.
Finally, the European Commission has been prepared to help the Czech Republic and has organized a public complaint for the purchase of the cereals of countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidiary for a subvention was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development addressed by Minister Pavel Nśmec (US-DEU) and is specifically intended to address Brussels' subventions applications.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often white of critics, EU policy efforts and, as well, more effective functionality and development in the whole Union, are better worth our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the EU's subsidy cover for projects which have nothing to do with the deep integration of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also touchs the sensitive fiber as well as other countries of the Union, the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victory of these pugnals.
The Cheques, after six years of discussions with German and Austria, successfully defended the name of origin of Olomouc requence, but had to change her name to the national king, whose tradition in our country was retreated to the 19th century, and passed to be called "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cancer distilled can be called ron, but not those from sugar relief.
In the official list of protected origin names of the EU, together with the fat and gorgonzola shoes known throughout the world, the Shupan of the German city Lübeck or Parma's shoes, for example, are already found in the Karlovy Vary gallets, the carp of Pohośelic and Tśeboō and, including, the variety of luxury.
As protected seas from the EU, they may be proud of the Pardubice's bread and the ships of Hośice v Podkkkronoši.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an afect, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did the elections have been submitted to the President?
It is not the Senator of the President.
If in our country it was good, I would not present my candidate.
But I can't see how it is robbed in the last twenty years of our country, how ladders are impunished, taxes and age of jubilation are increased.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And since I have forty years and my candidate is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present me as a senator or President.
The Senado has already arrived, but soon it was put on the way to the presidency.
Does it not give the shoes to those who have voted it?
I always said that my candidate to the Presidency was depending on the results in the elections of the Senate.
I later predicted that if I was elected by Senator, I would submit my candidate to the Presidency.
But my goal is not the role; the function is the tool with which I can make reality of my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the most strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize on the bar or front of the television, but we stood anybody who wanted to start a change.
This is the means of communication, which deprecise you and confusion the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie.
It is said I was soborn to journalists that I was advised by Jiśí Paroubek.
We'll talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle is presented with financial tests and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property for more than twenty million.
To that end, the law must be changed.
As President, he does not have this competitiveness, and only the senate in its whole may propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressures that would be recognized as an autonomous work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in the policy: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either right or left, it is rejected in order and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain support of all Parliamentary groups.
Without matching or dogs, I have the ability to choose anything from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Does a right man or left man better be considered?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It's not important for me, it's already a little left or a little right.
What I care is that we get out of here.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to join people.
Always openly support any good solution, independently whether the proposal comes from KSṣṭM or from the ODS and, in the same way, will be against the bad ideas.
It's broke when you say it's popular.
But isn't he showing it with what he says?
When a business plan is created, you also have certain objectives and ideal objectives.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it popularism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the Parliament's support, there is only a sign of it.
And so it cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you are leading to people and talking to them, will you, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them out of my part to get it.
If the President was elected, there would be no problem to organize a direct television retransmission in which the leaders of the parliamentary parties would ask to legitimate the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and taxes of the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person that indicates the debates, it is possible to make pressure on the political scene.
We take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I'm just a aged, I'm not a genius or intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to search for partners.
I've just started in the policy and I'm trying to get the most possible support for my program.
I'm trying to get out of the way, but if I don't go well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no salvador.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I have visited a number of known personalities, so if the best is that they are encouraged to submit their candidate to the Senate.
I saw Radin Jančura, but he refused because I had a lot of work.
For me, at least, I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencova, who blew the fraud with low heat oil.
I was present from the basis that people are really unconscious, now I'm in the balance.
The sixty percent of the population did not listen to the urins and, those who did it, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the senate, we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of alcalds or rulers.
Do you consider sharing your own game?
I have not yet considered it because I have no time for that, to check the untailable past of each of the potential members of the party, and I have no money.
I have no money or for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 Koreans.
You don't have money?
She's talking about the ownership statements, how's your?
I think my private property in about 60 million.
In Praga I have a terrace valued in 25 million, a valuable floor of ten million, another floor decreased in eight million, a collection of art works with a value of ten million, a Aston Martin of about 3,5 million and a superb skoda valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
Indeed, I have a Aston Martin because he was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drived this car, was galaxy with women and, at the same time, fighting against the evil and injustice.
Guide a Aston Martin, your property is valued in 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic but you don't want to put too much money from your side.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to blame me?
I've already put 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you have no patrocinator shows that there is no too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with the money of my bottle.
The expenditure of the campaign covers in origin what was received in the concept of senator lounge.
For example, I couldn't pay you my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly coronas.
If I would only want to win money, then I wouldn't present me as a candidate.
So you will continue with your business activities to live?
Did you not say before I left this activity?
This has nothing to see with a biggest salt.
As I promised, partly I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People wanted to be the Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much will you win monthly as a entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 to 400,000, I still win.
If I was President, I would leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book Montagne" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is pleasant, has a futurest aspect, and finally there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a cross-end that pass through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, T-technician in a large company near the library, points out: "Adam, the building is beautiful."
But I ask why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody's income in those mode libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city situated at the doors of Róterdam, which just worth a visit, obtained the doubtful honour to have been held with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people represents the lower Alphabetization rate of the Netherlands.
To oppose this so honourable situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general culture and to copy the seven fixed points that appear in the euros in the form of armed hormigion miniatures.
The success of the offensive education was limited.
And so the political responsibilities decided that there was only a possibility to improve statistics: did it have to build a library?
Winy Maas, from the Dutch Architecture Studie of MVRDV, all a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsibilities of chanical buildings, took the topic with its usual sweetness and composed the presentation of the concours in 2003 with five books under the arm and a dream on the face.
And while the jury looked around, and he was shocked by shadows, Maas tried to smile the books in size, forming a pyramid and concluded his short discours with the words: "Stimated conciliated:
Here, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, named 'Boekenberg'.
9 years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is up on the planned place.
This form is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a subterranean packaging, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of household buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was galled with the second Best Library of NL 2012.
Furthermore, the project is also appointed to "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small town of history, which until the date had nothing more than offering a posmodal peatonal area and an incredibly shooting after which white shoot one would intuite better a milk central, now with a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of his history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a question.
Well, there is a ascensor that transports us just to the center of this sweet mountain, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to be funding with their topography at each step of their scale to the top.
The totally grown inside is light and easy to shoot with view, the floor of the recognised ladder, and the elegant faulas are incorrectly supporting the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
On the top of the view, you can see the park banks, the dogs, and the kids and the girls playing the football.
And on all sides of books, books and more books.
"That book stars are normally available throughout the facade, and in the center it is opened a large dark room that usually be something unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classical space configuration and get out of the internal reading area.
The inside of the mountain is very well used: the offices, the internet library, the agedrez club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the middle.
Special mention mere the black stars living in the wall, paraped and barandilla functions at the same time.
The view, the tacto and the oil are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers at the day know the head when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with reciclated materials", explains Josop Trouborst, the head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is like a day, in a cold agricultural exploitation, we spend with the appropriate subproduct from the agriculture.
For many years, in winters and in the Netherlands's fields, a plastic tissue of low-scale millimeters is used as a basis for subjecting the roots of the cultures.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue ends up two stations and then goes away.
For the library, this tissue was taken, for the first time in such quantities, until reaching four centimeters of speed.
With heat and pressure, the named agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that slows to a new car mixture and sports slipilla.
After 105 kids, it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, almost 500 meters around the mountain waits for the reward: from the coffee it is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy some Dutch crochet sacks and its planted fibers in a huge macets.
These create a pleasant environment to maintain the appropriate atmosphere humidity for this literature mountain.
Donations for a new soul
"If you want to believe that given its large increased surfaces, this building is an exemplary project on ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heat and refrigeration are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books it is located under a huge cristal pyramid, even in the most solar days the sun is only lighting for a few hours in its interior.
The vast wood strikes situated in transversal sense to the crystal facade serve to give shadow and absorpte most of the sun rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest of the automatic persianas.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker of the Information Technology Sector, has already been strict to put the feet into the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, the traditional physician professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifys the "Boekenberg" as the "the late" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the people of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
This is how it is intended to fill the optical shoes of a library that is still not counting with its complete file; in the present time there are 70,000 examples.
The concept is calmed.
The stars are filled.
"There is nothing worse than a medium library," the architect Winy Maas says.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to be drunken.
Thus, the MVRDV study has achieved a whole success in this reign discipline that is known as "Creation of a Identity".
The city of Spijkenisse wrote a part of the history of literature.
Independently from the youth and inculture that may be.
Finally, a start point to comply with its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role."
Germany has been abstented in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the relations between the United States and Europe, this is located in Berlin in a lowly diplomatic position.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories the condition of observer of the United Nations.
However, finally, Berlin was abstracted.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I think that nor supports the North American posture.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany was also abstracted when the process was to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This has been finally declared by the NATO.
Is it difficult to Germany to adopt a clear post when they are playing important international issues?
Yeah, yeah.
This should be the reorientation of its external policy in these times, with a leading policy, thus say by the United States and focusing on a German external policy.
And what is still more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Consequently, the Germans are in an enclosure.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not habituated to do it.
I believe that they are still slowing their role, but they have already started the way towards a "normal" external policy.
A external policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What specifically means a "normal" external policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that is available to defend different posts from the United States or its European partners when it is national interests.
I think German external policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Next East.
German economic interests are even different than those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the post-adopted conflict in the next East and the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the next East, especially in the Golf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not aligned from the Arab public nor of the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give him so important because it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, there is a fundamental role in the German consideration.
Has Germany understood his relationship with the United States when not to vote in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe, and even in the United States, the German posture enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that such a dramatic rupture has been produced as in Libya.
Maybe with that Germany has achieved a certain respect.
At the end and at the end, all of this has not been done but showing that it is a country that takes seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly shown for a vito.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of the United States internal policy.
I believe that the Obama Government is a secret understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend this post in public.
I believe that the real difference of opinions does not actually have the invergence assigned to it.
If we analyze the relationships between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for nothing enthusiasmed with the development policy.
Is Germany difficult to conciliate close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the posture of their main partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what it makes to be so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more easy for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of an overwhelming entity, but must stimulate things from their own position.
That is exactly what you are doing with the euro now.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a role of leadership at the time of forced Europe to take a European posture.
Of course, this is not nothing easy for Germany, not just for the relationship to be maintained with Israel.
This has always been a pleasant theme.
But I think the Germans have clearly to play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see himself in the role of an international actor? Do you really want Germany to take a protagonist role?
Or may it continues to be difficult to accept this leadership?
Germany has not yet been accumulated, has always been uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as the main actor, some anti-aleman feelings are disabled.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is a old problem and is that no one wants to be around the enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a very harder position than the United States.
A receptive attitude should be shown towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The impact of the US policy is increasingly reduced, but the EU does not cover that empty, who then remains?
The Germans will not remain more remedies than taking a more protagonist role.
Even if you don't like them, if they are unpleasant or become them more unpleasant, it's life!

"Marke Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly converted into Chinese brands
Armania is a well-known world mark and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a officially registered name in China is hidden but has nothing to see with the original companies.
However, this goal of protection is while true epochs do not submit a request.
And even then it is not clear that you will give them the reason.
"As foreigners are more difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer attorney of the Taylor Wessing buffet specialized in protection rights violations in the East.
Each week comes to my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and is registered in place of Prada-Kny.
German enterprises are also legally copied as it has occurred to the manufacturer of sports items Puma.
Pattloch opens a architect in which you sit from the Peking Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma mark, a artificial name that also served from the model house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chineses are world-wide champions in which they can copy and violate intellectual property rights are well known.
In the large cities there are large stocks of various plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsification.
However, Pattloch's cases are otherwise in the field. As a result of its customers, he fights against the fact that the mark office has been officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name already registered in another place.
The Chineses call it "Bang Ming Pa" or a matching mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "beating" to a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful for business, it's got to fight against it," says Pattloch.
"The brand makes water, monopolist position disappears and the damage that suffers the image is great."
Financial losses and processing costs of the affected sectors are thousands, especially in the case of luxury emblems.
According to the CLSA market analysis company data, with a volume of EUR 15,000 million per year, the third market of luxury items is in size and the increased rhythm.
However, the cancellation of duties in the mark registration is complicated, and it also provides much money.
The processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a request because he had passed so long that the name objection of the query had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has bad luck, it may even have to pay money to the plagiant because the process has damaged the mark of it in China," says Pattloch.
At times this is the wild law.
Some of the most known cases have to see with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a plot against the Sany machine manufacturer, the company which has been absorbed by the German manufacturer of putzmeister hormigon bombs.
So today, Chineses can continue using a very similar emblem of Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, first used a white and blue logo that recorded largely BMW; the matter was addressed to the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste Steel manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo type represented a cocodrile which was opposed to the original direction.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Peking recognizes that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lowness of staff equipment and supply.
Last year, however, "the situation of labour emergency returned to normality".
Thus, the amount of untramited claim processes has been reduced to 22 per cent.
About 57.000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims continue to be resolved.
Trust this costs a lot of money
As normally in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million mark protection applications, almost a third more than 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China will lead for a tenth year to the list of new inscriptions throughout the world, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logs, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.800 million yuans had been borrowed in the concept of rights.
In other words, this means that the average of each registration costs EUR 1,280 yuans or EUR 160.
Playing this costs a lot of money, as shows the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the group fights in courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illicit manufacturing of pieces of imitation,
the imitator has been able to ensure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"We themselves have caused this situation because the callers are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Consejero delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Marks office also dismissed the resource of municipalities.
In the following two instances, they gave you the reason to Freudenberg, but the opposite party would continue to fight today.
There must be a lot of care
The case has now arrived to the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains a resolution.
Wentzler trusted in ability to resolve the issue and endorsed the professionality of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the entrepreneurship archive had to review exemplary from up to 100 years of anti-government to provide tests.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the contrary to a "sum of six figures in euros" to reach a friendly agreement but did not succeed.
"This shows the importance of us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Middle East are threatened by affecting Europe,
specifically if the imitators are assured there the rights on non-protected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products in Germany.
Since the group left this trade area, however, it has been able to prevent the registration.
"I need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and the lawyer Pattloch recommend the German companies that are very careful at the time of business with China.
It is not enough to trust in the international mark rights legislation, but that what we need to do is "register in China also everything that might be likely to be protected", such as Wentzler.
On the contrary, the topic may be much more precious than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg loses the last assault of his special battle, then the party would have to pay the contrary license rights for its own name, as explains Wentzler.
That or in the sector concerned would exit us from the market.
World Day of fight against AIDS: dance, song, help
In Heidelberg, the Coro Imbongi and Suaziland teaches the AIDS orphans
The history of a link able to overcome over 8,733 miles away.
First it starts by the dance: cowboy bottles, bathrooms, tacon shoes and mocasins are looking for the coma on the parquet ground, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then they start to slowly higher the voices of the skins (control, low, tear and above), rhythming, smiling, and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to order his powerful and sweet shoes.
It is Monday and Monday in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Institute, the Coro Imbongi presses a new song.
The 50 songs, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from human genetics to home love.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy piece, each coro voice has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: the Zulu, a language speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botsuana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Suaziland.
Help for auto-help
According to UNAIDS estimates, the United Nations AIDS fighting programme is about 34 million people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Suaziland there are 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seroportive.
The Voices for Africa's association has been found in Germany for the 180 orphans of the AIDS people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend to the secondary school.
By 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be discovered.
This contribution will cover the school matrix, the uniform and will ensure a warm food day in the Gogo Center.
Imperialization means "historal narrator" or "panegirist".
In this room nobody knows speaking fluidly with this swimming language, but sing yourself.
Since ten years ago, this coro sings in this foreign language that, in occasions, it is possible to transport them to their origin: South Africa.
At 8.733 km from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Suaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German king.
The quarter per cent is infected
About 2.000 people live there, some still in simple shoes of bar and shoes, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no longer parents because they have sucumbled AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the higher AIDS infection rate and the lowest life hopes in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has proved to be reduced to half the county risk.
More than 40 per cent of the people in Swaziland are the portators of immunodeficiency virus, and the death of some 30 years has become a normal thing.
During a joint journey to Africa in spring 2005, the coro discovered this recruited population, but what had seen most of them were children in the streets that lacked not only from the protection of their parents but also of the main part: food, clothing and training.
Without school, the possibilities in a poor country are more than less.
In a principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that could make a child out of the college and enjoy a warm food on the day.
However, a year later the Coro found the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been professionally occupated by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Data on sexual transmission infections
What are the main sexual transmission diseases?
Between the bacterial origin STS are syphilis, clamide and gorine.
The most common viral origin TS are AIDS, human papiloma virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The chairs and the salt are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected persons?
Syphilis and genders are more often given in men who maintain sexual relations with others.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of gender transmission diseases, the most common sexual diseases are clamed, triconones, human papiloma virus, candidiasis (Humanity) and gorinea.
HIV contagious among the adults of the country is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Between young people, climate infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three four of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In our country, human papiloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to a binding declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections had twiced its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections maintains a descendant trend since 2007.
In 2011, some 2,700 cases were registered.
This is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a veterinary disease?
Infectional diseases can cause ulcers in the genetic area, orinary molesties, flux, abdominal pain, ampolles or torment.
They often do not cause pain, nor cause other symptoms, and therefore they are not detected.
How can a man protect?
Conservatives can reduce the risk of contagious, but they do not provide protection to 100 per cent.
Some pathogens of sexual transmission diseases may also be transmitted through suicide and physically contact.
For this reason, experts recommend to be regularly subjected to medical reviews, especially if sexual partners are changing frequently.
If you are diagnosed prematurely, most of the ETS may be curated and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through cooperation, donations and, finally, but not less important, the honorarys that cover the core for their actions in all Germany have come to recur enough money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says the proud Annette Lennartz, the President of the Association.
In the own people of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and with leadership dots manage the money sent from Germany.
Orphans find a good accommodation, for example one of the grandmothers.
The "goods", as the older women in Zulu, are the people's pilars.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a kitchen where they live, and they take care of children at school every day at time and clothes with their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman, which, as both kitcheners are responsible for kitchening every day for more than 200 hungry children, results in a salary of the association.
Furthermore, "Vuces of Africa" has set up a coast school, has built two galleryers and, in collaboration with the US Health Organization, has achieved that many people have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not obvious because, despite the patent that this disease is in the whole country, it is not usually openly talking about it.
A king with 14 wifes
"Aids are a absolute table," Annette Lennartz says, "for you have to see sexuality."
There is something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wifes.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its opulent life style and fulfilment of excess.
Poligamia instead of democracy.
This formally not accepted life is mostly responsible for the propagation that has experienced HIV virus in the past decades.
However, it must also be the innumerable temporary recurrence of the country from one side to another, where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any scene you can get free conservatives, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept the piel contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Corn Imbongi travels every two or three years from South Africa by songing songs speaking of melancoly, combating spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the most Southern African continent are still remembering the time of apartheid.
A white bus filled with songs in a black language; so recognition is not only bringing with me a excellent environment and much joy, but has also been able to launch a couple of laughs to some of the other rabieous border soldiers.
The trip always brings them to Esitjeni, where the songs visit the disadrished children.
Despite this small population only appears in the maps, the Ezulweni river is very well known.
"Return to Esitjeni, there lights the light," states the people of the place.
And after turning 8.733 km online back to Heidelberg to the test rooms of the Bergheimer Street full of songs marking the step, one is accounted that it is also possible to see the light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger Son has found evidence of the ice existence in Mercurio.
Probably the glass hair has a sperm of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North America Space Agency, has produced evidence of the ice existence in Mercurio.
Despite treating the nearest planet on the sun, there is also heat water, as it is out of three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine “Science”.
The Messenger Son would have found evidence that in the planet area that is permanently located in the shadow has been formed a glass helmet.
It seems to have at least 30 cm and probably even up to 20 meters of speed.
Water is presumablely produced from commodities or, with great probability, of asteroids that in their day shocked against Mercurio.
Nobody relates to the ice finding with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says the chief researcher of the Messenger study, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees centigrated.
However, findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have arrived to other areas of the sun system.
In full unconverted way for the people of the Earth, the sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.
Always when they send images to the Earth: small windows to the majority of space.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers of the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that meet our solar system, in addition to the Ceres planet.
Like Pluton, which turns around the just sun behind Neptuno, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomic Union in 2006 Ceres is not any "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "familiar radar" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficulty to recognise is the red color of the "recent born stars".
This region of star training, called unromantly by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope on the Casiopea constellation, at a distance of 6.500 light years.
This image returned from an extinction star was taken by the NASA's telescope Spitzer.
The ring in the form of donut is composed of the material that the star spends in its extinction process.
In the vast Trifide Nebulosa, at 5.400 years of Earth, new stars are formed from gas and powder.
The NASA Spatzer telescope took this photo from the galactic star training area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Hermans", are a simple viewed object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, you can better appreciate the colours.
The Nebulous of the Helize appears as a great red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located at 700 years of light of the Water Constellation.

One of the largest and most nice photos taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Remolino Galaxia.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spirit galaxy become true art works.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifide Nebulous situated in several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagitario.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), since some dark powder lines share the weird heart of this stereolar training area in three lobules.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronoms could picture the indications of a cosmic character: at 400 million light years of Earth the two galaxies in the fusion process are shocking one to the other to end shocking unremeditablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the Espiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abreviations can refer to it with the overname of Molinillo Austral.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the Nebulosa Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebulous situated at 1.400 years of light is composed of powder particules whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than the powder particules we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographies made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black rings situated in 430 million light years of the Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for the NASA Space Telescope Hubble.
Scientists call the larger espiral galaxy of UGC 1810.
In this nebulous there is the most brilliant young star group of our Lactea view.
This star training area constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Nebulous Roseta, also constantly emerged new stars; at 5,000 years of Earth light.
In this so brilliant galaxy there is no powder, only gas.
The investigators suggest that a few days after the big shuttle, when the universe could be found about all hydrogen.
Our universe window: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei would use it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the spectacles of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images offering us have more deeply.
During the 30 years, in particular from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale situated in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His eye, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the Binocular Telescope is highlighted.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two spectrums, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Great Telescope Canarys located on the island of La Palma is great - only the shoe has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The spot of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmentated to spend costs.
Despite that, there is a diameter of about 11 meters.
The inconvenient of this more economic building is that the telescope has a fixed higher angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed height angle.
Your personality is your huge ability to collect light.
Despite counting with a relatively smaller speed diameter, this capacity is equipped with the largest spectrum telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Radio Telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestreat life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "External Intelligence Search Search" (SETI) can help any person who has a computer, providing processing capacity.

The Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four spectrums, this telescope can also light the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also welcome the named E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope Extremely Great).
The primary spectrum will be 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1.000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to take images.
Up to 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaii Hawaii volcan of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They contain two spectrums, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea, it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a spectrum diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
From April 24, 1990, I sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for extra-sollar planets, mainly those living.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission had been placed 1.235 planets.
The image is seeing the last preparations before the Kepler space telescope launching.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched at board space from Ariane 5 to 2018.
The primary spectrum of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will find the light of the first stars and galaxy formed after the big round.
The investigators are part of the basis that there are glass in the south pool of Mercurio.
However, there are no fascinating evidence, since the Messenger survey turns around the planet in a very closer orbit to the northern pool.
Since decades the radar measurements point to the existence of glass in Mercurio.
Thanks to the Messenger Son (2004), the first orbited around Mercurio, now scientists are sure that it is.
Drink a day and live 168 years

Search for shoes in a country where 97 years old are still considered young.
The rear by the mountain region of Talysh could be qualified by salvage and romantic.
The minibs continues with great stress through the slight road that goes next to the wooden shoes, the rivers of great cattle and the simple houses of the local farmers.
Everything is green and sweet, one could even think it's located in the Black Sea.
However, we are located in the southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is situated just a few miles away.
Here they live the "talyshi", a people that is not well known, unlike they dominate perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city presses an architecture maybe too massive designed in the Soviet era and that doesn't seem to be shocked in a so-called mountain landscape.
European tourists only arrive to this place, because the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too weak.
To recur the 323 km separated by both urban nuclears, eight hours are needed because the road is one sense.
The wonderful richness of which the country enjoys thanks to the Caspio sea oil has not yet arrived in this rounded region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to make it a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and the next year we will celebrate the festival of the elderly people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only part of the world.
Here is documented the life of eight decades of Tayshis from the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a white and black image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years old.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the unconscious star of the museum is the pastor of Shairali Muslumou sheep, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth game that certificates it.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years old, it seems that the age of Muslumou is quite suspected.
"He born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married in three times and had 23 children. When she seemed to have still had time to design a daughter more than 136 years old.
Have Siirali Muslumo been wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in Rostock's Max Planck Institute, has also heard of the advanced age of this population in Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very advanced people," said Scholz, "incl. in Cerdeña there are many older men."
Because of the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum if there is no civil registration.
Each day full swimming swimming snacks
It is a fact that, in a surprising frequency, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik are often reaching a Bible age.
Today there are 20 people who exceed 100 years of age.
Why live here, in the south, so many advanced age people?
Azeri Tourist Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause is in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logically that precisely the rich nutrition in the calories of the Tayshi, who love the flesh, the bread and especially all milk products, and many of which, moreover, are daily drinking a dereted mantequilla vase, being so healthy.
Or may be the form of natural life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small village not far from Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
97 years of age is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical tree house of the whole Caucasus region.
Sit on the ground, move in an incantable way a huge twin of mantel.
Eight people live under a teeth, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandmothers long ago.
They also play on one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen, they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in some typical vases with ambassade shape.
The dentists of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the puzzle hidden two long dark smile treasures that his son discovers us proudly.
I've always laid my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and maintained your color.
"I have never used a champion", says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eating only what he had produced in his own farm: tomates, patates, and guests.
In my whole life, I never went to buy a supermarket.
Then he talks about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his castle when the "sweet father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in mouth of a older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, who directs his country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in the power until 2003, at the time when the Witness blinded his son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manit (approximately the same amount in euros) in a monthly pension concept, a amount that can be lived well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the channel son of Mirzayeva has the right: "The older are very respected in our culture."
Living in a great family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
Like if this wasn't enough to keep life with many years...

Manifestations that reevaluate among themselves in the Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is summoned.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is very controverted.
The Egyptian President did not ruin into patientism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is what happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," said in public television.
His speech would be addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian cops, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, assembled unmediately until now in a confuse opposition, have fear.
I am afraid of a theocratic to the Nilo's oceans for the grace of the powerful Islamic community.
As Mohammed Mursi explained, almost asking for forgiveness, he had had to temporaryly cancelle the competences of the Constitutional Court and extend his "to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know well what this 61-year-old engineer really wants to save a doctorate title by the South California University.
Do you want to free your power to judge?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a representative assembly of 100 representatives predominantly Islamic members at a night meeting of 15 hours, are really concerned.
As in previous constitutions, the borrower also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principes of Islamic law".
But what does that mean "principes"?
This was and continued to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamians will use this vague formulation, as well as the legal handling margin that appears, to place a more strict interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what it suggests a new article added: in all issues relating to sharia, it is obliged to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a great power in the entire Sunic Islamic.
It is not so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, which - in fact - would have resulted in the incapacity of the judiciary.
A large part of the Constitution abolitor is open to the interpretation
What also results in problems is that it intends to keep the military courtship.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak, these courts served to exercise a deep repression on opposition.
After the dictator's chair until 11.000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the borrower sets, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and values".
This is a very important formulation in legal terms that the State institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature with the aid of this article.
It is clear that it is nothing else than censure.
Indeed, no article provides explicit equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibition of abuse or calumniation to the prophet Mohammed and his legends.
However, it is not clear what it is a abuse and how it is to be sanctioned.
Similarly, it is the formulation prohibiting the "opposition to people"
Is it enough to load the President or a chat on a reader?
Interpretation question, as well as many other things in the slaughter that has been submitted to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "more soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The Revolution has come back"
Last weeks the opposition is shutting lines against the superiority of Islamics.
Ten thousand people gathered in an inusual harmonity on Wednesday evening in the Chariot's Tahrir Beach and pleaded to fail the Act before they could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up overcoming", says Hamdin Sababai, who is the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel of the Peace and Director of the International Atomic Energy Organization, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the Constitution's burner should be "in the cloud of the store".
On Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers to want to lead to a "state golf against democracy".
"When the referendum convoques, we'll go to his palace and we'll cut it", says the opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not angry, the blood of our brothers have not yet been overlooked," was quoted in the Egyptian media to the opposite politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so they would not be considered valid.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
For its part, the well-organized Islamic community called to celebrate a contra-manifestation; for it is not in the Tahrir Beach, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nilo, to the University of El Cairo.
Many women covered with a speed and partisans of salaphists took part in the same cry of: "The people require the application of God's law".
They requested Mursi "Clear the country," at the same time they proclaimed: "the Coran is our Constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the Symbolic Place Tahrir, where it started all, had caused a similar situation of civil war.
It is obviously that the Mursi Partyers did not want to argue that something would happen.
Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the abolitor of the Constitution and the parties of the same would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide in the urnes what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the abolitor of Islamics has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have longed up to February and included all social forces.
The lawyer of 48 years of specialized in human rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were arrested or had to face a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak.
It was not because he shared his ideology, but because human rights are invisible for him.
For this reason it was shocked, convicted and incarcerated.
"And now the expression "Human Rights" does not even appear in the new Constitution," is regretted in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's competence to the three powers of the State made that the lawyer was resigned.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the democratic game rules and will bring Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is abolishing it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is holding at the Nilo's oceans with a mixed of curiosity and tension.
This could be back in your opposition.
A manifestant in the Tahrir Beach warns: "You're getting a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian Rafisk: Is the most malliest fishing in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the largest living levels, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country holds some relationships with its awareness for a very malicious fishery?
Take a series of excessively curated cheeses.
Put them in the midst of a swimming and humed swimming mountain.
I'm there a week.
Then you can listen to the aroma paralyzing of the rakfisk, one of the Norway's exquisitives.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, at 3 hours of Oslo.
It's sweet. The landscape is spectacular, and that oil, always present, is flewed in the air.
The rakfisk is a storm in salt that leaves to ferment in water during, depending on the malligence you prefer it up to a year.
As the dark and going to make more cold, the Norwegians are in tropical accumulation to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this manner of the most, so say, cautive.
"See as crude and then drink a aquavit vase of a trageon," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomb of the city, who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", which is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fishing that is guarded in small cubes and drinking a significant amount of drinking.
"A few people like the aquavit than the rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the hole.
I've tried some strikes.
If you can avoid passing near the narrow, it's not bad; it's not very different from a part of sushi that has recruited some kilometers in bus.
Raffisk is a product from a very different time, in which poverty was norweged and in which, before it was cold, fishery was guarded during the otonium summered in water and salt in hermetic barriles.
Later, in full winter, when it is well fermented, it is out and, obviously, is eating with the inactive sense because of alcohol.
Only one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in the search for work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is rapidly increased; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, which are affected by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full social service system.
A flow of Sweden, the old rival and even too richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rafisk is considered something important, a major part, although quite malile, of the past of Norway.
It is among the cheapest plates that can be purchased.
But, in fact, it's worth. A bird skin or a sandwich cares for you with the 10€ ($14).
Norwegia does not usually appear in the agenda of international news and most norwegs like that.
Here the people are still poor to speak the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist that shooted and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shoot as "the occurrence of July 22."
The Norwegians are very costing to believe that in their calm country one of them was able to do such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current riches in Norwegia, the growth, from the beginning of the 1970s, of one of the larger oil and gas industry in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our cousin, while it's going to pass rakfisk bands and that, with its long ruby mele and its surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, aware people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impossible.
"We don't like to expand, we don't like obtention."
Norway has managed its oil riches with a lot of cattle; but except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While the whole world disappointed money that I had not had for the years before the financial crisis throughout the world, Norway maintained the well closed ticket.
"When we can swim in winter and make senderism in summer, we are pleased," says Anna.
"And eating rakfisk," adds with a swimming snake.
I'm in the snow doing colds to eat something; I had enough rakfisk.
Now a wheat hamburger is, uncertainly, something different and quite sweet to save.
But for the night, it returns that mallice fishing.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places in which a rakfisk scene is celebrated in which the comments vote the best fished, or maybe the one who makes the native fees most to test.
A television has been connected directly to a presentator that brings pajarite and is around with rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Concourse.
"What are your points for the best fishery there above in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our point, Havard."
There are rise and applauses.
A man falls from the shield, maybe winned by the water.
Or may be the vapores of all that fishing.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President from Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is prepared to pose his duty, the BBC corresponsal, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges to which the new President and the different expectations of its population will be addressed.
The traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, has already been congestioned, has been installed from Monday a steel circle that shorts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is caused by a huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers to reach their place of work, but to prevent protesters to reach the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and submit the country's management.
It is a complicated task.
Mexico has obtained good economic results during the outstanding government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is summarized in a war against drug drugs that has already been covered in six years.
"My Government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr. Peña Nieto at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Dispatch.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal."
Before codifying with the President of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr. Peña was a ruler of his birth state, Mexico.
A very poor state and a rapid growth, which rose the capital; opinions on the new leader are shared in this territory where he was moved.
A Honest Man
In the bukical city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with love.
His residents contribute to the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the agricultural roads and the full of baths renewed.
You can also see plates with your name in the entry of a modern polydeport and an interactive interactive museum on climate change.
"We believe that he can make a real and durable change," says his friend and aliad political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr. Peña Nieto's Partie, the PRI.
"Partially, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so needs."
After a 81-year-old period in the power, the PRI was deployed by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mrs Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the qualification that the opposition does not have the origin of the new President.
"He is a very honest, very compromised man and with a great vision of the country.
It's a fantastic state man and, above all, it's a person who knows listening."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their old ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the smooth streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
High autopsy is, in many senses, a suburb of the own city of Mexico.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug bands operating in barriers and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desertry park, situated near a swimming floor, the bodys of tens of women killed have been abandoned in such as in the past two years.
More than 1.000 women were killed in Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the ruler, a much higher rate than the city of Juárez, unfortunately famous for their violence and a place that is synonym of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, in the best cases, that I couldn't address the issue of feminine while I was in charge.
The most critical accused of their administration to do the gorgeous view.
In a hormig house, typical of the deteriorated barrio, Irina Buendía has to make efforts to contain the laugh while showing me photos of her fallen daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana was suicided in 2010.
Her family believes that her couple killed her.
"When I came to his house, it looked like they had cleaned the body," remembered Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been shot and the dead strike had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana's picture looks at from the walls, along with a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says that it has been rejected.
"State authorities have treated me as if it was a old chismose, an albourgator, a quessian.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that goes."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so many nervousness," says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibilities.
Decades of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years, and the new President has promised to give them priority during its mandate.
"I hope it was the same type of President that was when he was ruler," said the deputy of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza are worried more.
Bradley Manning did not condemn bad treatments, as they stated,
Inspectors are trying to face complaints of abuse of Bradley Maning during their stay in prison
The court focuses on the period of Manning in the Military prison of Quantico in Virginia
Defence wants to dismiss the case based on the serious incarceration of Manning
The army soldier is accused of robber thousands of confidential documents.
Scientists tried to demonstrate that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the most confidential filtering in the history of the United States, lost a number of opportunities to declare the bad treatments that now claimed he suffered while he was under military detention.
During the investigation that the investigation carried out to Maning in a view before the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the fiscal Commander Ashden Fein stated that the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia did not show any claim on the treatment received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view carried out on the request of the defence that the case was denied since his prison was hard and that it had already been sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had witnessed that he had thought to be killed while he was arrested.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of robber thousands of confidential documents while he was serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Maning out the source of information.
On Thursday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials fill after the visits to Manning during their arrest in Quantico's military prison, where he was arrested in maximum reclusion regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have made questions to Manning and reported their answers.
When the Friday Fein asked about the formularies, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment that the casters had given him as "excellent" and the treatment received in the installations in general as "more professional".
The formulars do not show any complaints of bad treatment, although officials requested Maning directly on the treatment that he received, stated Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officials who had visited him had spoken about these problems and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not let them observe those issues in the record.
"Scrib without incidents" (as far as I talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The Judge, Coronel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Maning why he had not claimed the treatment he had received during the meeting held in January 2011 with an advisor to consider the self-suicide intentions expressed in a month ago.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to achieve the reduction of the "prevention of illness" regime under which it was found.
The military said that they had put it under this restrictive regime, which is a degree under the possibility of suicide to ensure their protection and security of other people.
"I wanted the largest state that I was well and (he wanted) to stop being under the prevention of illness... to enjoy what, from my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning tested on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was recorded for almost two months before being transferred to military prison located on the basis of the marine prisoners in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said he had considered himself to be killed in Kuwait and, at one time, lost knowledge because of heat.
He said that the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what happened to him or what happened in the outside world was very anxious.
"My world was so excited only to the Arafjon Camping to that jaula," explained Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I would die in that jackle."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, most of the days were in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that only it was allowed to have a ball, a mantel, a channel, something of clothes and his skins.
I explained that I tried to move all the time, because I was banned to sleep or even tomb during the day.
Manning stated that he had always a light out of the outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said if the casters couldn't see her face when they turned around the night, they turned him out to turn back.
The lawyer of Manning submitted a formal complaint on the treatment received by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Wednesday, the judge asked Maning about a delegate who had done in the Jubilee declaration, according to which, after being obliged a night to sleep in Quantico's cell, he was obliged to remain slow in front of the prisoners and other prisoners.
Manning had witnessed that it was never given to him the opportunity to cover the mant during the account.
During the jury's interrogatory, Manning said that he decreed for the order he gave him the caster that had to leave the mant with which he could have been covered, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered to leave her to fall.
Manning witnessed the juvenile they had forced him to sleep in the past night because of an attempt to demonstrate an officer that he did not have a danger for himself.
Manning stated that he had told the office that he could have used the elastic of his internal clothes or his channels to self-release but that he did not.
Manning witnessed that that night they had removed his internal clothes, channels and skins.
His lawyers hope that the judge takes into account at least the experiences of which he had been experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence in case he was sentenced in the war council, which is expected to begin at the begins of the year coming.
The Defense stated that he was planned to make Manning a declare of minor crimes and defend other extreme accused of being considered too extreme.
The view is expected to be renewed this weekend and the fiscals are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon supported that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application to any detention which is found in Quantico low maximum custody.
The cases against Manning include cooperation with enemy, illegally cause the publication of information on the Internet, the filtering of the information of national defence and the robust of ownership or public registers.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be faced with perpetual chain.
My Crisis of Mexican-studio-United Identity
Reaffirms that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans intend to criticize those who have gone; he says remembering the Mexicoans of those difficult times.
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Staundians are cut into between two worlds.
In a recent journey to Mexico City, he was only cut by the explanated and reached to the Migration Traffic Zone and was already completely confused.
Some cards indicated the way to two wings: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Extrangueres".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, my whole life called me "Mexican."
This is the ethnical taquigraphy, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irlands" or my New York friends are qualified to themselves "italy".
Afterward, I decided for "the Mexican-Stodounidense".
But this was Mexico.
And, in the patriarch of my grandfather, the taquigraphy or the guides were not necessary.
He was just a US.
I speak Spanish. It's enough to manage me during a interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of a nation's vocabulary and I can't get away from my American acent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put me in the foreign colo.
I thought at that moment of this week in which the elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
In the agenda, as the leaders of these two countries were gathered, it was said: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was wanting to speak also of the growth of Mexico economy, one of the reasons for which in these moments it is so likely that a mexican is staying in Mexico as a result of going to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a commercial block on the style of the European Union in North America.
Furthermore, Peña Nieto promised that he continued to fight drug cards in Mexico, although he did not detail them.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of backup.
The majority of the United States probably never remembered that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cease half of their territory at a weapons point.
But for the mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that they remember are all parts.
So, at the time of a United States official says anything that brings the minimum critical to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican eleite, about how Americans are using the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctesuma are cut into war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million mexicans who live in the United States.
Did we talk about back?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not so.
The only reason why there are so many mexican ascensions living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogic tree, there was a person, may be the father or mother of the grandmothers who closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the times that the person was engaged in a certain profile: dark skin, a level of low studies from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Mexico no.
And, although we may live now in the American dream when we went to good schools and have had good works, we can't never lose any view that what we're living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It may sometimes be that our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is that it is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are conscious that many of the mexicans belonging to the eleite of the leader class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
We see as a memorandum of a humiliated derogation and look at us above the shadow as if we were from a lower category that is not enough to mexican.
Our Spanish will never be so good enough, and our lazos with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
In your way to see, our existence is synonym of failure.
If our family hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find us shocked after this seat corner, living well in the United States, but, still, like solitary souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, remembers that there is this rock between mexicans and the Mexicans and the Mexicans because the firsts know more solidity who are, and to the seconds, this is mourning.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
While so, many mexicans and Americans that I know feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We like to hear the Mexican group The North Tigres, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not raised to any of them.
In Mexico, you see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered mexicans.
Now, to complicate more things, so I have entered during my trip, some mexican leaders and some intellectors want to connect again with the diapothesis.
They want to work as "improved embassy" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our American partners that it is great to visit this country and to press the political leaders to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That won't happen.
There's too much back.
And, with the inequality of wages, gallery corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
It's right.
If some mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a half-year-old century ago, they must accept the fact that some mexicans and Americans are still rewarded for how they treated their families very less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more mexicans than I thought.
Visual battles, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could be an unprecedented basis for peace
Can any day have a sustainable peace between Arab and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood dilution that seems to indicate that any hope is in vanity.
In the midst of the inutilities and habitual discussions about whom first began, mounts of buildings have been reduced to shoes; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelites have been killed and, firstly, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to be anxious in their old conflict, as it turns out in the Middle East.
The Arab spring has left it all the pieces of things, or not, the Palestinians and Israelites have been touched in the regional alborote.
Maybe this makes your fight more blood than ever.
There are, however, reasons for thinking that their latter situation may be discalled.
A War that doesn't lose nor wins
At first, optimism is now very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire is maintained on 21 November, the faces of this week have been strengthened by both bathrooms.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelites to get away, although Gaza has received a good ball.
And despite having killed some of his leaders and put pressure to the 1,7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable and popular costs of the planet, Israel could not end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamás is winning land in West Jordan, the other part of Palestinian currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamás could reach the conclusion that the time plays for their favour.
Since Islamics have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamás has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renaissanced regional power that had previously been the most closest muslim aliado with Israel, has dealt with the cause of Hamas. It has also done Qatar, one of the most rich and dynamic states of the Golf.
The exciting members of Hamás say that the average Islamic moon is rounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hizbula party dominates Hizbula, passing by Syria, where the rebellies of a more Islamic tendency could slaughter Bashar Assad, until reaching Jordan, where the allies of Hamás are threatening the king.
In particular, in the southern flag of Israel, the growth of the Islamic sisters directed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most popular and fundamental difference of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lake depot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, has not been too long for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Sisters are the first brothers of Hamás and their leaders depend on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamás may be a protagonist who cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
At the same time, the duration of Israel will take the contrary conclusion.
As regards the military issue, they put Hamas on their site.
The anti-military system of Israel's Heritage Cups has demonstrated its efficiency and many of the Hamás mixes have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more quietly... for some time.
As regards diplomacy, the United States are more stronger than ever; many European countries have also blameed Hamás to have started the last oil of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the Government of Benjamín Netanyahu, a first minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the shooting cohetes from Gaza have ended with the life of some 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has not had too many self-suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the West Jordanian barrier, the main part of a aspiring territory to become Palestinian state, and protect the Jewish populations that continue to grow up, even though, according to international law, are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined a group of more harder lines leading to Avigdor Lieberman in the preceding period of elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Why do those Palestinian retreated look by giving them a own state?
If they really rule in West Jordan, would they not shoot cohetes as well as their companions in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shooting if they get the head up.
It may be imposed by the hard threshold, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamics taking power in Egypt and in other places do not have too much appreciation to Israel, their priority will address the internal difficulties.
The Israeli defence budget is greater than its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will help the new Arab governments to improve their economy.
The pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good shooting and could mark the start of something.
The Israelites should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world, more democratic, free the Palestinians from their right to self-determination is to create a polvere that one day will exploit in Israel's occupied territories as the same way this week has exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already mined by democracy in the Jewish state and democracy emphasizes the situation as it increases the Arab population.
Cross missions against Gaza each two or three years to reject Hamás will pay a more diplomatic peak.
Both baths need an employee of people in the conflict.
The solution remains that people are sensitive of both baths, most of the outside world and this magazine: two states and the sending of the territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, a little short-term time, is that the high fire gives a little more impulse to the people who are fighting for this reason.
Egypt, which must begin to put the weapons in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamás that he accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs instead of the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join themselves.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
During his first mandate, he refused to submit his own plan for peace.
Once again in the White House, it seems equal to resident to dedicate his attention.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest in the United States.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinian.
The generic smoke packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with illnesses light on boxes of a green color, which are the same for all smoke marks
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pionera in the world, enters into force and replaces the logs and the colors of the marks by a green oil, a splendid image of body parts with diseases and representations of children and children sick for being smoking parents.
Unlike the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, binding from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of source.
This is the most strict regime of the world applied to smoke package.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the goal is to dissuade young people of smoking by eliminating the race that this habit has glass.
I trust in studies that show that if a person has not started to smoke before 26 years of age, there is 99% of possibilities that never do it.
"You can see that children, even since very early age, understand the message that the smoke company is trying to sell through their brand", stated the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how the girls were related to the logo of a coron with the idea of being a prince.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoker rates in the world and that these changes will not be too affected by the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considered to take similar measures.
Tabak industry has exercised a huge pressure against law.
Tobacco enterprises said that the law would promote the black market, where cigarettes would be more cheap and more accessible.
"The legislation will cause serious involuntary consequences", said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of smoking that will bring China and Indonesia false manufacturers to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has been benefited from the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand of cylicon carpets and cups to capture the unpleasant pictures of the castles had been shocked almost from 800 months ago, when British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a law revocation in the Supreme Court of Australia.
She stated that Zico had sold up to 6.000 units to major institutions and that he was expecting more stocks.
For us, it's a good business.
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the democratic sector to which the plan is conducted.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising in television and sports partnership and who impose the majority of sellers to not put cigarettes in view, the marketing of smoke has been online.
Australia has prohibited advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be limited to foreign pages.
"If you market smoke and just remain this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincent place in which it is", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increased exhibition on brands from "food citizens" published on social network pages such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked if it is just a private citizen who really love the Marlboro cigarettes and has been taken the mole to make a video or if any marketing company is behind all that.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on the new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even paid to the Ukrainian, Honduras and the Dominican Republic rejecting the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that is injustly restricting trade, although no one of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to say a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had maintained conversations with other countries that are considered to apply similar laws in the field of smoking.
In 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently binding in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, it is considered to apply more harder laws.
In Australia, many smokers show disappointment.
" Photographs do not affect me.
I simply don't make them case."
"Try the cigarette and keep the package," Victor El Hage says while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Really, there's only one reason why I would stop smoking, for my daughter."
James Yu, chain manager King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes make it the most complex to put them in the stars.
"That was normally late an hour in developing a delivery; now four times ago," says Yu.
"The government should have fully banned to smoke, and then it's already closed, and we closed the shop," says while the hands upward.
In a constantly connected world, it is not so bad to burn a bit
During the Thanksgiving Day of this year, unexpectedly, I had to pass five hours in an airport because the aircraft in which we fly had suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had a lot of time to think about the aburriment.
I won't lie you.
It takes a half day in a airport waiting for a flight is quite slow, even if you have ways to be entered, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgoing us from the duty-free shops.
But there are more academic and child development experts that eggle the goodness of the burden.
According to them, it's good that, both us and our children, we smell once.
Burrishing the brain binds to search interesting options and may support creativity.
Since the majority of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of the burden.
So, should we accept a good spirit of burdening?
Yeah.
And no.
But, we'll already talk about that.
First, as many people, it suggested that, now that we have more time for the skin, the burden would be relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey says, Greek and Roman Catholic History of the University of Calgary in Canada, and writer of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" (The absorption, an animated history) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, isn't that.
"In fact, the history of the burden is very extensive," says.
In the walls of Pompeya there are graffiti in Latin on the burning dated from the first century d.C.
We should also draw up how we define the burden.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After considering the investigations published and putting the idea before a group of discussions formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the burden as the experience of "desear, but not able to participate in a activities that you are filled."
Reaffirms that the difference between burning and smell is that the person does not something but wants to do it.
It indicates that with the pathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of burning claims, "it is the change of the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense of time passes slowly."
The burning can sound awkwardly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are buried have to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while depressed people consider that the problem has it.
Sometimes we believe we're burned, when what really happens is that we have problems to focus on us.
In his study "The Uninggaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September's publication on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues, were sent to a previous experience in which participants listened to a skin of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room with a television program to all volumes that did not keep any relationship, others listened to it with the lower volume, so it was only perceived, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the program with the volume under showed more aburrition than the other two groups; the cost of focusing on them, but were not sure why and assigned to the burden.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the change of attention can lead to the burden," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neurocience of the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something awkward, how to detect defectuous pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not burn you."
"In fact, we are now aware that moves or make galvats, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of burden, can actually help him fight, because they do that person is physically more warning."
"The investigations show that children who are allowed to move to learn more and have more information than those who are obliged to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be burned at some moment: the delay of a flight, a monoton speaker, a specially frozen film.
But some people have more tendency to smile than others.
In order to help meditate it, some investigators developed in the 80s a "scale of burning trends".
The scale includes questions such as "mous things I have to do are repeating and monotones" and "I have so many things that I don't have time to do anything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, states that using these scales, researchers have discovered that children have more tendencies to be burned more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a group type that is quite easy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, carried out a experience in which 400 adolescents were contacted with their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of the adolescents said he would be buried while he was in school or do the duties, while 23 percent said he would be buried when he was not in the school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of the parents said they would be burned.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the current burden percentages, 21 years later, were higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that " adolescence is a period in which the burden reaches its higher counts", mostly because both children and adolescents do not give them a great control on what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of principle, is it good to be burned?
Sometimes it is not, because, leading to the extreme, it can make us exposure to absurd physical risks, how to put up or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to fight it, as well as showing research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between the burden and the creativeness, as Professor Vodanovich states, which has been studying this issue over two decades.
"The burning is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing another thing," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate.
If you're broken and using that energy to touch the guitare or kitchen, it'll be satisfied.
But if you see the television, it's possible to satisfy you in a short term, but not a long time.
"So, if your son is buried and gives him a iPad, it's possible that he's not cut off, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or to double himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "This ability to double applies to other situations", states.
Your son learns not only to entertain himself alone, but to learn to be better controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the burden.
But we should not be too critical with him.
Our goal should be, however, to feel comfortable paragraphs of the constant rum of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way to see, we need to burn us more, but the burning is a too worried and worried desire as to relate to it with something that deserves the punishment," says.
It indicates that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimized," says, " it's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the smile falls."
Coloured: No book of instructions for the new marihuana consumption law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student in a Community institution and fumbolist in the south-east of Colorado, is faced with a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state: the possession of some marihuana stones and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says that a September, he and some friends drived by Lamar, near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marihuana in the car, and a time later, Orozco received a judicial quote for the possession of drugs and related articles (minor crimes that each one confered $100) in which he was informed of the date of judgment.
"We treat as criminals," Orozco says.
And they're?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marihuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of causes of drug tension depends on the law less than the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes per possession of marihuana are canceled both here and in the Washington state, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped submit cargos against the older than 21 years by smaller possession, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the next weeks.
But the taxes of the most conservator districts in Colorado have been forced to continue with the cases open for marijuana's possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver’s suburbs to the Western mountains, are voted to prevent marijuana’s shops, recently authorized in their communities.
"It's all changed so fast that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just to the east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the rules in the State of Washington are also turning on the matter.
They continue to search for advisory to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all of this before the limit date is reached on 1 December 2013.
They say, for good or for bad, Colorado is in front of most states in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, portal of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what it could work.
"There is no real past which serves us as a model," says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be slow, since the license system in that state will still not exist, but the possession will be legal.
Furthermore, there are delicate mechanical issues that should be solved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to provide an "acceptable access" to the authorized marijuana and their prohibition of conducting cannabis business in a radio less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children's game areas or children's centres.
"In any place there will be more difficulty to have an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, the port of the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recent research group created.
On November 21, Oates, the police chief of Aurora, sent an email to his police officers in which he informed them that the city's police police would stop interfering judicial action for lack of marihuana’s possession to more than 21 years of age and that the police would stop reporting responsibilities against these crimes "in immediate effect".
The police head of Oates said that they would be able to comply with the rules of the city which regulates the cultivation of marihuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to continue to pursue traffickers and drug sellers.
In the gate of Ward, in the north of Colorado, the district's fiscal, Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to follow the cases of marihuana’s possession, mainly to press consumers and to be decided to be treated.
Today, 119 people are faced with posts of 56 grams or less marihuana, although many of them have other responsibilities.
" Our office has the obligation to interfere judicial actions against those lacks that had been offended at the time when they had occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rule of the Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marihuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the largest city of the gate, no longer refers to adults for small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the fiscal of the district, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pertaining to possession.
"I don't think it's losing time when he continues to comply with the law until it changes", he stated.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marihuana for recreative use of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that occur over the whole state show a marked ambivality between officials with regard to the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with the district taxes," said Sean McAlister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the accused of marihuana's possession and is local porter of the National Organization for the reform of marihuana law.
"There have been so long, bringing people to the courts that, in fact, they cannot still accept that it is legal," he stated.
As the first states that consider the small amounts of marihuana in the same way as if it is alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at national level in the law of drugs.
While lawyers and officials of the State have a new border of legal sales, they also expect an anonymous receipt of the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and crop of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of marihuana's legalization have hope that the Department of Justice is over.
Despite some highlighted arrests of patients and marihuana solders for therapeutic purposes, the Federal Government has allowed mostly to sell marihuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"As it is likely that anti-drought agents do not take the doors down to shut up a small drug bag, they will probably be reacted to allow the operating of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marihuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an advisor of drug policy of Obama administration.
several Colorado cities are not expected to act with the federal authorities.
Even before the elections day, some local governments adopted a morarious on any new business of marihuana, although it would pass around one year before any of them could open.
Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and it is likely that it approve the week that comes.
"We don't want to put us into a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level", explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the homening.
" Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted to vote for what the state has voted."
There are many questions in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I'm tired until I got Oxford for being a Tory."
It is not attacked by universities for their views only now
I don't remember any moment in my life in which I haven't dreamed to get a place at the University of Oxford.
My father and my grand brother had been in which I suggested was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: the free thinking and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks to take my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 80s to spend the historic cart, he had already done the shoes, which deleted the first scene of my life.
My father smiled and cryed.
My friends were unconcerned.
The Evening Standard stated that I had left because I did not tolerate that some university partners keep sexual relations in the room on the side.
The writer A.N. Wilson announced that he had gone because they were forced to drink me in unconciliated tastes.
The truth was less fun.
I'm out of there.
Yes, I'm gone, because I had been subjected to a sweet and intimidating system.
Not because of my extraordinary name, nor the fact that I came from a private school.
They pleaded me for one reason, that in the sight of the summoned illustration there was something intolerant and barbaro: my father, the difunto Woodrow Wyatt, was a high adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservator party.
Maybe they're wondering what this comes now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of the right centre students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutional and growing hate towards the conservator party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights that have homosexuals, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the JCR (grouping students of the Christi College) claim that they are "severely, personally attacked and treated as non-grate" for their political ideas.
They want to establish a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee in their university college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Right" (The Paradise: youth, brilliant and right) on the policy of students and presented the Tories as extreme and neonazis.
He showed the puzzle student Joe Cookie, an ex-president of the Oxford University Conserver Association, in a Rolls-Royce Royce, playing a plated clothes and a bathroom with the plate empugnature.
In other universities, conservator students say that they are treated as "Turk Heads" for the introduction of higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Nottingham University Conserving Party Association, declared in a Sunday Journal that " there is a growing left trend in universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club without or even know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and historical student in Corpus Christi, who presented the movement for a greater protection, states that this environment is "incommoted," while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, claims that the attitude of JCR members towards those who are in the right center has started.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate and for the welfare of members," said.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, was a 18-year-old young man.
The hatred towards the Conserver Party was at its highest point.
In the past year, the university had voted to reject Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honoris cause" after the financing of the Supreme Education.
The environment had been extremely surprised by any stalinist.
For the first days of the week of Welcome to the new universities, when new students are known and acquainted with the Catholics, I received a sample of the amarcure that I was expected.
I found that the Catholics did not only the gorgeous view of the mofa that was made from the conservator universities but also participated in it with good profit.
The policy of mining, privacy and opposition of the Government to the sanctions against apartment in South Africa reached to the seminar wood rooms.
Firstly, I should be helped to translate French texts of the XVIII century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Sra. Wyatt," said the Catholic Harry Pitt, " please translate the first paragraph."
I don't say any.
Pitt, a swimming man with a face that looked like a wig-max, knew well how to escape bad bilis.
"Is that the checherists refuse to learn French or is that they are just tons?" asked.
Other universists were rid.
The eyes of the laugh that I tried to contain.
"I suggest you to go to French classs in your free time, always and when you're not too busy to know people," Grudged Pitt.
I reserved my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at the dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight palmed on the shoe.
He was a second-year English student named James, who was presented as OUCA member.
"I know who you are," said me kindly.
"I'm afraid it's how it's okay.
They're putting up with anyone who's suspected to be Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so that's gonna be worse for you.
Many recently experienced Tories appeared to be workers."
Further, in a local pub, I tried cobardly dismissing.
I asked that I didn't agree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That truck resulted inutile.
One student of the first year of Philosophia, Politicals and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You're a fascist sweet daughter.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned me into the pervertida Sweden.
"Why do you have sexual relations?", asked one.
"It's going to give one to another one, don't it?"
I felt the same way that homosexuality should be sensible before the Liberal Law of the 1960s.
Can I take a normal life in Oxford some day?
Would I be obliged to stay with people who thought like me only after the night?
Should I make laboratory and repress my natural trends?
The three years I was expected were presented as a purchase of ostracism and isolation.
The only Catholic Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him because they were not only the Conservator party, but also the counsel of Thatcher in external policy and one of the people who wrote his talks.
I was just there.
He detested the place that he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his accession to the Marxist-determinist vision of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a castle at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," said me.
I started to move daily from Oxford to the house of my parents in London, finding refusal in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all the political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place of the world," said with tristeness.
"They never did that, not there between my loved teacher shoes.
Even my communist friends always had an implicit attitude."
His painful eyes started clouding.
"Don't give me another chance.
I'm sure they did it only to broke.
I would leave my heart if you leave it."
Happy of many travels to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
One of my friends, who also supported the Conservant Party, had succeeded in pressure and had rejected his faith.
The next week, during a seminar in which another Catholic history had instructed, speaking completely seriously, that I was a "anxiety of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted that my parents had me "lated the brain" and called them "the old fools."
It's been a little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career at Oxford.
By that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was closed with key.
I was in fear, and in the past five minutes my persecutors disappeared.
When the shooting was done, I took the first train in London.
I never returned.
Maybe you call me weak lloona.
But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is still more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 first ministers of the Conservator Party, but that today, after a reputation, no valuation of equality and freedom of thinking is hidden.
"Valentino prefers the allegation to notoriety."
For the sample "Valentino: Master de la Costura", who has been inaugured this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to accommodate an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective pharmaceutical that meets more than 130 high-coated clothes created by his "maison" for the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," says with its unconfundable Italian acent.
This sample is the colony of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its different customers.
Valentino always has a sense of fascinating the wedding and far away the world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exposure, open to the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the sign of the most granted aristocracy from Princesa Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by the Princesa Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England.
Valentino teaches these personal memorys as trofees of their social ascensus: of modest modest in the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the "item-set" internationally.
Be lovers of reality has nothing bad.
"It's at least they're not cutting the legs of their boyfriends on your magnificent shooting as they do some beautiful fantasies of pop music," says the baroneous Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, we lived both in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular anfitrion and interviews with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmuter of "Heini" Thyssen, intimately forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered the election to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the carism of the modest.
For many years, after a breakfast in Piazza di Spain, Rome, we went to his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In each detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, all looked and felt his spirit.
"Anyone of the guests made us feel important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Cost week, in 1995.
"No way pass, because your designs are works of art", remate.
Hot Desfile
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of well matched loves.
He loves people with good education and best titles, and they love him.
One of the galaxies of Sorset House has been transformed in a glass-level passue of six hundred meters long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must be disabled by the pasture to contemplate a "audience" of a master works of Valentino, such as the clothes that Jackie Kennedy chose for his marriage with Aristotels Onassis, the clothester who used Monica Vitti in "La Notte" or a lana and piel ball belonging to the Emperat Farah Diba.
In this public of maniquies are names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria van Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norwegia, Bulgarian Rosario or Habsburg Sofia.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "is impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalone, a shop, a "gilet" chaleco and a chat of the autonomy collection 1971-1972.
"I was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I prefer him above others for his feminine, for his great love to women, because it realises our beauty," adds the former duchese of Feria.
I like the colors that I use, have great light and are "donts" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princesa and model prescriptor Patricia della Jovpaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time you saw a Valentino.
When I was adolescent and lived in Italy, I was dreaming to have the age and time to use one of his night clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, the time was finally arrived.
I purchase my first clothes from Valentino to use on a party at the castle of my first, the Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red clothing, with flights, "corsage" dragged and chosen word of honor.
"I was a real dream", says Rodrigo's widow of Arenberg.
"Valentino is indiferent to mode, its obsession is the temporary", explains this Italian aristocratic who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg holds his modest feast clothes with "the maximum care... because a clothing is not only a clothes, it is also the assembly of memorys".
The "rey" of the mode
The great end of the Sunrset House exposure is Mary-Chantal Miller's girlfriend in her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.

The world's hardest office: the human beginnings of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcan porters play life and health by loading 70 kilos of stone seeds through stone seeds
There are people for which their work is a hell and another that, literally, works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mines who wins life through the abdomen of Kawah Ijen, on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, you must slow each day to the background of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that eats from the wings of the earth is solidated when you enter the air.
After launching large soft rocks, which are totally counting about 70 kilograms, it loads them in two bamboo stones loading on their shadows through stone seeds.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the vulcan, which is up to 2.386 metres, but the extensive ports late over 40 minutes in tortuga steps, guarding the balance and measureing their steps to not rescue and fall through the precipitation.
They know that any transpire could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was disappointed for years by the risks of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen win 5 cents of euro for each kilo of azure that extract
Once above, they open a step between tourists that were pictured as if they were circle monkeys and, fairly loading the canasta weight, spend three miles (3 km) to the balance that a mining company has located a little lower, up to 1.850 meters of height.
This is the PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits the volcano since 1960, and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupia (5 hundred euros) for each kilo of sweat.
Then it comes to the petrochemical industry by 10,000 rupias (83 cents of euro) because this mineral is generalized in the cotidian life and is used to manufacture cells, artificial fires, cosmetic, dynamics and even to bleeding sugar.
"When normally it is loading 70 kilos, we get some 46,000 rupias (3,8 euros) on each trip," we explain Anto, who usually take three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends, but allows it to join 138.000 rupia (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a mercy for such an inhuman effort, it is the trial of what would win in the field.
"The mineral newspaper is very high here, where the collection of coffee is payed to 15,000 rupia (1.2 euros) the day and average monthly payment is of two million ropees (167 euros), and the portator, who was previously worked as a ball in the Bali tourist island.
There, his lounge was 75,000 rupias (6.2 euros) day and the bath was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people near the volcano, because of a weight reason that in Indonesia resulted as condensed as the azure: "I caught with a young bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought it to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asma, breathe with difficulty, constantly touched, and the eye is irritated by toxic gases
At its 27-year-old, Anto takes three pieces in the Kawah Ijen, whose azufre has already started to pass the facture even to cover the face with a special mask.
It has asma, breathe with difficulty, constantly touched, and the eye is irritated by the toxic gases that disappears the volcan.
It's the price that you need to pay for your dream.
"I will work more than two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable English.
Casted by life, this good and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, room or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of doing the work of a start.
Sharing an immense wood chain with other portators, each day it is up to two of the lunch because the sweet does not stop dinner at night, when its charming color becomes blue and brilliant in the midst of the darkness.
Having disappointed the shadows, Anto cut down the clatter alummbling with a small lingery adhered to his castle, that he himself purchased with his money.
Some 400 portators load the blue shoes on their shadows from the background of the crater
Despite its pinguing benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sugar to spend costs or provide any equipment to transporters who work for their account and weight.
Indeed, there is no part of the $30,000 rupia (2.5 euros) of loading by camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupia (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park cover to tourists that add to photograph the volcan and their human beginning.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old portator who carries in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since he left the college.
The ability to get up up to 110 kilos, ensures that you will survive by working "all that can" because you need money to educe their three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not gonna jump, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
While the sweet smells and hears the eye when the wind changes in improvisedness and touchs mines in the pillars that come from the volcano, they are so hard that no one is going to suffer serious diseases... more, more clearly, it is, of its usual breathing problems, artrosis, pains on the wheels and smells in the shadows, which have been misformed by the weight of the smells.
Oninik is already able to load 50 pounds to its 53 years by balanced the shooting.
Each day, he and his companions get 15 tons of azufre to the volcano, which three trucks transfer to the store of Tamansari, 18 km from distance through a path of castle between the wickedness.
"I'm not gonna smile, I'll die here because the volcan has been my whole life," Uninik announces by opening the mouth well, where it misses several dents.
From its five children, the larger, 30 years of age, also works loading azure.
The time passes, but the perpetual mercy of generation in generation is one of the hardest offices in the world: which makes the human beginning of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore search for babys to save the economy
Singaporees are responsible for car, stress and cost of property and education because they do not have children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we have our civil duty and we believe life!
It may seem inverosimil that these verses are part of an advertising of menta tables, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "We'll put a bath (ball) on the horn" to ride from Singapur's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers the hope that with the logren advertising to call attention on the problem in a pleasant way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said I wanted to use the power of music so that people comply with "the national duty".
This is just something of the internet, so we had to do it fun and pleasant.
It is the greatest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in reproducing us itself, so we felt that this was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with feromons or organizing velets of rapid quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1,2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so much to the ligery.
$1.300 per year in policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 for child, extends maternity licenses and depends on fiscal benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high technology city in South Asia, also known by the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population division, is currently at 1,2 children per women.
The last time I was above 2 - known as a reposition rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singapore has no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "more education" and "a larger range of carriage opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, more than to marry and form a family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in solitary and to the delay of marriage and birth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
At the same time, an immigration policy pointed to dramatically increase immigration to face it with the decline of the population has created residues between local populations.
In Singapore there are websites where the xenofobia is only disrupted against many new immigrants, especially the Chineses, who criticize to maintain low wages and not integrate.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the Singapore Government party has experienced its worst electoral result from independence last year.
Since the elections have been trying to correct the problem, with higher quotas and gravities for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While birth rates have an impact on the economic growth of a nation, fiscal income, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban Development Authority has been controlling the number of small apartments known as "shaped box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square metres and have had a lot of success of sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single life style and decline the developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shaped boxes" are much faster than the largest units.
They are most popular in the sense that the units are dry days, even weeks, faster than the larger size units.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide more clear guidelines for developers, to which they were previously working if they wanted to provide delays in a project.
Strengtheless
Singapore is a state city.
Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase in national birth rate, speaking with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the same centre that will not have much effect.
"The people are very stressed, houses are faces and it is also education, so many people are put it", says a young executive man.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to tell me my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Man and women mention their care, stress and cost of property and education, such as reasons for preventing children.
So, for many years, the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children when it is about to make children, the Singaporees are who have the last word.
Lo private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Real Academy Dictionary, it is the private quality or "the area of private life that is right to protect from any intromission".
What is private for a less than 16 years?
How does this definition apply in your cotidian life and social networks?
Does the dangers that are exposed to ventilation in Internet situations that would probably not share out of line?
The period interviewed five boys from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four of these cases, they associated the term "something very mine", at the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not go to a post", says Jorge, ten years old, when trying to explain the meaning of private in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where you have accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone," says.
In FB under beautiful images or games.
I'm also talking to my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't my, or from someone who's doing the smile," says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos of dishonored persons, crimes or to write humilious or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends who have in FB and its nine followers on Twitter.
Most are parents.
The mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express me and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just under them," adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can speak with far-related relatives or with my friends rapidly," says.
I do not doubt that I would never accept a request of an unknown person.
I wouldn't make him a case to someone who recommends for a stranger.
Joseph's case of 14 years is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest applies not to know 20 of the agreed persons in his friends list.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," says.
According to the boy, no one has entered it or requested the address of your home or phone number.
"If they pressure me or just demand me the shoes of my account," you know.
José was a follower of Ask, after reading a Twitter recommendation.
The boy is not the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
One known friend of my friend was extorting him in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"No one knows who he was," says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"I just put him in privacy."
And it explains a series of steps to set the account safely.
On the contrary to Jorge, this boy would go up photos of known in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yes, I would do it if I'm bad or I'll get it.
"I know that's cyberbullying," says.
Key Questions
Mariles Porras, English teacher and licensed teacher in Education and Education, considers that to guide children and adolescents to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Internet occurred as a means to find information, but with the appearance of these sites, they changed the rules of the game," said.
Porras pointed out that the Academic Marc Prensky, awarded in Pedagogy by the Yale University and author of the Digital National and Migrant Work, launched these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital nationals are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we need to teach them when we are still learning," says.
He comments that the theme is complex, "for we ask you to have a defined criteria on what it should or not spread, publish or say to a age that does not give it for that."
"If they are also selective when what they are most important is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is private for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"True that you don't serve it," adds.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell him to a strange, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to publish a picture of you as you published from a friend?
You know what the other publishers about you?
When you label photos of the party, did you ask the other people to label them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make you see you have to act on line as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Are outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be in social networks," says.
Monitoring
Studio Guardia, university Catholic, professor of primary and educational consultor, comments that it is essential that family parents read with consciousness social network policies.
By understanding each of the incises, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish, says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remember the children's lesson of "not speaking with strangers".
End of the Unsur Summit without making public the Declaration of Lima
The VI Presidential Summit of the United Nations (Unasur) has concluded today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration was publicly announced previously and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandates.
Effee tried to reiterate access to the document signed in the VI Order Meeting of State and Government of Unsur, but sources of Cancillery and Presidency indicated that it would be given after the closure, but then they stated that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian Government's website.
In consultation with the text, they pointed out that the content was exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a short declaration to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was at all times limited.
During the newspaper only was transmitted, in the press room, the video without sound from the Presidential Assembly with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information circled among the reporters was provided by the press votings of some of the Unsur Governments assistant to the quote, although not Peruvian.
The only document published during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which occurred in the shortage of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media requesting more information.
Afterwards, the Peru Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the Summit, but it is the vote of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the anfitrion of the IIIth Summit America of Southern Arab America (ASPA), and at that time, although it was urgently requested by the press, the also called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced was not extended.
On the official ASPA website, the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international quotes, the Peruvian authorities strive to have safe transmission systems for all journalists but limited to the receipt of information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure from the Hague Court that represents a different border between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were meeting during the regional quote and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the (Cí), which begins the Monday in the Haya to listen to the delegates of both parties, in the process that Lima had submitted against Santiago.
"We will draw up and execute the judgment that defines the differences we are today leading to this international court," Humala said, along with his chilean par.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a respectable country of international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts," acknowledged Piñera, and he welcomed with an appreciation of hands to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two Presidents that they would be subjected to the CIM was then that Colombia declared this week the Bogotá Covenant accepted to be subject to the failures of the International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which considered seriously wrong.
The Summit was held with the insights of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Onesur since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the quote.
Anfitrion, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the Summit, short after the Middle East.
The mandate reads the final document in which 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between South America ' s countries were fixed for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted that UNASUR countries would give "important steps towards the purpose of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements".
It was reported that "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, action to make medications more accessible, access to internet to low prices in all demands of South America, and to attain joint and efficient risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Late America) must not have a triunfalist matrix, but must serve to expand our productive matrix and visa a better future for our peoples," acknowledges Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas, together with our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, five were corresponding to Peru, and are located in the cross-border edges of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two pointed to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not have more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in that country will serve for its reintegration to the United Nations of South America," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relationships between neighbors, was another of the issues underlined by the Summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he started his participation in the regional quote that he expected to meet with his couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference after a CCI failure, questioned by Bogota.
"The morning day (Sat) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said Santos.
"We'll review all these ways, are not exclusive, including the Nicaragua Treaty, will require a conversation with Nicaragua," said.
" With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they are planned to attend the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, as part of the Summit, the ministers of the Bloc Defence had previously been meeting to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the Presidency for the time of the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerika, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential Summit of the United Nations of South America (Unasur), was held in Lima, declared the Peru TV state that Europeans were "slaughtered in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are almost a patriarch".
In that sense, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship that supported the Member States of Unsur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South America has to be obtained, as is already happening to the integrators of the Andina Community, but there are still reactional sectors that want us to return to the past," warned.
Furthermore, the Ecuatorian President was shown in favour of the recovery of the United States Organization (EEA) under the premium of raising the influence of the Anglosay states and taking into account those signed by the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who give cathedra never compromise to nothing, and instead, we are the South Americans signed it all.
"It's incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under the financing of the United States", stated Ecuador in the allegation of the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa has assured that it is not repentant from that decision because it did not trace his principles, but respected its "democratic and human rights deep values".
He stated that, at its time, "would the suspects found that Assange was extracted to a third country and that it was not respected by its process."
He also criticized the Swedish justice in order to require him to be subjected to the questionnaire in his territory by a sexual offence when "the Swedish law allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken with him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuatorian mandate.
Whatever is the danger that your physical and mental health is deteriorate because it is closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"It's complicated the health of any person," added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum offered to Assange since June at the Ecuatorian Embassy in London, through the conception of a savior conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities, and stressed that there had been discussions with London in searching for a solution to the end of the WikiLeaks founder.
We did not negotiate human rights, we did not use it in this case, but have been continuing conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European instances", said.
And he thought, "If Great Britain last morning the safe drive this ends."
And if Sweden, as perfectly allows its legislation and as he has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or asks it to Skype tomorrow ends this problem.
Correa used to reaffirm themselves as a defender of the freedom of print and died that what does not tolerate is "middleness, bad faith and lie, which disfellowship the freedom of expression".
"The older enemy of the freedom of Press are not the evil and wicked politicians, but the bad journalists on the basis of the struggle, chasing and extortion," said.
In this regard, it was pleased that these journalists weren't "no more bankers or hegenic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and said that they would be released "developed in the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay veto in Unsur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body should "that should be strong and not tolerate the opportunism and the revested golpism of legality" because in reality "destruit the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian Homologo, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the failure of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which benefited from the Nicaraguês sea sovereignty.
At the time, that failure is not completed.
It is a problem between a South America and a Central American country.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will of walking together.
We need to process them in a wide way to overcome them and continue.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the struggle by maritime limits that remain in the same Peru and Chile court and believed that "that is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries were engagement to accept a short failure."
With regard to the possibility presented as a candidate in the next presidency elections in Ecuador to find a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that the possibility "with very optimistic and joy, although sometimes is very hard."
Correa ensured that if you lose the beginning of February 2013, it will be removed from public life.
I have never interested the power in personality, but in situations such as Ecuador this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was who guaranteed this likely victory, because we have to accept that reposibility," said.
It would be my last period in the presidency and we go out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he stated.
Correa was also referring to the new health treatment of the Vienna President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and said that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned by rutine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It does not mean a recurrence in the health state of President Chávez,” said.
Today, the head of Ecuador State participated in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations of the South American Union (Unasur), which concluded with a greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Manufacture was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: positive AIDS.
"I was like if I broke a bomb," refers to remember the time of the announcement, that the doctor tried to make "more smooth", without clear success.
The boy hid it to his family.
He decided to be charged only of her sickness and began to report about it; with such efforts that she had already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is, uncertainly, one of the oldest patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital Unit of the Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Manufacture lives with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more strictness.
Then, until the director of an IMSS clinic, he avoided his "for he brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now you can survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorants of their illness, many still arrive when virus has already caused rabbits, "acted" their immunological system and are victims of opportunist infections.
At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least in the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who begins to treat and survive the general population is exactly equal," stated the head of the HCG Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was entered in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infection and experts in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva stated that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and life quality depended on the impact level of immunological systems that present patients at the starting of the diagnostic, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: from 30 years to 50 years of age, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that who receives the positive HIV diagnostic at the age of 25 years of age, under these terms, "which keeps in control can live without problems until 75 years of age," explained the interview.
To dimensionate this progress, it is remembered that the hope of life of the Mexicoans today is of 76 years in average.
While mortality has significantly slowed in the past few years, in Mexico, the number of patients who died from AIDS slowed from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNSIDA Annual Report), also is true that 60 percent of patients have failed from the appearance of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Jalisco had fallen in 2011, and from 187 deaths until May of this year; however, there is a universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
So I see it, so happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have no drug disappointment, the problem is that patients have been very advanced because they don't know the state of infection, i.e. in late phases of disease.
God has given a contundent: "Now of every ten patients come when they are already presenting some opportunist infection what you have to have to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make diagnostics more premature and therefore must be offered massive detection tests to all those who need it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the AIDS State Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients like Fabrizio, who had seen the test to a special laboratory, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite the short age of him, was already in AIDS stage and even AIDS, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you're sick.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'm better returning three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, eat me well, exercise, take the medicines.
At the time, their parents only know that he was ill to cancer.
I lived a normal life, like anybody.
"Occupied, I have many activities, travel, I have a active sexual life, but corresponsible, I care for me and the other person," said Fabricio, who accepted to share his intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate his witness to those today, in the framework of the World Day of the AIDS.
What the tests are done, if they were risked, which, among them, know whether they are positive HIV, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.
That, his message, resumes the battle sheet to AIDS this 2012.
Conditions after the displayer
Great are the shoes between the health programmes and the common citizens, Sussevo Ricardo Salazar, a smooth journalist who has taken the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condons has been effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now gives us 100 packages, and that's very good but results that there are still people who have access to a condition," said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question, with a sound and judicial value of social workers, school orientators, pharmaceuticals and health personnel, which did not want to exposure adolescents, ensured the communicationr.
I propose to reorientate this distributed inefficiency; that the condons are not only after the demonstrators, and that hundreds are found in public baths dispatchers of the sites that use youths.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
It is no matter to pay them the chelas and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered, as he asked if there would have been a redistribution of conservatives in his administration.
"There is not sexuality, the best is approaching convictions to those already practiced a sexual activity," he pointed out.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4° national place in new and AIDS accumulated cases and 13th HIV.
92% of counties correspond to sexual path, 6% to blood and 2% to perinatal route.
It is estimated that 500,000 people may live with HIV because, for a registered case, there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Raised by a United States appeal court, a sentence that is unknown of the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro achieved group traveled to a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a previous slight for any national undertakings with rations in the neighbouring country that had problems of solving.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the signs that permit mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contrast to international conventions.
In the practical field, the slope of the sentence issued on June 15, last by Judge Harlin Hale from the Court of Bancarrotas to the northern Texas district, lets the mexican signs in defence against the possibility of embargo of its property in all the parts of the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main vessel manufacturer in Mexico to address the United States Supreme Court, arguing three inconsistences.
While the judge of the case states that creditors should be registered by the Act of Quiebras of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, with seat in New Orleans, said that the principal procedure is the commercial competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would imply on the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with transnational profile.
Indeed, to that end, the United Nations Model Act for the Uniformity of International Market Law was established, as an arbitrator of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition, the debts that had with its matrix of Vitro, had not been achieved by the majority required to adopt the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are a mid-docent examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-company debts took place by the Federal Institute of Markings.
It is also true that remaining the votes of the branches, in all ways the creditors of Vitro fighting against them in the United States Courts, namely the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The Court of Appeals derogates the date.
From another angle, it was Vitro's difficult situation from 2008 to the low of the serious economic crisis in the United States, taking the collections to the country.
In time, the signing of the family González Sada will interfere a revision request to the Court of Appeal to reach the full of the vote, i.e. the five judges, since they have only voted three.
This will not be achieved by the Requirement of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a superior instance, in this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the Court has subscribed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae, in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Market Concours Act was desacreed with appeal to the conventions signed by both countries to coordinate it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has been implemented by the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debts and creditors.
Two bands character: take you to Vitro and get it to the country.
General balance

Search for Dragon Mart

Hector Heinth Reyes: "The balloncet has been my life."
Trottants of the ball Hector "Hetin" Kings were more than 60 years old in the table sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Many people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local balloncet history as he has Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a cerebral slaughter was confined to a rude seat in 2008, the kings were insured in the sport for over 60 years, it was as a player of minor categories, a player of the National High Baloncet, supported and leader in the BSN with the Bayamon Vaqueros or President of the Baloncetto Federation.
"I put a lot of shadows in the baloncet through my life, including several times, as when I was President of the BSN, the head of the National Team and the federal President of the 1990s," recorded Kings during a visit from First Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The ballonest has been my life."
Kings don't exager to make that warning.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memorys that denote their broad trayectory, so proof it.
Charming in the heart
Of course, those who smell more emotion are those who remember their step by the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as player until 1982, when he complied 15 years as coapodered or supported by the French.
"These were my best years, those who most distressed me because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros campionates since 1967, they were already supported, co-faced or leader.
Those were many years of satisfaction, including the five chambers run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I was drunk with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN.
From then on, "Choo" Ortiz was charged, which was a great administrator", stated Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player of 6"7.
You want it?"
And that's the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players he had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the francotirator Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best drivers.
I remembered that if Mincy had given him a champion to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Vaqueros campionate with Gausse enjoyed it, but the distance was already away, because for 1988 it was already federal commanders.
For that time I prefer to enjoy its executives and the Mincy at the National Team.
I remember when we win to the United States for the first time during the 1989 Preolympico.
Then the World of 1990, where we arrived fourth places and should have been bronced to be not by the Canadian arbitre that made us repeat the final game for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that World Group of 1990 the best national team you have seen?
It is among the best, just as who won him to the Dream Team in the 2004 Olimpiade.
But my favorite was the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we told him one for the United States team, which was very similar to who wined the bronze in the world.
That team did not only repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had "Toñito" Colon and James Carter youth, Leon Brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which couldn't be in 90 because of a lesson on the rodille.
A team that may not be the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Preolympico in Newquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of players suspended by the Lake of the American Panorama of the Plata, we win gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Uncertainly, that's been Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that's without telling his trayectory in the different links you played.
Who was the best boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good shooting that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armageddon Torres.
Young people, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think your biggest achievement in the Federation?
It was a part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995, and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a time.
What's the rest of you to do?
There were things that would like to implement, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams of other island rewards in national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certificates and course for leaders, table officials and arbitres.
That's good to me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listening to music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my neighbors and sometimes when I go to balloncet games.
And of course, enjoying my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Morde the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931, was worldly famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R.", in the "Dallas" TV series in which he was incarcerated to a man of business without scrupulous, malicious and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the magnetic depredator J.R. Ewing into the "Dallas" television series, became a symbol of the aviation in the 1980s, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new time of "Dallas", died on Wednesday after the night because of cancer complications, according to a reporter of the family offered to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer home of "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his loved birth city of Dallas, representing again the iconical role that I liked most of him," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original and sequence series, was with Hagman when she falled in a hospital of Dallas, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
I was gonna bring him joy to all whom I knew.
It was creative, generous, pleasant, sweet, sweet and talental, and I will extraordinarily strange it.
"He was a original person and lived the maximum life," he said in a communication.
Hagman diagnosed the hepatic surrose in 1992 and acknowledged that he had taken a lot of years.
In 1995, he was found a malicious tumor in the heat and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman was famous in the television as a decent type in the lingery "I Dream of Jeannie" distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it she interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, a astronomy whose life is changed when she finds a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he lived with him in his home.
He was also a protagonist of two commodities that had been shortly at air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his magistrate interpretation of the charmly detectified J.R. that brought Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit were at the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "What shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectative expectations around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars raised in shipping houses.
He also helped to give the series a hearing record at that time.
When the response was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, a average of 41 million TVs synchronized it and converted to "Dallas" to the second most visible entertainment programme of history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectrums.
It was J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. was pregnant and then shocked her with a prostitute, unless he left out of the city, but others had reasons for attacking it.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an inconsistent corruption with a carististic sound: a tramped entrepreneur and an infidel husband who tried to make his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was inside.
"I know what I want in J.R's laugh," said Hagman in 1988.
I should say, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation that he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled the Friday to Hagman as someone "shooting me, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and unreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, we had the chance of knowing him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success to the TNT channel.
The record of five of the chapters for the second time and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was no immediate statement of Warner or TNT about how Hagman's loss series will be managed.
Oriundo of Fort Wordh, Texas, was a son of the actor and sing Mary Martin, who sing out classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when he was married in 1931 with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried luck in the New York theatre scenarios at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
When he was there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and caught with her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where they lived in many celebrations.
In 2001 he titled his memory "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I would think he's going to let someone or affect them anyway," said the Asociated Press at that time.
After hepatitis transplant, he became a promotor of the donation of organs and worked as volunteer in a hospital to attend fearful patients.
"The advice, I give them valuable, I meet with them when they come to their surgery, and then," said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer something of comfort, like "no friend, will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
It was also active against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starting course to explore the "Fin of the World"
Each week, students explore pharmaceutical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and generations, and global heat.
This semester, when the teacher in religion Stuart Charmen decided to set a course on the end of the world, I knew that he was counting with an irresistent angels: the end of the "width back account" of the Maya Calendary on 21 December, which many people had been obtained as a test that the end of the world comes.
But Charme had no idea of what he was expected in the next couple of months: Huracán Sandy, a fiscal precipitation that some have called "dedumageon" and a growing conflict that involved Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of the times believe that the Apocalypsis will start.
"I did not realize that this would be the most philosophical semestre that has happened", said Charme this week to students of the University of Rutger-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days and accounting, this has been a very good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher that offers courses on the "fine of the world" this semester, in the theory the last of the history.
In Temple, the adjunct professor Barry Vacker is dedicating the course "Medios, Cultures and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore pharmaceutical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and generations, and global heat.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with time," said, and the way they offer hypothic scenarios that lead some human behavior.
If nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, it could be a war.
In this month, students analyzed films with pharmaceutical topics and investigated how compared with examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what it's likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin America History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made a team to set a course, just titled "The end of the world".
"We don't add '2012' to always tell the option to resume the course again, if the world doesn't end", said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students should study, generate projects and take final reviews.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in viver of the Apocalipsis, which does not leave students another option than working " until the same night in which the world will end", said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"He disappointed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the seventh, of people who asked whether it was still happening.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I'm fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old school student in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that philosophy, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of the same.
Will Wekesa, a student of Psychology and Nursing carriage of 25 years, said to have seen all the apolyptical films.
"I had never heard about a class that could teach that," said.
I enjoyed it.
But no student interviewed - and much less than one professor - said to believe in the date of falling December 21.
"Our first project was treated about the maya prophecy and in a certain manner we dismissed it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years and West Chester.
The mais never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But there was an apocalyptical concern in the Western culture, which turns back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts, people don't think about this," he said.
In most of the world of English speaking.
Joseph Duugherty, a teacher of religion at the University of La Salle, who imposes courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about some course about the "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," wrote, teaching an exception of a superior authority.
We have a dad's indulgence.
Restall noted that during the years has been spoken of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosoph that 21 December is the start of a seven-year period during which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date slow.
Some say they think they're going to "the end of the world".
"I may call some friends to get together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
