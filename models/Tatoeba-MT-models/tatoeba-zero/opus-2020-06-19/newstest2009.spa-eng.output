The Prague Bolsa ended with less points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Bolsa corrected his losses.
The transactions of the actions of äzzz reached about half of the values they have on a normal day.
The Prague Bolsa, at the beginning of March, immediately reacted to the fall of the Monday when he decreased around 6%.
The downset of this time must be on the fall of the action in Wall Street.
This is also expressed in the market response to the result of the vote of the American Representative Assembly that was refused to support the plan for stabilising the secretariat of the financial sector.
Actions in Asia
The actions of the Asian Bols lived on Monday a dramatic fall, although the index finally was part of losses.
The Hong Kong Bolsa Hunt Seng index during its financial day marked almost a percentage of its losses, although later he reduced almost 2,5 per cent of its losses.
The China Enterprises Index that continued to move Chinese actions in the Hong Kong Bolsa decreased a 3,8 per cent, and the markets were closed in Shangai.
The actions of the Sidney Bolsa lost more than five percent, but finally losses were 4.3 per cent.
The Cuban Bolsa, according to the Index Secretariat, was 3.6 per cent.
"The savings actions scheduled in the United States are insecure, and this affects the financial market around the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Month Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, she only determines its monetary policy, namely, without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should be meeting as soon as possible, according to the first Australian minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal for support to the financial system.
Otherwise, threatening falls will be felt in other countries.
Blood bathroom of American actions
On Monday, the United States Representatives Assembly rejected the financial system of assistance to $7,7 billion (only $12 billion).
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the index of the actions was the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index was almost seven percent. A similar volume fall was recorded last time in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but soon it was shown that the proposal of the Assembly was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress is retired: the US Government can inject $7,7 billion in the bank
The highest representatives of the Congress and the Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a widespread financial aid agreement to the American Financial System.
His vote will be held at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators have caused a break-up in the discussions on the adoption of the relief plan in their form of support for the US financial system with a amount of $7,7 billion (approximately 12 billion of colonies).
However, it is not still winned.
Congressists should make some details of the contract before they can publicly make the final form of the law and vote.
The Financial Assistance Plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He said Sunday to the Reuters Agency, Barney Frank, President of the Committee for Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before midday.
According to economics, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the advertising of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will be reached by the complex mechanisms whose market assistance will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We solve our discreptive views on the way to have the market stabilisation package" commented the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to it, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators were meeting on Sunday night with the Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, to give him a final form to the Government's Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations non-produced hypothetical assets leading to financial undertakings to hard losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the point of closing the plan convention, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already in that," said Paulson.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis is expressly involved in the market of actions lowing rapidly.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything possible so that the Congress finally approve this Sunday.
They want to calm the investors' business to the Asian financial market because these are those in the first hour and where the Congress could affect the Monday Trade.
However, there is no clearness now on when they vote the two cameras of the American Congress and, even, if they are not at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 million must be available as soon as possible, as and as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it would have the impression that the programme does not meet its role, which would be more than $100 billion and later from the last $350 million.
Bush valued the progress of meetings
On the other hand, the President may consider this decision, but the Congress may exceed its vessel by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was to win financial resources for the recovery of false hypothetical titles, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish their hypotheses.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," commented the Republicn Senator, Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush also is satisfied with the progress of meetings.
His portavoz, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the sabbath progress and values "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial market and to protect our economy".
Limitation of the blinded contract
The Chairman of the Senate Bank Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that legislators decided on the responsibilities of the programme money for the protection of taxes from losses, a submitting clauses of the programmed financial plan.
The new law should also be limited to the blind contracts for the directors of the participating society in the programme, and establish a committee that will be controlled by the Fund.
This would have to direct it to the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard in this, and we have made a great progress in direction to the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all the Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also accounts with helping home owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government would have to agree with the new hypotheses payments in order to reduce the monthly charges of debt payments and to make them possible to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to Patricia Finance's economic leader, David Marek, a good idea that will be done but quite difficult.
"And this is why you don't know what mechanism and what prices will be purchased for the problems assets.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of the next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
"That more important is that, this week, the congressists have agreed to their support and give him their view of everything before it is possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is, at these times, the most important", said Marek.
Light the armed hand: the MP3 reproductor against the mobile.
We suggest you how to choose
While almost all mobiles play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
What seems clear that it's better to buy the phone only.
There are still enough reasons for the man only buys the player.
The election depends practically on the way it uses and the demands of the future ownership.
It will probably be hard to get the most modern to hear in him the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP disks do not get out, and in respect of their quality there is no objective reason to continue buy them.
If the vinyl disks are spring in their stairs with rock, jazz or blues music, you may be dreaming at least with this type of tocadisks.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. the compressed music, simplified - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to pay eight thousand coronas in a player as well as for a Pink Floyd lovers that will hardly prove the shopping boxes of the twenty coron.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each one.
The election is wide.
The battery is also decided to decide on the battery's duration
Some of the best players have much more than just playing music and even the one that is not even the majority of the mobiles.
No current device is so universal as the phone.
In front of the most elemental functions like phone, send messages, you can play music and video, store both, have a better or worse photo device, and you can even brows.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA will have a small computer in your box also.
This is a little wonder, because no one knows how to make a parrillad and no TV can be photod.
The universality of mobiles also brings us devengeable.
How many more functions use in the mobile before the screen indicator will be illuminated by requesting to be reloaded.
And music reproduction is one of the greatest energy tragons.
Some are the mobiles that can play music more than 10 or 12 hours, most of them are less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly a greater performance.
They therefore take into account that the cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If more than that, above, they are constantly called, for more safety, a loader for the work - this is also valid for the most precious devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst suffers at least 9 hours of operation after a load.
Another problem is writing music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only one of the devices is available on the universal USB connection and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be stored directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can be connected to the small memory cards that are used in mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is needed.
Quickly fill the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players only create their order in the musical library according to the name of the interprete, the title of the album, gender, or also according to the user assessment.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structures similar to a Windows searcher and some recognize both (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intellectual phones with an operational system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment interested for the resistance of the accumulator, for the memory capacity, for quality and type of sound output and, of course, for the comfort of its handle.
If you listen, especially, the music as a background, and you will listen to her every day only a rat, as in the tranquille, then enough with any mobile that plays.
What practically gets any mobile.
It should not even be interested in the format in which mobile or player play music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and except with him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (form used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles are also possible to buy online music.
Free via the mobile web visit the operator's competent pages (or any other service provider) and is buyed a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument for buying a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offering of operators is miserable, and most are limited only to success issues of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally supposed that this way of sale of music (which by GSM, Internet or Inalmerical Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry up a mobile.
When you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your box, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it depends still on whether I can always take some auricular or at least free hands.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile even if at least a MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The cheapest costs are normally less than 3000.
Among three to four thousand coronas can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic auriculars.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with an entry of 3,5 mm. for classic auriculars, take up to 15000.
Once again, the advantage of players is not another thing that their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way the cheapest (see our selection) - really manages them any person.
The minimum functions, their handling like the previous round boxes, or also tocadics, are clear.
It is not a threat in the sense that we are wrongly connecting to the mobile and, therefore, giant account by low data.
For which device is decided
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodaphone 527) have generally a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand coronas.
But be careful.
The basic models, usually, are equipped only with a maximum 2 GB capacity card.
Only the cheapests have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you want to be buyed a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (such as maximum 2 GB) there is no need to pay more than 1.100 coronas.
If it is considered to be among the most amazing music demanders, take the hands of the most specialized mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3, which makes such a comfortable service as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman line have almost identical use as the of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and category in terms of price, over the four thousand columns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and acumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the more referred mark would be the MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will already arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is sufficiently developed, and our operators offer almost all the services as their Western partners.
However, here we have something still missing - the virtual operator, which would have to be more costful.
Maybe he'll not be late.
Checa operators are part of the most precious of Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Office of the Checa Telecommunication (STU) that warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most precious of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of the roaming rates, it is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile operators' SMS that send from the foreign will be more precise than if they send them from home.
How can the prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competence that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxy, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition on the checa market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Checa Telecommunications Office (thu), Pavel Dvośák, already expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true for a classic operator with its own network has no longer delaying possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Only the income of the virtual operator in the mobile telephone market took a decent decline of prices before which classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the income of tiburons such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Great Britain market, there have been similar voices there and here.
It was demonstrated that there is place for this type of operators and that they may have success.
On the other hand, it does not need to find too far examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the star of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after a half year, this operator gained more than 100 000 customers and became the fifth largest operator of the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta Group is the owner of the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, so they can operate effectively, they are sufficient with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not have relatively large expenditure in construction, functioning and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are normally profiled with low costs - offers cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, are often contrary to the offering of more adjusted services.
So, for example, the mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers at least half of the prices in terms of competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland can also be a good shock for something trivial meta group.
This operator is specifically directed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator that likes and in whom you can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if such a concept as Poland could be in our country.
The Vodafone's portfolio is doubtful: "The checa market is relatively small to access by segments that are based on most virtual operators.
Furthermore, from the view of the service offer is relatively saturated"
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost sure that if any virtual operator in the Czech Republic will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic is not too hopeful.
It's better about mobilking launching in other countries of our region," said in phone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničkova, port of the Penta Financial Group.
It was indirectly assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic would not endure this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible so that there is no potential competence.
Interesting on the launching of a mobile mobile operator already shows the GTS Novera group that I would like to give a step forward to become a real telephone O2 competitive in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And how much before, better.
With this possibility we have found us repeatedly with all the mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress in meetings," said the group's portal Pavel Kadl.
Then they may have a better time.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to be reached at the end of the year.
But for now your appearance is accompanied by a unexpectable wall of silence.
"In these moments, we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
To this time nobody has been directed to us with some complex and serious project on this field," he expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sscheś, telephone port O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The T-Mobile port, Martina Kemrova, in exceptional compliance with O2's view, adds: "We have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally benefited, can continue to develop."
And adds: "The T-Mobile network will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this time, we should already be on the table any concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone directs its care better to comply with the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this regards the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We precisely consider it as the greatest contribution from the customers' view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is found in the partner with whom sets a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsable Offices - with skin and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can easily be understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competitiveness that would lead to a lower prices and thus, to a decline of profits.
Then why should it facilitate the entry into competition?
When the operators want to get something, they're able to get out of the same corde, testing that is the shooting when U:fon occurred.
Maybe the biggest pressure to T-TU was at the time of the U:fon for T-Mobile society.
The public information is available on the websites of the  zu.
But exactly now U:fon serves as a argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova adds: "Before, it is not much that the competitive environment on the mobile telephone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player in the market would be for him and, in particular, for its great demands."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously disappointed because of the absolute disinterval of the Czech regulator body.
It is not only the post of TurkishTU, which, unfortunately, does not have any competence in entering on commercial contributions, in contrast with Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs to the Office for the Protection of Trade Guide (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical posture before this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile telephone market would be possible after a convention on the loan of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephone operator and a virtual operator.
Even today, no convention has been closed since the offering of the potential interested was not enoughly interesting for the classic operators," added to our question, Christián Chalupa, from the Office of Foreign Relations of the UNOHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices to represent consumer interests, it is something more than a consideration, otherwise it should be noted that no one uses their market position.
In particular when Christián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign area where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry in the market has contributed to the lowest prices of mobile telephone services"
Obviously, pressure on the correct functioning of the market media and price down does not involve UOHS interest.
Really the dramatically shocking in all this case is stressed in the desoning reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a case, it is offered by himself alone.
It is the same as the price of gas in gas lines, as it is clear that it is a work of opportunity and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and has therefore no reason for intervention.
None of the operators have therefore a dominant position with no relevant responsibilities in their market action.
The tools necessary to open the mobile telephone market to virtual operators, better, are missing as well as telecommunication regulators," added to their answer Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obvious analysis of relevant markets elaborated by the UCU that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial offering a single market.
In this type of market, naturally, no one of the checa operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - so that a virtual operator is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopolie of its network.
Therefore, in a specific segment, it must be necessaryly dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent an advertising the fact that three mobile operators are called asylum.
The current complaints of interested persons (including the GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators, they are shocked with many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in the UCU is a very common truck in the field of telecommunications which UOHS is laid down in all this matter.
We have met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, recently, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was submitted to the expansion of the competition of the UCTU in the field of commercial offers that were not brought to effect, even when a series of experts promised that the situation would be improved.
This must perfectly know the representatives of UOHS, but it is obvious that their interests are on the other hand.
It's okay, when nobody looks.
At the same time, unexpectedly works something as well as a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in the checa mobile telephone networks.
They are companies who put their own prices to mobile telephone services, but only one part are public.
Normally it is companies dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only some chosen people receive the list of prices of these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same, carrying out a large number of SIM cards.
As special customers will receive after special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all mobile telephone operators prohibit that type of return.
"If there were cases such as those quoted could be discovered in the contract conditions that could be translated to the end of cooperation with the given society," he answered the question about this issue Martina Kemrova.
But it is quite impossible that an activity of this type by mobile telephone operators would not be reached to responsible people.
Only in the case of the three enterprises mentioned can be treated by thousands of customers.
No operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these enterprises, there are nothing unprecedented gains and, at the same time, different from the authentic virtual operators - no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav śepickī warns us about the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a skilled percentage of customers.
These should also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name because you can't have him absolutely as a normal customer of operators."
That's just what you should look at the minimum strange.
Furthermore, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile phone operators turn the eyes into this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has the sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we'll stop being the most precious
As it was clear in the text, the entry of the virtual telephone operator on the market has brought a significant decline in services prices.
At the same time, almost in almost all countries where the virtual operator occurred, class operators tried to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have entered in these times, and in any of the cases, they defended operators only their customers.
There were already formal or informal pressure measures achieved that the first virtual operator would occur and with him began to happen to others.
Unfortunately, the Checo Regulation Authority is all this case happens as if it would be treated by a slaughtering clamp.
For our experience, we can't stop impressing the confusion of assignments in these cases.
But we're not going to be disappointed.
If this information is correct, and the virtual operator really arrives to these lands, then the checa market of the mobile phone probably begins to move again.
If any of the operators let any virtual mobile phone operators be difficult to remain independent of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested persons.
And we may stop calling more money than in the rest of Europe.
The new checa hino has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official heno.
On Sunday, the first Prime Minister Mirec Topolánek at the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official record of the Heno where, my home.
The new heavy recorded it the National Theater's orchestra under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions - two versions that are Solos, one men's voice and another women's voice, another with Coro and another tool.
From the song they are loaded as Kate Knśinkov and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the helm arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNeed.cz server can listen to the four versions.
Bślohlavek considers this national checo song as one of the most beautiful helloes.
The Czech Radio already said before he intentionally elected for the Solars with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"After the principle I tried with both and then, also, with the Law that is finished in the word so that the text was well understood, so that it might be conciliation," commented.
The Czech Official Henoch celebrates the next year on 175 anniversary.
The song Where, my Hogar was the first time in 1834 in the theatre of the States in the original checa Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl and corrected with the music of František šcroup.
He won popularity, and people did it.
The first stream of the song after Czechoslovakia occurred in 1918 was naturally converted into a part of the official heavy.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the appearance of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" lyn
The MHD of Praga takes us the Sunday for the first time with the chip
On Thursday, 1 October 2008, the date in which the first passengers enter the metro, the tranship and the bus with a good electronic in their boxes instead of a paper ticket.
This can be acquired in these moments by almost 1000,000 people with the Chip Opencard card.
The passengers can buy the 30 days, 90 days and the year (thete will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously loaded it in their chip card in the information centers and posts of the transport company in the Metro, Muzeum, Mśstek, Nádraí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letōany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Goods can be purchased since yesterday on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until late, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who are starting to use the Internet as a trade shape, may eventually begin to forget the sell sell positions in the metro stations, where they had to even be regularly made a collar to get out of a normal ticket.
The bonus is buyed online, and the Opencard card reloads it in some of the thirty branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers are available a ventilation with personnel prepared that helps interested persons with buying online and also with the reload of the good buyed in their card," said Martin Opatrný, the project portal.
Besides the library, you will also be able to reload the bonus electronic on the Opencard on automatic machines that are located in some metro swimming swimming machines.
How are these expenditure machines?
They are rocks, remember a swimming machine, and travellers will probably have already been fixed on them in the stations of Roztyly, Budæjovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There is in the city five, but at the end of the year, it would have to have 80", completed Opatrný.
The good is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Quick to introduce in it the Opencard card and the previously paid card will be loaded only in it.
The good electronics since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
It is, in bus trains and bus lines from the 300 to 499 which are mainly used by the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviews equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of time and the area of the good," explained the control of the shoes, Philip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which sets the times of Prague's collective transport.
Circular buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's taste.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place to it on the side of the Box.
In this way, the driver controls the validity of the good.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the goods there is nothing easier than requesting the driver this information", completed Drapal.
The passengers who do not travel in the circle bus and don't remember when the validity of the good is completed can be directed to expenditure machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, in the machine screen, the information on the validity of your document will be shown.
South-East wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
German Swedens requested in 1945 that Fumaba was part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the U.S. Patrone.
With this desire, some of the Swedish German groups were presumablely addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
Results of the letters that are stored in a particular file and are now saved in the collection of the South Bohemia Science Library.
The Germans from Krumlov requested a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of "the Territory Šumava" - who is employed by Hitler based on the Munich Pact - again in Czechoslovakia.
"We have understanded the situation correctly and we really want their word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemy, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed with a "the people who bring the destination of Šumava in their heart".
In view of the unity of Checoslovakia with the Southern Germans, it is presumablely - the Czech National Charter - a hope only in brutality, desconsideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors swear in the letter to the American President who smile for today and forever in Zhumawa under a protective.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we deliver to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in absolute cooperation with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumablely the fear of reprise of the "tschean oppressors".
If the President of the United States presumably doubts this idea of shomavous Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patron.
Despite the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have today in the history of poguera, we can feel a little child, according to some experts, the expectations of the Germans in the South of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuite at least that they would be treated on their expulsion from the Republic only some of them accepted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate any clear way of autonomy for the Sudans.
Others believed that they would stay in Czech Republic.
It is also confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in śeské Budōjovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budæjovice, rolled into the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war, the Britishs arrested him and moved him in the field of German prisoners for decades, they were at him to teach them in Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the cheek would sell them well," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had found that, on the basis of the Benes Decrees, they would be displaced from the Republic.
I don't think - pay it!
Emotive campaign attacks drivers
The most fair action in the Czech history leads to security on the roads.
This could be characterized by the emotive campaign that decided to start Monday the Ministry of Transport in the Mediterranean.
The Department's office, Alleš śebæek, promises that it will disappear dangerous conductors to the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will be feeling on television, radio, cinema, internet and telephones.
I would have to disappear the driver of high speed and alcohol to the flight.
And also to remind you that before you move, the cintrums are waited.
It wants to be aware of all young drivers, motorists, peatants, and finally also of professional drivers.
What is what we can see in the ads?
Basically human historys that employ emotions.
And for that, they witness the "saguinary" ads during the whole campaign:
I don't think - pay it!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters in the matrix.
And in a blood lock, it's the word "pagas".
This must symbolize that man at a moment of dispense can get to pay with his own life.
Advertising will be "measuring" to the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was left to inspire the campaign carried out in anglesajonous land where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
Promise that in this way the accidents and the number of dead on the checa roads will be reduced.
Advertisements have been developed by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and latties for drivers
"To drivers, the sugar and latigo system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a seed is happening in red and so takes time.
Latigo is a threat to a lot of accident.
The drivers must remember the risks," says the hospital's psicologist Na Homolce, Martin Kośán.
And therefore there is an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
The less effective, for him, are the panels that advertise the driving of dangers.
"If there is any installed panel warning of any danger probably soon will be fusioned with the environment and the driver will not give you greater attention," warned Koōán.
Olmert would return almost all the areas that are employed in change of peace
The President of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, proclaimed about the refund of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, namely West Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in change of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
I propose in the interview that Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach a agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all the lands (occupied) if it is not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We shall certainly remain with a hundred percent of these lands, but to the Palestinians, we shall deceive them a hundred similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be peace," he added.
He acknowledged that the Jerusalem would also be included in the case of the refund.
"Whoever he wants to be safe in Jerusalem and therefore did not want the tractors or scatters to pass above his feet as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in reference to the two attacks of July in the city where there were several dead and decades of people were damaged.
According to the President, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple colline, holy and historic place" situated within the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty in the whole city will be to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he stressed further.
Retreat of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert was also expressed by the retirement of Israel from the Golan Highs, which from its view is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also include concrete efforts by Damasco.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan retirement," warned.
"Syrians know well what they'll have to be disappointed to win Golan.
They must leave their current relationships with Iran, leave their relationships with Hizbula (Chita movement) and should be dealt with the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (terrorism network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the first minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the shoes illegal in bus?
The law is unknown, you can't walk in a long distance bus
With regard to the tragic accident of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Patva, we will ask whether the bus and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the azafata is opposed to the vial transit law," says the portal of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the last week died the slaughter of twenty-five years, obviously, was caused by the truck driver only that the bus was crossed on the path.
The girl, unfortunately, was sit next to the driver at the less safe place of the vehicle, despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or driving swiftly, and at the precise time that the slaughter departs the coffee or the newspapers.
Here's what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with foot places.
If the bus is not authorized, the passenger must be sit down.
The long-distance buses from the Student Agency have no shooting sites, which confirmed the director of the company, Radin Jančura, to Update.cz.
"This we have solved it with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this took it and we arrived to the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom when the bus is on the move if they have a sit," commented our position.
Asaphate does not know the law
" There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafate - no legal provisions cover this role.
There is no legal provision for any transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of revision of vehicles whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds less thoroughly the Hanzelka port.
The Director of the Trafficking Department on Transports, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law is sufficiently attracted to this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has the authorisation allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," says.
Buses are divided between the urbans, where there are places to be a maximum foot and speed, interurbans with places to be swimming with a higher speed permit and long distances without foot, with the higher speed permit and the seats equipped with a safety ring.
As in the flight, the expert says
The expert of EESIP in the safety of transport, Jaroslav Hośín, does not see important problems with regard to the movement of assaphate in the bus.
"The situation can be compared to aircraft services during travel development is not a great threat.
Not even here there is the safeness that the turbulences arrive and that the snack can be shocked in the head."
"Indeed, if the bus is obviously free that physical laws are valid.
Same as in a urban bus or in the tranquily.
The security of the slaughter must solve the internal regulation of the transporter," said and also thinks that this problem is unsolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter that offers azafates service.
She works in him to two hundreds.
The director, nor after the accident, considers that rare work.
"But yet, at the time when it has the impression that the azafate position is strict, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when they enter.
I would even pay expenditure," says.
In terms of security, Asian is the reason why there is no azafates in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which leads to a small line in comparison with SA.
"We have no snacks, we are against them since the beginning.
Before or later, this will end in a dead accident," said less than one year ago to Tøden.cz.
There was a great tragedy.
On the line accident that one in Napolis died a young slaughter of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the station cart by locking the walk to the bus. without using intermittees.
His driver tried to prevent it, however, with the right front side.
Jančura refuses to sell the two sites that are booked for the relaxation of the azafata.
"This sites are not possible to book them for long distance connections, are blocked."
The company intends to ask the car driver.
The Agency will not wait for the case of the court on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenditure also by the guilt.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more accuracy to the movement of the azafate in the bus, where 30 members are working for a group of the Department of Transport.
" However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
It is not too much dedicated to bus, but better to the point system, maximum speed in car and the use of the mobile during the walk," says the experts Hośin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of slaughters in a major way changes the safety of passengers," concluded Hanzelka's portavoz, that the security control in bus is the police and the Security Office in the work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Francfort
In the letter of the West LB joint directive for its collaborators, there are no major words.
For the fusion of Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA Bank, it can be formed as a central capital market of Sparkassen financial group, as says in the writing, published on Monday.
The West LB Bank, broken the 'competitive block' with sustainable benefits capacity would enter into such business.
In addition, such a fusion may be a start for the following fusions in the field of regional banks.
The text is understood when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because the same as before the West LB is under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also of the Federal Institute of Financial Service Monitoring which has not been clearly made to the Government of North Western Renaissance, which is a short time to find a solution.
Since a long time ago, as well as the Francfort part, it speaks about the unions of such types between the DEKA bank, that Sparkasis customers know for their investment funds, and West LB.
Indeed, Frank Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, left out that no sense in the fusion of the bank, located on the Mainzer Street Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
However, the DEKA Administration Board, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen's associations, engaged in negotiations with West LB on common trade activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or some of its parts.
Of course, the negotiations have just started, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time that it is the consolidation in Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank, which with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs in the Francfort financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could fusion with the Renania-Palatinado regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to establish a three-party unity has remained without results.
Only the plans were public, and the Government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Renania-Palatinado began the dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always again played with the DEKA bank fusion idea with other regional banks.
But finally, the President of the Helaba Joint Directive, Ohther Merl, expressed that he was against the coexistence plans with his bank.
Independence of that seems to be more clear that the unification of the various banks in the field of public law is necessary.
So, when the Baviera Parliament elections, the BayernLB Union with the Regional Bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba that results not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to fusion, Helaba will miss the partners to do that.
In the south of the bank, it could be only a young partner, although even now it was much better than the financial crisis that made it the immuebles of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which has 85 percent of Helaba, avoided coexistence plans with West LB.
In any case only the North LB is left.
But such geo-strategic reflections are only one part.
This is also the compatibility of the various bank models.
In June, Merl made a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, which the German Sparkassen and Giro Verband did not answer until now.
Finally the West LB can be discomponed, but that is, of course, not the own desire of the bank.
In this way, in the letter of the joint bank Directive, it is also said that it would try to find a full solution for the whole bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA, this will show the time.
The second weekend of October Fest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he loved Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, says he.
After them, on the side of a 5 litres of the Kaiser brand bird barrier is built a huge tiger that shows nearly 200 participants of October feast that sounds lowly knows producing in their gargant.
First Elena gives Luca a palmed, then a cup.
From the Bolivia arrived to Verona.
From there, from the accommodation next to the train station Porta Newa, this night at 23:45 goes three buses, 'direction Munich, the bird party', which is expected to arrive at 6:30 of the morning.
Three buses are predicted, especially for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the skins of the apartment side of his band are sing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating night.
With a lot of pleasant, Marco Watch says, that is nothing for Italians.
In Marco, who takes a long board with an artificial skin fore and skin with plate color balls, belongs to these buses.
Since five years ago, they come to October, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
From night on the way there, during the day in the rain, at 22:30 a.m.
Past the night there means only the unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the receipt of welcome with a Kaiser bird that was done according to the Baviera's cleaning law, the disease safe and the guide in German-Marco attended a language course in Francfort.
Tonight buses are already on the road on the car with the "Brennero" address
There's no bird, yet not.
Real peace in the bus quickly, travellers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It is to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian matrix make another break on the 8-low car.
Finally, when the Marco Group has arrived at 6.30 p.m. on the accommodation next to the Prade of Teresa, there are some 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Lucas and the others gather, Marco has his last talk about the way to go.
First, put a gorge.
There, from the left, it is written "Oktoberfest", on the side of the geotical letter is the page of the Mark’s travel office on the Internet: "knowsesiviando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the camping store are open, that means marking!", Marco crys on the lunch.
"Mark!" Mark and busy the back sites in the campsite.
"Do not take the front sites, because we're gonna lock, and everyone with earliest gorge don't seen you in the same banky, divided through all space!"
A blue letter, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the propina
Show the security people that we have a good ton!
Once you get out of his site, he will be already busy!"
Third: "This afternoon is exactly at the ten and a half you have to come here!" Have you heard?
And now everyone goes to October.
One, to mark the path, shoot the smells in the trees, traffic signals and even in a card of the choices of a large Baviera Popular Party.
You want to recognise the way behind.
It's the second weekend of October Feste known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no precise data on the number of persons; it is 500,000 people traveling over the Alpes and tormentally entering the campaign shops, 10 percent of all arrived this weekend in Italy.
The police of Munich receives assistance from seven polices from the Autonomy Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Baviera which makes a statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, before English (circumcised 60 assistance) and Austrians take the first place.
The favorite sale of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbrüuselt.
Unless sleeping nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stabil, only the Federal Minister for Finance Peter Steinbrück last week.
Well, that the policy would use the word "relationally" and added that the German banking area will also affect the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s immune finance, which is covered in the DAX index, receives a consortium of German banks a thousands of dollars to be able to resist to turbulences on the market.
Monday, a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid was up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use must be interested.
The money also produces as private banks from public law.
This is the cause of the losses of the Depfa filial.
According to a report, state finances with the money provided for long-term projects have financed them only a short period - which is now, because of the uncertainty of markets, it is not possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank's capital reserve decreased in 95 per cent, EUR 2,37 million, also the share of the capital own decreased a little of 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period of the last year, the continuing income of financial investment and net benefits of financial operations falled up to zero, the debt tax revenues and some value titles also resulted in the dissolving of the provisions of credit businesses of more than 70 percent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many income of the compensation costs of the ex-Depfa restructuring, as well as for the reimbursement of interests in accordance with the Federal Tax Code and the organizational businesses for consortium enterprises, the negative wage could acknowledge a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former State finance was lost in spectrums with industrial credits for immovials, which was due to the foundation of the Aareal Bank.
As much money could be winned with the financing of state projects, Defa began intensely dedicating projects in infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors, as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to be encouraging on the value of the subsidiary that will have a “essential effect” on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is very clearly said.
It's a fact that they canceled the dividends.
They were already cancelled by two thirds for the year 2007.
After the purchase of the Depfa, the Real Estate Hypo Real became a major state and financial financial in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not have customer deposits, he is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market, compared with other banks.
With the chief of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank credits was essentially slow because the banks were swearing their liquidity.
Each year, Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit cards of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate's report, the bank covers the need for financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially not suitable to operate"
Other sources say that refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009 by this money.
Georg Funke, President of the Real Estate Joint Directive, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the time possible.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are part of the basis that Hypo Real Estate Group's competitiveness is assured from now.
That must be waiting for shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamic and the insubstantiveness of the crisis there is no perceivement.
It is even imaginable that there is no need to be financing in its full volume.
But the other case cannot be excluded.
It would be the voice that at last Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so the temporary salvation can not be quiet at least concerned.
The price of action was 75%, EUR 3.30.
Rating courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost not changed, the rates of loans according to the position in the ownership registration are clearly low.
Affected are mostly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo, and with the reasons of the lendings of 2009.
After the significant growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa affected by the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that had previously been an investment for speculations must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While embassy banks, Governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, as far as pension amortization can be taken within a period of time.
Or something will happen, which is not angry to imagine anyone - the financial crisis will exceed in the next 15 months.
But when we see the crossed news on the partial statistics, now the security that is already in its limit has become a justificated hope.
This will be a reason, because the creditors will pass the night without sleeping, broken the head on the decision about their enthusiasm isolation.
Even short-term investmentrs can put the final point and use new losses transport for the next payments of benefits compensation taxes for the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to be presented at the Tacibana High School, the girls began to ride: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she accounts in Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was afraid before I went to the college.
I live at the border of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I'm going to train 40 minutes at high school Tachibana.
I had to find the way, for luck I didn't lose.
It seems that the start of the classs is not fixed as strict as in my home, in Baja Sajion.
From the eighth morning, students, at least ninety-two, start a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I had touched me to present me.
Furthermore, I am not a person who speaks with much fun in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the uniform schooler, I put an old sweet of the mother of my anfitrion family and also a blue, blue calcetines and black shoes of skin.
So, my clothes put me to the poll and I tried to speak all correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I call Sylvana, I am from Germany and one week will be my birthdays.
At this moment I was very happy because for the years I had started study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have kicked, king and signs and all the time I heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew my Mangas.
This belongs to the Japanese dictionary of survival and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I was slowly displaced on my site.
The girl on the side had a great dream, for she was a honour that the girl of exchange had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really shocked.
Everyone talked at the same time, urged and made a lot of questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, in the recreation, they were all their Blessings.
My family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that burned pieces of German pane.
I had a sweet with iron, small sweets, pepine salt and algas, fruit and something like meat in tofu mass.
In most cases, I don't have any idea of what this is here in Japan.
The things are rare and have a new sweet.
What is sure is that everything is very rich.
So, maybe with exception of marine circles in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools the stages are not just a lunch.
Sometimes, a girl prepares a blessed worked very artistic way for a boy and is in hope of being able to know him better during a recreation.
I read that in my Manga-Comics.
I'm so curioso to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked me my friends when I told you I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then I always answered:
"Good, because I'm fascinating."
Finally, for years I prefer to read Mangas.
To better understand the comics and culture, one day I started study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a flag for tradition and habitat.
Here they have a great value.
One part, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, and otherwise it is a serious, disciplinary and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a kitchen feeling the danger slows, why did you also fear?
Joseph Le Doux, scientist in neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they act in the similar way to us, feel the same?
In a internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers selected to the question What do you think what is true without proving it?
I think the animals have feelings and other conscious states without me or someone else can prove it until now, although we can not even prove that others have conscience.
But in this case we can at least wait for it because all human brains present the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicated to other species, and we include questions on feeling and generally on conscience, we enter into the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: the dead is done, flee or attack.
People are conducted in such a manner, so some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contain our subjective experience to the animals.
First, almost always they include circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal plot of the cerebral cortex (from their participation in the short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This wide range is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
In view of at least the aspects mentioned in our conscience that depends on the prefrontal log of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suggest that even the man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the human language nature: as most of its experience is associated with the language, it often means that conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the conscience of the animals, created as well, would in many cases differ from the majority of our conscious states.
Therefore it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, nor let you measure because you have the special hardware, nor let you analyze through our experiences, so your research presents great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consistent experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the conscience that would be more easy for scientific research.
Animal conscience processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and this is what happens during short primates memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it is essential to the neutral correlations of conscience than the cause mechanisms: both may be similar or not.
Currently this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal luxury of the brain cortex for the training of visualization.
And what's the result of that for feelings?
I have the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is responsible for this, the same thing happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the brain activity is employing a space of the defence system (or its consequences, for example, the reactions of the body).
Since this point of view, the feelings are very fixed by the brain cortex which distinguishes primates and especially the whole man.
From the point of view of the language nature, we continue to classify the final sense because we can distinguish and classify states with the words and graphics to enable to describe the states of others to ourselves.
Antonio Damasco, for example, thinking that the feelings originate from the simple activity of the heart rate which means of the body vessel and from the throat of enemy, he'll think Jaak Pankseep, but it's more focused on the thrombolic thrombolet.
As this network has not been long changed during human evolution, it can be absolutely referring to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I think it's not likely.
Pakseep argus that what rats and men feel like fear, may be feeling in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men act like that?
When you see the danger, a kitchen run, you know why she's scared?
I believe that the likeness of conduct is not yet testing the likeness of experience.
That is true that the neuron aid comparison: rats and men have similar encephal throwings, cockets on the other hand have no at least one brain.
Is it the throat of the encephal that is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, possibly also the kitchens (who knows it?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats that emotional feelings because their feelings are essentially distinguished from us (for human conscience refers to special circles and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the area of neurology while the same rats and men are seen.
As I do not invest the language and the consciousness of rats, and feelings, I don't know whether they exist.
It can be said that I don't see any more outside my narcs, but I prefer to progress to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotive.
The President of the EUFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Prime Minister, said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government looks at the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence of Ukraine's capacity to organize the European campaign together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But that is not an amniist for our country.
Now the work is starting, and in the two countries there is much to do."
The time of construction and reconstruction of stations, streets, hotels and airports in the anfitrion countries is cooked.

Dumping Dennis Quaid Contrattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about private life and has problems with her ex-marry: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan designed her ex-marine as an adulster.
It's enormous and contra-attacked.
The late war of the two rocks in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors of Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan was announced for the first time about the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knows the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: "This is an audit that Meg accounts for how many times the story of our relationship in another version," said the man of 54 years to "New York Daily News".
Among other things are very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "I will remember in public pain and changes, everything means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married, and just a few years ago he is Dad of Gemmels.
And so ends with his statements by emphasising: "See as my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's good."
The prices of airlines and hotels are down
In the first half of 2008, the aircraft and the pernotations in Europe were more costing than comparing the last year.
According to a current study, aircrafts in Germany were low up to 50 percent.
The aircraft and the pernotations in hotels were re-established - this is the result of a study of the travel services provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reserve data of the first half of 2008, and after the increased prices in the first quarter, the company noted a great change in the second half.
After many years the hotel market prices continued to increase, the pernotations in many sites were worthy.
In comparison with the last year, the prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased in average 6,9 percent.
From April to June the prices have already dropped up to 3.6 percent comparing the last year.
The trends were more perceptive in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the debilitated dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of the US tourists in traveling reduced."
The reduction of the prices of hotels is also more noted in financial centres such as Francfort or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norway city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 per cent and thus spend a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the aircraft prices also showed the upward trends:
Because of the increase in the prices of the Economy class travellers, 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long distance flights were even more costly to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of aircraft in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped at average 12,5 percent, but the price changes for the business class and the First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February the prices increased to 11.9, in the second half of the half, 23.6 per cent.
According to a study, the prices for national flights in Germany even reduced half.
The cause of price change is one part of the increase in the fleet economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the market with the flight, the demand is down.
On the other hand, there is a great competence for the Open-Skies Treaty that liberalizes the traffic between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tense is the cancellation of non-proliferative distance flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in Quiebra - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia is still not going to make the decimoprezer gol.
Christffer Klein was very well presented the forced aterrice of the player of the national Marko Martin selection.
Gladbach player started playing late and failed to make a gol.
Everything I wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, you could read it clearly from your lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second gol", Silbaba Hermann Rieger in the chain in the Hamburg stadium.
I don't pass anything special in the catacubs, the time of relaxing ended and most of the present were again on its sites.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapy, very much reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
So his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant trainer attended his head and led the teeth in a warning sign.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the main trainer of Hamburg.
Your order was the same: go, the second gol!
But that was not done.
"How wasn't everything pleased to see," he added after Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more disappointed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and the situation that the Gladbach team was very weak could not show its entire strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"This was a Swiss victory," said Mr. Martin Jol.
This Monday, Hamburg's SV will meet its 121 years.
The Saturday of being the spectacles had already celebrated their own, the blue sky on the stadium and the table change in the video screen.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It is expected that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the ability of the link than the domination of its HSV.
The chip with its bound players later like Neves and Silva, the Petric Golector, and Jansen, who was removed from FC Bayern, needs time to join, but the chip can still not light with its success.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling," requires Jol.

Dark material affects the trayectory of space sounds
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon causes the unconsciousness to researchers: the Dark Material affects the speed of space sons during this time called serious assistance to the maneuver.
The experts are afraid that Albert Einstein's Relative Theory can't be so correct.
The space son of "Ulysses" passed almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel tubers are now shutting the threat to death in the fridge.
Since years ago, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravity assistance to manobra, causes the disconsciousness of researchers.
The serious assistance is a manipulation of space sons trayectory while they obtain a acceleration by using the energy of the gravity field of a planet, for example.
This allows space sounds to burn fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space survey used this physical truck as well as the Sun Ulysses's son.
But what's surprised by researchers for many years: the missiles are not conducted by 100 percent, as they are expected according to the venerable pregnancy law.
Better frequency are irregularities of the speed.
Sounds have higher or lower speed of improvisedness.
Physicals could not explain this effect until now.
They called it anomality during the serious assistance to the manipulation.
Some experts are afraid that even the general Theory of Albert Einstein's Relativeness, which describes the force of atraction of the material through space curvature, cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American Physical of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, believes just now as before Einstein did not confund and tried to explain the anomaly during the serious assistance with so called Dark Materie, in what were the astronomies in the universe.
"The reason of anomaly may be the Dark Material that can also be very close to the Earth," he wrote.
The researchers of the universe know the existence of the Dark Material only for 10 years.
It is supposed to have the attraction force and its influence can be observed in other planets.
The Dark Material, on the contrary, is completely invisible what means that it does not send and does not reflect any electrical radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark material is at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The secundary tourists in Egypt are free
As the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Italy confirmed, after ten days in the hands of secutors, the settled tourists in Egypt should be freed.
Sudan seculars had requested a million savings.
Six securities should be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are secuted in the south of Egypt.
The negotiations on rescue have already started.
Germans are always on the point of attention of the students.
The WELT ONLINE magazine refers to the most important cases.
For this reason, European tourists in Sahara are free.
In this regard, the same information presents the state television of Egypt, the embassy of the Arab TV Al-Arabija and the Italian communication media.
After the news on liberation in the Italian episode Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our civilians and other rehenses are free.
'We are controlling your health status now' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as eight Egyptian partners are well and are in security, inform the state of Egyptian television.
The 19 participants in the wilderness are on the path to Cairo.
What is incomprehensible is the reasons of a shot before the release of the rehenses: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the seculars were ready to end up with the secular, but the Sudan army suddenly killed six seculars.
"The problem was solved.
They were in accordance with the rescue," said the guard.
It was just "receive the rehens" when suddenly came "This surprise."
Thursday, the Sudan soldiers killed six secutors and two of them have been arrested in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The students requested the savings in the amount of six million euros from Germany; the money had to deliver the German wife from one of the residents.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the seculars feared their security.
According to the report, the secutors are intentioning to release women from women after receiving the rescue.
The men had to stay arrested until the seculars had a safe route to run.
The German Ambassador in Cairo refused to take the position to this report.
Mother's abuse "He brought to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse for his father brought a woman to kill himself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years of stithians in Cornwall, was sentenced to five years of prison after she acknowledged eight indecent attacks.
The Real de Truro Court, through an injury study, knew that he had regularly acted with his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl had between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I'm responsible for her death."
The court knew that Mrs. Randle was suicided in his house of Mutley in Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34 years.
At the time when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to shoot her and sell his eyes before he carried his sexual acts, while his mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a large part of his time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, had suffered by the abuse that had been inflicted him twice a week.
In 2006, the Inspector Ramsey Quaife mentioned the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about it, that after being a great surfist and cyclist, he now seemed to be "emotionally dead", as if he had "renumbered life".
In April 2007, her true father, Terraza Randle, found the woman who died in his apartment of Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle was in front of his daughter's father, who wrote a confesion letter that was concluded, saying, "I was shooting her and swearing her eyes.
It was never a sexual attack.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange pheticist, and for your victim must have been a surprising experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ended with the victim by leaving his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she didn't do it, probably the question would not have ended in the courts."
He added: "I noticed the effect that, according to the description made by the father and the mother of Stephanie, abuse was about her daughter over the years.
Clearly she would have been able to have a promised, successful and happy future."
A official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a official of the Gaviet Office, who forgot some secret documents on the train in June, would be accused under the Act on Official Secrets.
The man, on working travel by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed to BBC before they were sent to the police.
This is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not require any indication of the intent of crime.
The BBC corresponsary for the Defense Frank Gardner said that the sentence had come as a surprise for many in the English administration.
"Think it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Gavine," said.
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Law, the clause referred to in the guard of information.
The Real Jurisdiction noted that the official should be accused of the Metropolitan police because of the high sensitive entity of its work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and security forces in Iraq.
The official was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B & B
In Britain, construction companies could be faced with a price of more than 800,000 external libraries after the rescue/relief of the Bradford bank and Bingley bank.
Indeed, the Government provided 14 billion libraries to protect the deposits of 2.6 million bank slaughterers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the borrowers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humily" that society and its members must pay
On the other hand, the 14 billion loan should be paid after the Bradford and Bingley hypothesis are refined.
However, the interests to be in the Enterin are loaded every year to the 700 financial enterprises which have deposits.
The Financial Service Indemnization Plan confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies were included in that number.
It is humble that the institutions that were conducted with prudence... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been very less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
This means that each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Deputy estimates that the interest in the loan will exceed 450.000 sterlin libraries in 2009.
This means that societys will have to recover 81.000 sterlin libraries to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Societys, declared the BBC that this situation is injust.
"It is humble that the institutions that have been fully conducted in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were very less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data that indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will have the need to consider all the aspects of this matter in the next weeks to find out what options exist to protect the construction society and their members against what could be a relevant price", added Mr Cole.
The interest covered in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demandable interests, which may be almost two times more.
As organizations of mutual construction companies and not shareholders, their members will end inevitablely by paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their loans.
The milk price below five pens per litre
Jersey's people will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the most precious of milk products will increase the litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase in this year, after an increase in two pensions in February and after investigations carried out by an advisory company.
Traders may decide whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the largest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denied freedom under fidelity to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh Court rejected the request of freedom under fidelity for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it may be led to prison when returning to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him the freedom under fidelity accusing him of extortion of $50 million ($729,700) to a employer when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various corruption accused to his charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was placed under fidelity at the beginning of this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but its party, the Awami Liga, has required that the Government of the country, militaryly supported, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondentals say that while the conditional freedom was given to go to the foreign and receiving medical treatment, it is not clear now what are the terms of their release or if it will be able to stay free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make a appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of freedom under fidelity for Sheikh Hasina, claiming that it could not obtain freedom under fiance because he was already treated in the foreigner under conditional freedom," said its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to make a appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His defenders argued that she needed the freedom under fidelity to return to her country from the foreign country and to prepare for the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her patriarch after October 17, as a leader of the Awami Liga last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provincial government, supported by the army, took the power, but was placed in June to go to the foreign and receiving medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are accused.
The fears for the campaign against poliomiliti in Afghanistan
About 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the United Nations - have not been able to use a recent anti-poliomilite vaccination campaign because of the Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not be reached in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in South for security reasons.
One United Nations porter said that it was unlike the promises made by the Talibans that had not been attacked or hindered by thousands of officials while they carried out vaccinations.
BSkyB lost legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Commission of Competence after the decision that the company had to reduce its participation in the radio-distribution ITV rival.
The BSkyB has been informed by the Competence Appeals Court to reduce its participation of 17.9 per cent in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB interests prevent competition and enabled its unlawful influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL now Virgin Media in purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of participation in ITV by BSkyB was weapons doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedie, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have been delivered its vote rights.
New investigation in support of American lawyers
The United States Inspector General has appointed a special lawyer to investigate the delay of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The reason was that the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action by the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed by political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Norajarehy is investigating whether the questionned officials during the investigation have held investigators in the attempt to prevent justice.
"True complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been completely investigated or resolved", says the General Prosecutor Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special applicant with the power to bind the witnesses to leave their statements.
The debate began when nine American lawyers were removed from their duties by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed by low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues of their colleagues, and many observers made the conclusion that the delays would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked in the persecution of some Republicns, high profile members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the complaints of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and judicial cases for the Government
and may be disappointed at any time, but not removed by political reasons.
The next Chief of the Department of Justice, Ombudsman General Alberto Gonzales, rejected his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Prosecutor General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in this matter, and stressed how he had a "prior responsibility" for the disappointments, which "administered" of his leadership position and was "notably not cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Co-operator of Bush, were criticized because they did not cooperate with the research.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honour
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored in the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The songant, who will collect the special premium next week in the ceremony that will be held in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "a honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triunfed in 1977.
The Coldplay Group is taking candidates to the premiums of this year and make the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor of the Q magazine, said, " There are some songs that overcome time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent voice capacity as used by Meat Loaf.
A instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the heavy.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and began to be number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained some nine years in the classifications and began to sell more than 40 million copies throughout the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in the past years, including a surgery operation for his heart arthmia in 2003, after a concert.
In 2007, a slow laringite forced him to cancel some concerts.
Afterward, it appeared that he had a chest in his vocale corner.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and maybe ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, bulvars, streets and other ways, some famous, other simple service.
However, to many, including veterinary taxists and local long-term residents, it is difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the north of the Prime Calle – before I found the Second Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenida.
This street, more than 30 feet width and 120 feet long, is seen to a powdery rueджon more than a active way.
There are no signs.
It's almost impossible to find in a rat.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the Prime Calle
which wants to repay Extra Place and create a clean shopping shopping and shopping that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include older neighbors that they began to be loved by the trunked cart simply because it is one of the last remains of the past block before the buildings appropriate.
However, the Department of Viving, Reservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Vencidad Community Committee for the use of the land this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency made a proposal for buying the street.
However, by prefering that the street remains to the city, the Committee requested a new plan that will be presented in the next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager.
"The city is propietary today of very few spaces and we would like to continue to have Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to address the problem and to manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, while waiting for rental spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first occurred during the meeting of this month
But Michele de Milly, a port of Avalon Bay, said that, despite the company wanted to use the street, he didn't want to have it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewing of this abandoned street and the possibility of converting it into a public area," said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a port of the Reservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire from the city to sell the street and noted that the Agency ' s mission was the development of the property more than the management.
In comparison with its more color surroundings, the Bowery's Bowery, Extra Place has left a sleeves in the history.
Some believed that I obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large ownership was shared between his children and this close land-wreck has not been claimed by anyone.
The behind door of the CBGB, the rock rock monument which was closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street may be better known by the photography of the establishment that comes in the cup of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who issued the photo in November 1976.
"I was filled with cup, pieces of clothes and pieces of barriles, cards, sheets, clouds."
Some residents, including bloggers who write on East Village's accommodation, have opposed the idea to sell Extra Place, arguing that the public, even modest, must remain public.
Others have joyed Extra Place as rare pieces, almost without changes, a city king that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who directs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A bebérly Nostalgic Look at a city in the Going Extinct Process"), has made a part of a charla of the city’s history on Extra Place, published by the New York Journal in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, writes: "Extra Place is a little close and unexpected street, dark as well as the day, and marked by the doors of oxided and counterventure, with old weekly newspapers along the channels."
With a few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was closed through the back of the street and stopped near the door used to enter the CBGB, which now takes a luxury clothes store.
Graphites on the walls and a empty bird bottle nearby 22-oce were near a new lote of displaced newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarly took attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that they could be able to give him a clean.
Mr. Fields, on his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I passed the best years of my life," said, "in dark, humid and smell places."
The debate on bilinguism: inemersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the positions of candidates on bilingue education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elderly associated in studies on California, and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-auteur of the book "Note as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
A difficult business is to call Spanish voters effectively.
The proposals for education made by Barack Obama are the example of this.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "the Africans and Latin Students have significantly less likely to graduate than the white students," and this is a very proper consideration.
In order to combat such differences in the events of learning, Obama's education plan specifically advises, inter alia, "the bilingual transition education" for the English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the bilingual education commitment, prefering in school instruction in different languages from English, is effective to cancelle distance in the final results.
We take, for example, Sexth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the Eastern region of Los Angeles.
In this school the vast majority of students are Spanish and family with low interests:
more than a third of students, many of whom recently arrived, are learning English.
However, a surprising 100 percent of the fourth year students has been evaluated positively in 2008
and almost one amazing 93 percent has dominated the test of English and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that has been favoured by Mr Obama.
The Sexth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the continuing evaluation of competitives and does not touch any attitude of excuses.
Furthermore, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the main of the sixth Calle, the approach of the English school to education to students is in the "total inherence".
Inmersion in England means almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of instruction contents.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingue education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students as this last, which has arrived from Mexico, and that if you enter the 12 months later you would not be able to collect what it was."
"Function," she said, "We believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Spanish-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should take any doubt about the response, but the idea of their party's policy on education (National Education Associations have been long-term defenders of bilateral education) and its continuing support for bilateral education is the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
Although immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue by allowing people to stop worried about the legislation that is only written in English.
and instead of that, he said, "You must ensure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and closure the lagunas, it should be carefully considered the educational models that work well, more than disrespect them or trivialize them.
The oil price falls brushly after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastly decreased this month because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets can not be able to reactivate the economy.
Cross oil actions reduced from 7 percent, reaching $99.80 the barriel in the morning negotiation at the New York Market Exchange.
The price has decreased more than $20 per barrill since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the basic product markets have been covered by the financial crisis in Wall Street and for a couple of powerful huracans in the Golf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 by barriel in July, prices had fallen nearly $90 by barriel at the beginning of this month before they returned, once again, because of the great incertitude in the financial markets.
The anxiety was supported by the investors, once again, the Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress that they said had come to an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the greatest in the history.
The news was understood by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far away.
The development that has occurred in the last episode of the fusion process confirms that the City Group will buy the Wachovia Corporation bank operations, as the Government said this Monday.
At the same time, Belgium, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European Force Financial Conglomerate.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that in the frenetic end of the week, the negotiations that leaded to the rescue agreement seemed to have not been able to reactivate the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation is deteriorated, it is expected that the demand for basic products, including oil.
"The perspectives for global equity, the interest rate and change will be increasingly incerted," the German Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products can't escape this account.
From the perspective of products, our more accurate concern is the evaluation if American virus will be distributed worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the prevention of oil and gas price reduction is of 20 percent for 2009.
Second locure room: equipment set record
After passing, during the last eight times, more time than no one in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Elis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things are developed in the second fourth this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without a note in a game of desinflaring.
"I have never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second fourth started after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona had played with pericia under the clouds.
At this time, the Quarterback Brett Favre found in Laveranues Coles by performing a half of 12 miles and suggesting the perfect burden for a late, in which the evolution of relationship between players had a great shock forward.
It would be found to Coles for two more targets in the room, one of these when a cornerback falls and the other came with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't go out of my way," said Favre of all steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, independently of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were played on the charge, the defense of the Cardinals was untreated to the Quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a shooting shot and returned 32 pounds for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last turning, Bowens' lacks, could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets returned the bathroom, Jay Feely gave him a 20-millions to win a definitive 34-0.
It's the biggest points that the Jets never did in a room.
At the team trainer, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the crazy of this moment, said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without reply in the third - Mangini said, "I can say that I enjoyed the second fourth than the third.
They won a lot of points in a very short time period."
Burrselasie heads its global record
Once again, Haile Bergselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider him the largest runner of history, exceeding their own world record in the Berlin march this Sunday and become the first person able to run the car at 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the swimming car rental in 2:03:59, Bergerlasie has destroyed by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Burserlassie has established the global record number 26 in a pressing long-term road, so that he has established a global campeonate or a world record for any distance, from the contrary road to the marathon.
Last month, Burserlassie did not participate in the olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - maybe too alarming - that air pollution of the asthma would increase its problems.
Instead, he was put to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - solar and with 48 degrees when the cart begins, 55 degrees at the end - Burselasso wins this Sunday, using in average some 4 minutes 43 seconds per million.
Since stores such as Bursellasio and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the record of the marathon has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo from Costa of Brazil wined in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of the last Sunday, Burserlassie told the journalists that he had suffered calambres in the pantorrilla two weeks ago and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obviously that the suspension left it fresh, not oxided.
"I'm very happy," Bursella said to the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was fine."
The atleta has been subject to some critical - especially in Kenya, the Afro-East Rival of Ethiopia - for the style of sighting too much his cars, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world marathon, based on the brands as if it was a trail track, and putting the records in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticy does not decrease the size of the skills of Bergerlassie as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the loop of four Keniahians, Burselash reached half of the car at 1:02:04.
Two elite flights from Kenia, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to disappoint Burselassie after their brandpasses.
But short before three miles of the meta, Burserlassie tried a last impuls to separate Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, enhancing its best personal record for almost five minutes.
Camachi came to the third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's carriage, Irina Mikitenko, born Kazajsthan but now German citizens, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the Marathon of London at 2:24:14.
She did not participate in the Beijing Games for what was described as a lesson in the shooting, but she was recovered to win in Berlin and to establish its best personal record in almost five minutes in the third marathon.
I made a intelligent calculation car, left a fourth of the Kenian and Ethiopians to make a head and then recovering them after 18.1.2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya ended from third to 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the subject of the Great Orlando, just a few miles from the brilliant, ruining and colonal city, there is a peaceful people, where the pride and complications of African experience are very clear.
Eatonville, the first city fully inhabited by blacks in the country and the place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three crowd fields, 300 color men, 300 good feet, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of peregrination.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Year Zora!Fire in Eatonville to pay home to Mrs Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
However, in many senses, the city she described – also a tourist stage through its integration in the guide of Florida’s travels produced by the Federal Written Project of Depression Time - remains a separate place.
The city is independent and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their real ideas with the white man, which "he knows so little about us and that he doesn't know what it's going to be lost."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to begin a dialogue on the matter of race, many are still guarded against the outside.
"We are very careful about the way our history is contained", said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the whole life and member of the church of the city.
"I have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a triunfo paradox and struggle.
At the same time, a historic model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2.400 people living under a double level of national media.
It is a literary centre, but also an example of the rural culture of the Southern black - sometimes slaughtered, other joyful - born from slavery in America.
It's not strange if those living here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about the image of Eatonville really began by Zora, as here no one called Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her birth city to the world through its deep books in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed the city, only outside the street 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgot towards the history of the blacks and the human drama.
Having a grain in life as well as in literature, Mrs. Hurston led his readers to the ownership shop of the first chain of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"Found from the left to the hand," wrote, "The modern public school is with its white finisheds, his well-served gardens and game pats, care for Howard Miller, how he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the lady Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sell drinks of all kinds and anything is going to be with transitional rooms".
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston addressed Eatonville with the autonomy government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
Of course this Fodor did not.
In fact, not all the people have accepted the path.
"He described that out," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston inmortally quoted men who were sing without color songs about their beauty.
He added, " Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a living exception that has often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, is remembered that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, he did it unprecedentedly in a great Chevrolet, smoking and smoking shooting in a city that is still proud of clothing with dignity.
The majority of the residents remained fascinated, said Mr Franklin, while many were sarcastically ridicule.
"The people always enjoy seeing Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But, add, balanced in his seat in a backward shoe with view on the Sabelian Lake, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "he never remained too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and her books weren't already in the stamp.
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
While it was a literary star, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only color woman in the Barnard College in the 20 ’ s, he was entered in a anonymous tumb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he was living.
In Eatonville, there were no great Memorial ceremony, nor major public readings.
"I don't believe that his contribution to the world or heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain virgin arrived in the 80s.
Orange officers wanted to put a road of five carriages through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, two main carriages of the work community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already moved the Interstatal 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came at a moment when Eatonville was recovered from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had terms to him relatively identical isolation of the community.
In the ‘50s’, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred about the community.
"On that time, a group of white boys went through the city to take naranjas and every thing against people who were sits on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"He killed a girl once.
They slaughtered them against a car sand."
In a letter dated 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticating the strong integration of the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. the Board of Education, "speaked instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disaggregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had disabled the cohesion of Eatonville and understood the confidence of their young people.
"The black children were customated to be abroaded - I agreed about this – they were pleasing to awake the teacher for the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a organization without purposes of lunch.
This ended, added, until the teachers and students had not come from the same place.
"I wouldn't raise your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural fraction there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights, however, helped to create space for many of the most Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who were passing above the prejudices, as she did, with friendly, confidence and lines such as: "How can anyone reject the joy of my company?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tube of Ms. Hurston and began fighting to resurrecte her reputation.
Five years later, a pleasant biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in books, retroducing her into the American canons.
The road project came just at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, the old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw her as a salvador.
In 1988 the community began planning a feast for Mrs. Hurston to show what the chain could be broken with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the count has abandoned its path proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road to five ways would have been put on what you would call curvature speed, a real citizen pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd said it was simpler, "He saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the city.
Outdoor people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church of here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to revise the past.
Eatonville entered the National History Register in 1998.
A new library (the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a rebuilt and enchanted Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it may sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a small city that was found only 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 percent of people are black today.)
Forests that come in search for the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, often are still treated with caution.
To an advanced permission is necessary to make the majority of interviews, and some things - like the walls in the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - can not be photod.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a valuable and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the brilliant red, still fears that your island community can be misinterpretered.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival has been expanded, there has also been a higher birth pride level.
The young people, in particular, aim to see Eatonville as Mrs. Hurston saw all his race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, no better, and also to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, taste and mixta.
It's a sincere civic sense that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's cousin, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, who will be planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the police department, who said that it might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old gemmels of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of people, if they go to this place, must think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," said Alondra Kenon after going to the church in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at her story, it's a very nice city."
For here, in New York, everyone speaks correctly of financing
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan remain far away from the quies and the magnificent television screens in Times Square, they would not be able to find themselves in the eyes of the huracan.
They could never imagine that behind the vision fashion of the offices to beside the heads, bankers and spectacular fund managers that monopolis New York face daily with the worst "may day of the office" from the bath of 1929.
Childs for the home delivery continue to resume their metal cart for the tea through the shoes and carrying muffins bands for lunch meetings.
Latin men continue to drake between loaded apartments buildings, as human begins, with 50 extreme stamping shops junked to a jewel through their shadows. The office workers are still waiting for their food for the morning to take, and it is still impossible to cover a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon in the working days.
Employees are still expecting to make a bagel for the salesers' cart, and it is yet impossible to find a taxi between four and five nights in the weekdays.
I looked like if there was no crisis in absolute, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pesimistic predictions that there are, I decided to open a new account of shore.
Although he had calculated the time necessary for the operation to match the rest of the night in my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a collar of more or less than 20 people had already been waiting for.
And not in front of the employee's window, to remove their effective or to make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers of the whole life order their cheques households, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's large store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were before me, I was later informed by Starr, my "reliable personal bank", and they were in cola for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already removed their shoes from the smallest banks in places since they had changed them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the state island.
They had lost their money from the so-called shore associations (or a company of construction), credit unions and boxes of their birth city whose whites work only in the state of belonging, and who say to treat customers as their family.
During the last year, 15 of these banks have failed silently.
In the past days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 million, entered in the kitchen, and as neo-yorquians were heading to their homes on Week've finishing the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some $440 billion, would look for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that were standing before me, fearing another failure, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe refuge, which is the majority of the rescues in Wall Street.
Normal persons from New York have been converted into the last weeks to financing experts.
A woman in my local supermarket Chinese, speaking by phone, refers to Lehman Brothers, the failured bank, and its executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with a familiarity as if it was noted by the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, the fifty-fiveth and something I've got in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal roll of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the tender.
He said to me, after my visit to the bank, "I've got all my currency funds of the monetary market.
Commutation is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tumbs profaned at the time Austria is close to the right
Heinz-Cristian Strache, from the left side of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and the Belgian Philip Dewinter, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to submit to the organization "Chiudades against Islamization" in Amberes, June 17, January 2008.
Leave traffic signals representing the mixtures with a red line that crosss.
Police is infringement to extremists of the extreme right because they have prostituted a musulman cementary in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties of the extreme right side have made huge gains in the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tumbles were severely damaged in the Traun cementary near Linz, at some moment between Wednesday and this morning, in which the police believed that it was an organised action.
The crimers rolled Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the tumbs, but investigators think that this may have occurred by trying to hide the real reasons of the extremists that were inspired by hatred against Islamic immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident was in any way related to elections.
A local Islamic community port said they were "deeply shocked" by the propanation news, which came to the Muslim religiouss when the month Ramadan was over.
At the same time, Austria is preparing a round of introspection after the right round in the parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme right partys that were closed nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria had conducted a focused campaign in the anti-immigration age and some of their slogans were considered to be xenofobous by critics.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against the head pupils and the burkas, and also expressed its opposition to the foods considered with the Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European sister" to prevent Islam's emergency.
Both parties intend to prohibit the construction of mixes and mines, arguing that they are symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, indicate that the change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel prohibition for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinant star of skilled stones for children's sexual abuse, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges imposed Glitter a prohibition of six months after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police of Kent made the prohibition of traveling to the foreign on Thursday after the judges had produced the evidence of the previous convictions of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
A port of the Judge Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at the Court of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travellers to the foreign as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that would like to travel to the foreign, in order to be found under the registration of sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the foreign for more than three days
and it is also necessary to report to the police the date provided for by seven days before its exit.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible stopping place of Glitter at the gate.
A police porter said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country or in the foreign country.
A police porter said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country or in the foreign country.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone remaining in the UK because we are here the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
" Protecting Kent's people is the main concern of Kent's police, and we work closely in cooperation to monitor the behaviour of sexual offenders registered in the house and to reduce at least any risk that can exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after passing 27 months in a Vietnami prison for the abuse of two girls, with a age of 10 to 11 years.
When Glitter was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
He said that he was bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through pass control and finally fly to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to enter him and he flyed back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He probably came to Heathrow's terminal on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker was to the Uxbridge Court of Magistrates, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as sexual offender.
Glitter had been incarcerated in the UK for four months in 1999 for child abuse images.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, was quiet and pleased to know that they were prohibited to Glitter travel to France and Spain.
"Master's head outside scene to extract his character" Sunther Bauer_Photograph
No balls, no flights, nor shops of star.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenco, displaced from the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Unfairly saved in the intimity, in those moments you go to the public, when you find the privacy of a shooting, the depth of a shocked look or the extremity of hands, disrespected because they will not get out of scene.
The German Sunther Bauer alternate in "Flamenco-people" the theatrality of some in scene with songs, dancings and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photograph collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from various areas.
Incl. in the programmement of the Flamenca Photograph, the exhibition "reflexes the international importance of the flamenco, more than every day," explains the creator, who claims "Flamenco-people" "is possible to be any person but, when you see the photos, the observer is not the typical images of artists in the scenario.
These people "in the street" are artists who are able to transmit to a scene of passion, tristeness, joy... safeguarding the public.
To capture the personality of these artists there must not be photos from the scenario.
Take your personality and character inside.
What I interested was to create a intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the largest flamenco."
With the sacred of the "Cante des Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1.997 a long trip to turn the songers, guitarists or ballets with a plate room.
They are roots that, due to the selection of the camera and material, remember the classic photo.
The application of various structural media breaks with the classic basis of the image, trusting it in modernity, the idea that reflects how Bauer itself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It's not the action of the dance, the song or the touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, its character, which guards with its art to the public.
The search of a meeting with the essential, with the doubt that is visible in a way of feeling, being and being, and have been the constant work that these days are presented in the El Fotomata gallery.
Renounced figures of the flamenco such as Dego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebriyano, Antonio Canales, Vicente friend, among others, set this selection of almost seventeen photod artists.
The project has been converted to anology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the spectrum addresses.
The passion of Bauer's race led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Vetern sports racing" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photograph admits that "I like to turn people, to know them and to get in a moment in your life, it is a long or short moment.
I think in the photo the ray is the hardest gender.
You find or face people, personalities, that you don't know, or they're gonna leave you just a few minutes to get the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try to make reality my ideas."
This collection of the current flamenco rectangles that leads to the title "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Photomata Galería, located on Number 20 of the Mata Street, parallel to the Hercules Alamed, where it can be visited until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the news that writes is "a fear"
It is surrounded in places that are still not known and seen about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Lloa is able to get out the new project in which he works, a news that has as a protagonist to Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through Amazon.
The always favorite Nobel Prize of Literature condemned in his step by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is today "is a worst" and "all indicates that it should not write" the news.
"If I was sensitive, I wouldn't do it, but I'm gonna do it and I hope I'll ever end it," concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days have seen passing through the city of the Auditors to a hundred writers, historists and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the figures highlighted in the third edition of the word feast and complied with the prognostics.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the premium There is a Festival for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", of Dickens-, filled the depth of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Predicted by Felix Romeo, found a public delivered to him very shortly the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, repayed how he born his literary vocation, resulting in the "extrordinary aventure" of the "placing read" and "living more than what he lived"; how writes of "disciplined manner" to fulfil its "inspiration flow" with a intense documentation work, correcting and reacting; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandromas had influenced his vocation and what "image of the memory" are the basis of his history.
The Spanish newslist acknowledged that "no way" to measure and know whether the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a eyemera experience", underlined Vargas Llosa, who said that this "that has effects" and "it makes people most incomplete", so he requested writers "not leave to the competitiveness" and "to take responsibility" their vocation.
Climatology takes Pozoblanco's feast, which also remains unrejournable
The celebration of horns that closed the abone of Pozoblanco Festival was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after verifying the advertised shipers that the placing floor was not found in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, in accordance with Ferdin Bohrquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the course celebration.
The meteorological inclinations have been deceived with this feast, since the two of its three feasts have finally not been able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned tower flight.
The card was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lock.
So, only the Wednesday, there was a party.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luke who cut three ears and went out to shadows, after leaveing passes with sweet and ethical.
The same late Alejandro Talvannte left his two stages with health and a prayer, which gave more tendencies than his tore.
Yes, the worst was The Juli, who passed through the sweet of Los Llanos without punishment and glory.
In his second tour, after a flight of relief, the brochure of a large part of the public was gathered.
A control in Alava is leaked in a car with two thousand kilos of hachyz
5 less than 10 of the mature.
Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armiñón (Alava).
The agents give the two busy busy busy, and they take the shooting.
Your load, more than two tons of hachy, was not like to stop.
The agents persecuted them and stopped one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A. J., reported in a communication by the Department of Interior of the Vash Government.
The arrested person has been accused of drug trafficking and public documenting.
The incident was registered when several officials of the Arab Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in N-1, on his step through the municipal term of Armiñon.
They were disposed to stop a car for their inspection when the driver dismissed the commands, accelerated brushly and slowed the control.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle was stopped a couple of miles later in the arc, while their two occupants were shocked to run the road through a forest area.
The urzans finally reached one of them and entered into the 2.178 kilograms of haches that carried out and found after inspecting the bus, a Iveco Daily.
The next part of the vehicle was loaded from hachys shoes, so they moved to police dependances to an exhaustive and weak inspection of the drug.
The officials also confirmed that the matrix had been "double" because it was not consistent with the collection of the carton documentation, so that the arrest was also sentenced to a crime of falsification of public documentation.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the detention of the other suspect, which has been able to flee to the car, as has been said, and to determine the origin of the previous drug.
The prisoner, A.J., of 28 years of age, was transferred to police dependances to carry out relevant diligences and will take place in the next hour.
Stop the Heather Locklear act to drive under the effects of any medicine
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place serie, has been detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) to drive under the effects of any medicine.
A testimony saw doing strange manuscripts when trying to get out of his apartment in Montecito, according to the magazine, a portion from California’s road patrol.
The testimony has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear "I was shooting the accelerator down, making a lot of smiling, trying to get out of the parking car upward and behind, and after walking back, it passed several times above his sun threads."
Shortly later, the Witness, who looked at the beginning, had not recognized the actor, saw that Locklear stopped in a nearby car and went out of the vehicle.
This person warned the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police's patrol came, he found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which was blocking partly the road.
"It was disorientated", so the agents brought her to the specialized center of drugs and alcohol to carry out a test.
According to a police portion, the actor has been cooperative and the excess of alcohol was deleted from the first time, although "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of any medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect to drive under the effects of any substance that has not been specified and entered into the local prison at 19.00 hours, although it was in freedom a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona’s treatment clinic where it was recovery of anxiety episode and depression.
Calls calls for the current IA Federation to take its competence in the Silva case
The General Coordinator of IU and Deputy of Izquererda Unida, Gaspar Callazares, has assured today that it will be the regional Federation of the training that should take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sport Conception of Sevilla, France Manuel Silva, which was decreased last week after he was accused of being treated for family members.
"I'm for these things very federalist, and it's the organisation that he has to take his competences," said Challazares about the action that the party must take with which until now designed in the sevillan composer.
However, the IU leader stated that the need for "transparency" to be presented in the possible investigations on irregularities that Silva could have done: "I have always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
At the same time, he stressed that the training had "strict ethical codes for all public duties".
'Mai', the pics of Garci'
In spite of the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdoos, José Luis Garci recruits the famous resurrection of the Spanishs against the Frenchs in Sangre of May, which is the most ambitious film in its film with about 15 million euros of budget.
Thus, the cinema has tried to "illustrate the torrent of personalities and the social analysis" which has always admired in the work of the well-known newslist, he has explained today during the presentation of the kin, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would be the front of a wide list of interpreters.
May sanctuary, with a more than two and a half hours, is stern this Friday in the film rooms to become a future ministerial for Telemadrid over four hours of duration.
The great admirant of the literature of Galdos, José Luis Garci assured that he had fulfilled this wheel "un son of child," which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago launched a conmemorative census for the second centuries of May 2, which has always accepted and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The total of 15 million budgets of the Madrid Community are for Garci a "single opportunity" to environmentate with the decorations and the suitable clothing of "A A Atolond Spain that was equipped with the leadership of which to fight, because the fight for independence led to the people to a great delay with the Kingdom of Fernando VII".
But the cinema regrets not having counted with a financing such as Alatrist or Goya's fans - more than two of the Sangre of May, so he couldn't roll some plasma scenes in a guide signed near Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has cooperated in almost all his car.
Hence, the director of Return has encouraging its usual form of work, put in scene with the actors, with whom he usually tried before starting the wheel and those who do not cacing, by viewing it "humillant" and considering that "Part of the office of the director is living in a shopping theater and the cineen to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interviews that match in Sangre of May repeat in their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
The candidate to Oscar in four occasions - from which he won -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, its own Sangre of May, seven French bill tables, and finally selected, the blind tours, are not representing a young generation of Spanish cinema, "what is what to give to know", has assured.
With this film Garci doesn't expect premises.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you agree with making a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trayectory.
Isabel Bayon restore the essence of the sevilla dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillan bathroom will home to a sevillan bathroom too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, father of catalan (Florenço Tórtola Ferer) and his mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the Triana barrier, and three years old, he moved to London with his family.
It was a free and specialist dance dance dance in Eastern dance.
There was a quiet life, a pioneer from the liberation of women, such as Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
It was buddhist and vegetarian and abominated for the abolition of the corse that prevented the free women's movement.
The life of this woman that marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe of wars made Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she proposed me this character and seemed incredible."
According to the ballet, "We do not want to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of your dance suggested me the flamenco pales.
So, "the dance of the marijuana" suggested me a giant, or "the snack's dance" a few tanks.
His dance was sensitive, and my dance has said to me that my dance is also inside thisesthetic."
The mount has two exceptional collaborations: the de Miguel Poveda that will sing again in one of his shows, as he did in the "Open door"; and with the master Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanting to cooperate with those outside his school.
"Matilde does Tortola, the personality of mature.
I am happy because you have accepted acting in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The mount also contain the musical and guitarrs of Jesus Torres and Peace Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, Puga and Moi de Morón; the persecution of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfra Juárez, "what does the role of the eternal composing of this type of artists that were divine in all their extension, and they are always loving of them."
In the work, there is also a way of life of this woman that was developed in so far away places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all Europe, as it was normally in London.
"I like to remember her because I think it is of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time, and now nobody knows and makes it much less valuable in their work," says Bayon.
The spectrum will start today at 20:30 p.m. in the Vega Lope Teatro.
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where John Ramon Jimenez was married to Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities programmed by the Board of Cultural Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to remember the fifth anniversary of the conception of the Nobel Literature Prize and the falling of both.
In this way, the "Trinia Zenobia and John Ramon" ended with the reedification of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Museum of Nobel, and with the enthusiasming exhibition "Johan Ramon Jiménez: That light chop," which was inaugurated last May, and that, after traveling through the different travel provinces, it will be expected to be traveled to New York during the international Congress.
Also, the Council of Cultural Board of Andalucia has acquired a total of eight hundreds of examples of the "Journal of a Reciencated Poeta", edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue to disseminate the figure and the work of one of the most universal travel poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
" Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is of the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausence of Maliciousness", and gives the idea of the disappointment of the American Chinese, and from all America, to the influenced idea that Newman has gone.
Look that he costs to give you a Oscar.
And that's gone since 2007.
And I knew I was very sick.
That's how it's been a mass for everyone.
"Atimely what a feeling is beyond any expression, and I have lost a great friend," sweared Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to make the smile or exager.
There was a father of China and Patricia in a specially dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-stimate by the grounds, looking for desperate reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without attribute to the men and very little beings to admire you to stay, it does not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was incarned for everyone a ideal almost platonic of beauty and reality.
He was formal enemies from Richard Nixon and defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first gentleman died by overdoses to his case and organic food mark.
A whole gift to a country to which it has been costing to overcome a suicide food culture.
The expansive wave of the admiration bar would Hollywood without attaining nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English English Daniel Craig, found that he didn't died a man but one era.
Another English director Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was no longer than the sum of his car.
The bad boy coming from Australia, Russell Crowe, was to call Newman his most inspiration.
"We have left the very high list to everyone," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping up the need for possibility and having a serious and distant private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once, but then I was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, which was faithful when he certainly overwhelmed the opportunity to not be it.
"But for what I'm going to eat a hamburger out of house, if I'm inside, I was smiling himself.
In the heavens it was the pride that his daughters in the earth correspond to their fans, something that is not so common in America.
"For all the major roles he interpreted, no one was so proud that of an devoted husband, loveing father, solituous grandfather and dedicated philantropus," they say.
The imperfect carriage of a Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they celebrate in Madrid some olimpied and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the dinner car, I say no!
The perfect car was calling it, and my judgment has been the worst career in which I was.
A columbia of disproportionates that, since then, if they have taken into account as a assessment and I would examine, it would be a very clear suspension.
But we're going by parts and from the beginning.
The insupports start with the dorsal collection, which makes you have to go before.
What doesn't seem bad to me, but if you're already going to give it everything (including the chip to avoid collars in the car).
Well, no.
Here they did you only go to collect the dorsal (only unproposed, go only to that) and (for the relevant collar), shred!, there was only the 'S' s for the shoes (speaking, because I need a XL ball)
In what world we live?
Or have they decided to buy only smaller shops with less sweets and cheapest shoes for the crisis?
Well, things like these are a mine compared to the day of the car.
Besides having to go very early to collect the chip, the collar when reaching is of 15 minutes and, moreover, the mochila must be left.
More than 35 minutes longed the waiting, something incomprehensible for a car where more than 11.000 people are expected.
Then, as he was to wait, he started the cart, and we had not left the mochila, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
Furthermore, the rain led over 40 minutes to wait, which joined with popular rebellion counts and attacked the box.
I think some 500 people certainly will have pulmony tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip that told me that, I imagine, it didn't mark me out correctly.
Since then, if you asked me for the perfect car, this wouldn't enter into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream with a well prepared olympic city.
Microsoft Search Receptor (virtual)
At the conference of Emergence Technology of Microsoft MIT has shown a progress of a new system of human image recognition and interaction, a species of Artistic Intelligence without very intellectuality but can perform some basic tasks, such as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company) by listening to what is listening to the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remembering what they're taking place - and listening and understanding the key words of their conversations.
To group presents according to the discussion groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not a company employer.
She asked if she's there to visit someone and tell him that he'll be waiting for him.
Everything's blue screen.
Incredible.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has best things in which it is focused, for example in the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week has been very talking about a strategic change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and you will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers will come in with the impossibility instead of commercial loads, they would be five times faster - man, Steve, will be for less.
Everything finding that Microsoft, after version, has added functions and "extra" to Windows.
The roll change is grateful.
Microsfot has the right, the operational system will lose importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many have noted with awareness that a browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the necessary board to understand Hardware and software.
Fill the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell you something to your dream.
It's true.
It will never disappear but there is no need to think about the "death" of the operational system, not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are always less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is launched only to execute Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we pass more time to navigate than in the window environment.
For what are half of the applications coming in the system?
It's less than it.
And Windows 7 must be less, very less, than Vista.
Weight less weight, less reloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interesting to integrate your online services and to be an alternative to Google.
They need it unexpectedly, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post took it in one of the relaxing rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the refreshing machine, a card requests you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the network.
Last week, in fact, a delay was also confirmed in the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be reached at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
In Microsoft you will certainly search for the joint Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass facture.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso led her into the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lighted one in 'Director of Blood' of Edward Zwick, the same as Al Padrino in "El Padrino" of Francis Ford Coppola, as part of the uniform of the muscle gay paroquia.
And if we're putting a list of star appearances, we can get back to the image of that shooting shooting shock that leaned weight in a ambulant circle.
In fact, it is not more than the typical sweet men's inside in wood, ceñed and without food.
The 'tank', which calls the speaking angles, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels dispunks on all others.
First, for his rebuilding name - although familyly you know it as 'Marcel' - you have to see with the sport because he receives his name, according to the legendary, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loves the songer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' emphasizes on the others by its excellent cocktail, by its unix court, by its distinctive shooting and by the small Belgian flag (approximately recognisable) that the most emblematical shoes models take as details in the hair.
And care, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also include college boxers, back boxers, boxers of cafes, ball pants, marine chains, babys, mini shorts...
You're thinking for the comfort to underwear.
Although it's a regret to leave them as internal clothes.
They're too nice.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry."
His great appearance with his sister has not prevented you to develop his own personality.
Monique Cruz is a menu but full of vitality.
Cruz’s sisters currently take very seriously their new activity in mode.
For Monica, they're much more than some guapas and famous girls that give their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the signing Mango makes in his new seat, in addition to the presentation of the most important mode premiums than the Spanish house sponsorized.
Calm and timid, win in short distances.
Tell us you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we thought my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new summer winter in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What is based on your new collection for Mango in this fourth time working for Spanish house?
My sister as well as me love the cine of the 50s and 60s; we take many references from there.
Then I like to lose me for a city and observe women as they are clothes, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it very much.
Bailarin, actor and designer, you're a very polyfactic woman, right?
I think yes, but at the end, everything is one and there are many common lazos.
I liked my clothes from little; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to hurry in the armies of my tea and to see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better to go to the attraction park.
Then, of dance, I always tried to care how I was clothing.
You know that dancings love us to make our styles for classs and tests, to look at the shore and feel good.
And in the role of the actor when you give the closure to you is when you really find the person.
Then, everything will be bound, that is, with very respect for designers and professionality.
You haven't fulfilled the 30s, have you got a crisis?
Let's move out.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
Find that the woman is done, she has experience and sweet life with less errors.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I did the things I wanted from little and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think you're mother or not?
Since then, I know that I'm going to be a mother because I'm asking the body and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As regards the candidate, I'm not worried about it.
What I'll do is to give him a lot of happiness to my son and to educe it with a lot of love.
As regards the cine, you're holding several stars that you're rounded last year.
That's, and I've already won't see the light.
I, that I'm a woman coming from the theatre, I'm very inquired and worried, I want everything for already and clear, I can't be.
I wish they are "The last hour" and "Search for the Tube of Christ."
Looking like them...
A few days ago, you've got a pair with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm able to make it model.
Just calling me Naomi Campbell, whom I had known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a well-better disfile for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the cloth that we showed - I was out of two pieces of our collection to Mango - was sought to restore money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that kind of heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not certain.
In addition, I remain with that so good part in which she is involved.
She asked me to dismiss for a so nice cause, but if it comes to ask me to do the pino, too.
For the benefit of women of the third world, what you need to do isn't.
Reciprocal alcoholic drivers should install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver to have three administrative sanctions by alcoholic sanctions, to install on its vehicle a system that prevents the steel vehicle, or if not.
The initiative was already announced in June last month and now appears in the annual memory of the State General Inspector, according to which it is a pilot project that will be a period of one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so it will also receive a currency of fresh reducation.
In the experience, as well as the Vial Segurida Inspection General, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Mobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the complained automobilists more than once by driving workers return to the car.
Alcolock would prevent it because it is a system connected to the vehicle which measures the alcohol rate in the air espirated and prevents the car to start the car if the driver isn't soup; or when a alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted.
Its cost is above EUR 1.000 and would be paid on account of the sanitation.
In this regard, a study carried out in the EU in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced up to 65 per cent of the offences during the first installation year.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save life to 115 people each year.
The measure is referred to administrative sanctions for two reasons: address these behaviors before they are in criminal crimes.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done in a ordinary way, and, however, the reform necessary for criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is still not available in the Spanish market in no commercial modality, although in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles it has already been experimentally installed.
Once tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote to a PSOE initiative in which this system is proposed to be installed in school bus, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., the time in the programme was at the Presidential Hagar of the Benito Juárez de Mexico DF aircraft in which the Spanish Air Force travelled the Princes of Asturia.
The sun was out, but his rays were still forced to use the hand in a visa way to see the real couple down from the flight.
At the footsteps, the Spanish embassy and other authorities.
Hours had previously asked for the street, the taxist, if I knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to formalize an official travel.
Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time... she's out of here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But Mexico’s press knows who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the travel.
Many are expecting in the hamgar of the red helmet and a military fleet formed by 27 marine soldiers that interpretate the salvation of honors.
The prince appears to be sounding, clothes of sea blue, and she, Princess, meleaned the wind, very sweet, did not use its usual 'peep-to', maybe they had informed him that in the DF threatened to torment.
Regular a sound and a shock stops the photographs before passing into the room where the official committee is expected.
At the gate of the hotel where they stay, one of the four large cities, waits for you for a medieval newspaper of Mexico TV.
The best offered prize of mode
Maybe there is no place in the world the most suitable to present a modest premium, which Paris and may have no more exquisite and good designer than Valentino.
Mango has finished to present the second edition of El Botão-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international projection of the new talents of the mode.
It is equipped with a cost of EUR 300,000.
Last night Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the escape of Mango, in the 54th housesmann boulevard of Paris and almost crying about the emotion.
Indeed, it is the second largest shop of the signing in Europe and has been inaugurated by 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
Such events, joined with the desire to thank you to the Valentino designer who presided the jury of the jury of the judge, did we end in a dinner of luxury in the Operor of Paris.
With the nearest Chagals nearby, the Presidential Gala table prepared by Mango, it was still more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart of punishment and trial heart, by the recent failure of his brother, was put a clothing from the House and one of the right sides of ELAH, which cut the breathing, and from his son Luis' arm, a canon of almost two meters of length - accompanied to Valentino in the presidency of his homeday dinner.
Andik, ladies and gentleman of Mango, did the honour and it's so sweet that he ended near the Rotchil bar, without everybody, because both were given to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who accompanied the shop with snakes and shops - and for the dinner, turned into a nigger sexy sweet clothes, was excited when in the night passement, together with Goya Toledo, taught us the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, took up one of the bars and made an 'grander sweet' sweet.
Ines Sastre did not stay in the pass of the palace's dependances, but first he taught us in the mobile phones of his son.
The next morning we could enjoy the view of Olivier Martínez’s presence - another canon that moves in moto - and by John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with its sambaans, its toilets and requested before, that there were no looks in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000, but 1000 more a way to forget the cotidian caotic and frenetic life.
And if it was little, all are gathered in a book that will bring the relax to the book books on September 30th.
The depertoire is almost punishing when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is even worse to imagine in the shocked ritme that implies the current life.
The office is called tension and the computer's sword pain.
The stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there is no one or two methods to fight daily extension and disconnecting problems with the work world.
No, the number goes to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Under yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott meets on the pages of a book a 'menu' of opportunities adapted to the enjoyment and minutes of each one.
The anti-esthetic work is called '1001 ways to relaxe' and its calm will come to the bookbooks of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If a person considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' is unlike such faith.
Furthermore, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or income 100% natural that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not run for your wines to restore the body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Sleeping talks
Some kids talk for the night.
I am not referring to those who are very slowing is shocked by telling us something happened in the previous day, but to the children who speak to be sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best, you have a shock, but it is not really important.
It's a good change of the dream that is called somniloquius.
It's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you have told you she talked about the night.
This phenomenon can appear in a very spontaneous way (one time in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodic (all days, once a week, once in monthS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
Often are related to other dream changes, such as the pains, night terrors, the enuresis of night (slaughtered) or the sonambulism, but it does not have to be so.
As we have previously mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fiber tables, stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In all ways it is a little studyed phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be speaking in a calm voice tone, sweet words, a sleeve or all the other (graps, llantes, long speechs...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would agree to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to verify whether there is a question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives it out in this way.
We have said that it is a good change, therefore he does not have treatment, except that it will be associated with another dream change that can be treated (e.g., if it is associated with a dream apnea or a stress table).
What can be done is taking into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
To try not to smell the kid before I'm going to sleep.
So search for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are feared or a little violent.
With extremely nervous children and that it costs much relaxing, you can use relaxing techniques to help them get a certain internal calm.
This will like the child to have a more quiet dream.
Once the dreams appear to try to keep calm.
Reconciliation that they are inoffensive for the child and that on the next day will not remember anything happened.
Useful Councils
You don't decepte it.
It is inutile, because he is not conscious, and you will break the dream to him.
While you're talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
I realize that if you are shown very anxious during several episodes, you would agree to consult or find out what is what generates such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (who isn't the most common one), do not want to make a questionnaire to save you information.
You won't get nothing, because when you're sleeping, you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Moreover, you will hear what you say, but you do not know what you are dreaming to say so, with which much care about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you know.
You never give him the child that you could ask for the night to know his secrets.
Don't even ridiculous.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that duration only a few minutes.
They're finished!
The fútbol club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of the victory in his field after a long time of missing.
Without a good game, the team created many times of gol and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The ritm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors were difficult to express themselves.
After a first trial of the Captain Kauffmann who shooted the squad with a shooter of fars, Illhaeusern cuasi would take the "poder" and on the Funterfick round, then with Hirn up, Romein with the foot point or Debold came to prevent the defense of shamemary.
On the other hand, we did not stop passing the central campsite and only left Riahi in a attack position.
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Temporale for shamemary, and immediately after the opening of the Marker for the Illuusians with the Marais Go, well located to collect the ballon rejected in a first attempt of Debold (53 ').
But the Illiousiens don't know a long time their happiness and will be obliged to return back in the store a twenty-minute later and then leave his team partners in numerical minority.
But there will not be a problem for the 11 illusionians who returned a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a significant fat, the ballon passed very close to the cross-border field.
Sarkozy finds funny fishermen
Before moving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a wheel through Britain.
In view of the protest of resistance from fishermen who strongly distressed the last Monday the entries of several bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on March last morning at the port of Guilvinec, in Finnish, to find there its representatives.
They promised to join it " with a constructive spirit " and expected that " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit corresponds to the general " crisis committee " established by bretton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in the gas prices, which marks a record to reach EUR 1.14 per litro.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's portal, the President will " discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help its companies to be competitive and to save the conditions of marine jobs and rewards " .
Fishermen expect Nicolas Sarkozy to firmly feet.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to facilitate the movement in Morbian and Calvados, which have occurred soon from nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's sport port has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
" A filtering bar" has been placed in the Quiberon Peninsula.
The mariners have already shown their determination by smiling the alba, neumtic and wood palettes before the Brest ports' fuel deposits, and Lorient, while manifestations were placed in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as in the Sable d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boats remained at the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Crossic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped late the blocking of the important dongues total refinance.
Bologne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until the meeting of this Monday, which will take place in the Ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " Crisis Committee " should consider the march in the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting provided for in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The shelter will continue " because " fishermen did not abandon " and " they did not want to move to Paris ", for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas oil rates, currently pay about 50 cents per litro, but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil with a price below EUR 0.30 per litro.

About two Republicns of each three rejected their plan.
"This is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan, " said Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN.
"This shows how the market was counting with this plan ", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within a few days comes "the late."

Obama, winner during the first television bathroom
At the first debate of the Thursday between both candidates in the White House, there was another one to know who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the general quarters of Republic and Democratic campaigns announced their own victory in this television duty that has been followed by a third of the American family.
The political analist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, was not "blunt" to allow him to slow up in the trials to five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose analysis of the public view published last Saturday, gives five advantages for Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent for McCain), considers that it is the democratic who had been good.
Among the undecisive electors, which are those who are accounting, Obama grew over to 39 per cent of the surveys, while 25 per cent of them granted the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his benefit on Thursday with the expected benefit of his member of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to subsist her.
It's good instincts ", even though Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventh-general McCain proved that his insufficient experience in the field of external policy was noted, stressing the "ingecurity" of his adversary about these issues that were in the heart of this first care.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " several times accused.
" I do not think that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be the President, " she also sured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements.
Obama highlighted that it represented the future.
Without disconsciousness, it was shown concise and necessary.
He highlighted its ability to take the good decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it ", replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that rejected him to the Republic because he had not considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
"In the twenty-five minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama declared yesterday, before 200,000 people had been gathered for a election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
It did not say the words "media" or "workers". "The financial derogation clearly favours Obama, which is considered by the United States as the most capable person to save the economy that is on the borde of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive episode ", estimated, yesterday, the influenced and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared the " good economic instincts" of Obama with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that, despite the reduction of taxes of 95 per cent of the United States, despite Wall Street overseas, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence in the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear centers from here to 2030.
Actually, both candidates had a balance of $7,7 billion in the financial saving plan of $4,7 billion ($4,7 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Youths and opposites showed the last Sunday at the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of the legislatives in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarus meetings were held on Sunday after the end of the election centres in the Minnesota central place to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, he has to dimit ".
Some recognize that they have not voted: "For what, because they will do what they want with my vote, " says a young man.
They do not believe that the system that I had made good care for foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the congelation of certain assets, may be highlighted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We have been placed to the electoral committees and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," said Youri Potemkine, the porter of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heerogeneous reruption of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the movement for Europe, because the importance of whom the votes account, and in our home is the executive power.
If some of the opposition Members come into the Parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry to Parliament may mean TV appearances, meetings in regions and law proposals. "
The opposition should therefore be in the political game because " must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, who has many debts in the front of Russia, is in a crisis, and if we don't reform, we are risking to make Russia's protector.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, following the election process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stressed that the participation figures seem to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (26 % of the electors in Minsk) promoted manipulations.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the election centres.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to the Parliament, which will be better to the power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the place of October.
In the television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Committee are welcomed for their success.
The interview - Sangre returns to be safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and his President, Francine Decary, had a reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec returned to be one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he recognised the public's confidence that was seriously dissolved by the polluted blood scandale in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been polluted by human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the discount of the public, the Government of Canada made a public survey in February 1994, chaired by the Judge Horacio Krever, which intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations so that such disaster would not be reproduced.
While Judge Krever late in presenting his relationship, some provinces then created a committee that aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee complied with this mission.
As a result of the Gelineau and Krever reports, two providers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec for providing Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territorys.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, almost 38 per cent of the people had yet confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Decary.
The situation was degrading.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years they followed, we have recovered the public's confidence ", said to be proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Kidney population had the next trust in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, recalled that " confidence is something extremely fragile " .
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precaution principle.
At that time, we were in Europe at the born of many cases of the human variant of the local vacuum disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account of Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transferred through blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, which, when we do not know it, and when a serious disease can enhance it, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we set out out of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we rejected the blood of people who had remained more than one month in the UK since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proved out of any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of precaution which was applied had a sense. "
In 1999 there was a more sensitive technique of HIV detection in the market: the tests of nucleus acid that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against the virus, where the tests were based until now.
Nucleated acid tests allowed to accumulate the period between the time the person has been infected and the moment when the first virus can be detected in the blood for our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period in a less than one week.
We decrease so substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing and cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed significantly to reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, a person every 12 million runs the risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood.
"This means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
Thus, as Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood products, it will pass over 24 years prior to an HIV transmission case for a blood product.
I think that today can be receiving or prescribed a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," said Hema-Québec head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products security.
You never know what pathogens could emerge in the system.
Last year on the island of the Reunion the Chikungunya virus, which, for example, is transmitted by an insect in blood.
It must be constantly monitored ", follows Dr. Decary before emphasising that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" The needs are increased because the population is old.
Since more aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need a injection of red glucose or plates.
The age of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that react in mean term only 3 per cent of Quebequees admissible to blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the admissibility criteria, however, may give blood every 56 days, or may be six times a year.
In the meantime, 14 per cent of the people proposing their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where Malaria is reign, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3 per cent, we managed to maintain an inventary that covers the needs of hospitals.
Penuria is very rare.
But it must be renewed to the members of this donor network as they are older and can't give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since the current life is very disappointed, we find rarly the time to pass an hour to give his blood ", Francine Decary is affected.
With a annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including oxes, cardiac valves, eye globals and skins that are almost exclusively used for the large skins.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also managed the only public blood bank in the Umbilical coron in Quebec.
Ancient humble coron is considered as biomedic waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leucemia.
"We've been celebrated a few weeks ago, in the bank of our millennium blood sample, and it's expected to get out of more than thousands of them per year.
We would have to begin to propose it for inherents at the beginning of the next year ", he needs to Dr. Decary that describes this curon blood plan as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed of not enjoying this " because Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and costful programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The impact on semi-final
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-final of the eliminatory series of the USL first division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 in summary) at the coast of the Sounders of Seattle, last night, during the second and decisive parti of the final room series, at the Sapulto Stadium.
The center camper Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive gol at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without gol anywhere, the central campsite David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one who disappointed Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first party of the series of ida and turning games, the Impact had suffered a derogation by 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver whitecaps in semi-final.
Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game on Saturday night in the Minnesota, but the Whitecaps accompanied the semi-finals by 5-4.
The Impact should be addressed to Whitecaps on Wednesday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev's victory goal
The three number one of the Canadians is ready to operate the time.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has encouraged the attack in a winning by 3-2 of Canada to the free barriers against the Florida Panthers last night in the Central Bell.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a gol, Plekanec accumuled two aids, and Kovalev took a step in this winning, the Tricolor room in six preparatory partitions.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only gol.
"I'm still not ready, before the Russians.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the maximum at first time, announced Guido Carbonneau.
But I think it got the end of the party.
There was a nice ovation. "
Check is occupied from North
The First Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu (left), tried to be elected during the partial election of today.
Refusing the limits of our last large border of the north ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest had presented with visibility to remain in the large lines, in the terms of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party, in Lévis yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were designed.
They disfilated, in three major screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric embars, mining exploitation, from Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as during the election period.
The first minister believes that elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his time was very full.
The " North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" which the first minister intends to have for Quebec, the of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, a partnership between Canada and Europe and harmonity with Ontario.
As often mentioned in the discours of the first minister recently, the opening of the northern territory to the 49th paralel has never been subject to a presentation.
The first minister was, however, limited to explain why North was " a joy to the great potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts or priority in future projects.
What could most likely be developed is: hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, which is covered by the growth of emergency countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " niquel, cinc, copper, platino, gold, plata, ice, titanium, and also diamond ", according to the list of Mr. Charest.
This " territories two times large as France ", " is our home, is in Quebec.
It's not only our home, but it's in us ", he insisted, as to show that I requested a national founder.
Quebec was built very thanks to his relationship with the North, underlined: the ride to the gold in Abitibi, the Quebequesa engineering, the Bahia James.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having made a theatrical break to contemplate the pretty map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec Territories, includes a part of the Labrator who always re-evited, required the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which it is not agreed for a long time and, when the time is presented, I reiterate that position from the government. "
Furthermore, " with climate changes, we need to recall our vision of the North, " he declared about the Northwest Pass, which will be open every year because of the functioning of the ices.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister considers that occupation of the territory is a duty.
And the people of the territory, the First United Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Quebec Government would be very attention to them and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different partys, Peter Corbeil and Michel Léturneau (anafter deputy of the Quebecues party in Hungary), already began consultations near a tremendous communities.
An interminist committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has been an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting on which " will be given a common vision " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment " , promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuously with the first liberal ministers before him.
" As the previous liberalians, we thought another way to transform the challenges in new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurrent themes at the end of the week, which started Thursday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of John Leage's arrival to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebuild the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro Quebec, in Leage that made the peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Boursa that made the Bahia James our party knows to force the future," said John Charest.
In the press conference, he called another reference, that conservator, the John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric emballage project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned by 2012.
"This remains among us, but I expect to be there," he trusted his warriors, urging applauses.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that there would not be elections in 2008 and without doubt in 2009, did not delay the possibility of a vote on this autonomy, which allows it to be enforced by the law.
It stressed that his time is not yet full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council on the end of the week, submitted to the Liberal Chief a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party, in particular, calls for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished to name Quebec members of the Council of the Radio Distribution and Canadian Telecommunications and have a veto rights on decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The chief of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, emphasized the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government had started in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, coming to the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If it had done, "we had progress today," Mrs. Marois commented on the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that has been made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec was able to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the Government.
"But what you want is that this is not just a spectacle " , commented leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, which returns from holidays today.
Letters - A Deshoned country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper office, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "vergottenance" for Canada.
Thus dishonoring this woman who brought an instant fight for justice and worth all our admiration, what he says about the relationships of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all Western countries involved, who has not repatriated their nationally closed in the concentration field of Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young boy when the facts that his crimes occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and lets live in inhuman conditions a soldier child.
The only one that shoots with false justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Association of Canadian lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government who closes the eyes of torture: it is unlikely that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after many years of explanation.
We still do not realize that, but we are at this time instead of an incredibly erosion of our rights, freedom and democracy, that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not mean.
It has already arrived the time where no more morality is: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprisoned to a Canadian citizen as he wants the government head until now of minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that pleads the Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government rejected what the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews' ridicule is caused by this renumber and for nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian Mine Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logical, Barrick Gold states that the largest aury company in the world tried to defeat a process of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house to cause a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and imparcial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by difamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is fully hidden by Mr Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would harm anyone to support its opposite position?
The result of the pledge has little importance, authors and editors of the Noir Canada book should pay considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fighting, with very unbalanced weapons, against a army of lawyers supported by the balls almost without the mine.
Tactics, in these unigual struggles, often consists of ruining the demanders in order to introduce a friendly arrangement that will love the opposition, and to live anybody to re-examinate the issue.
If Barrick Gold really loved a public debate, it is in front of the public view that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
On the contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally made by the change of ideas and not to shoot attacks.
It was because the minera opened its books, its expeditors and established a real debate, through journals, media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public view and rejects the requests and letters for support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how to ask a "public" debate by depreciation of the opinions of this?
According to the Vice-President, this word seems only to be appointed to the very payed lawyers and not to all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, delegators have also the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and the editors of Noir Canada do it especially because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge it, but as a basis for civilized changes of arguments, and not in the context of what many people understand as a murdering persecution (for example, the " public debate ", Barrick Gold has just set up a request for the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them to no longer use this word).
In addition to the surreal speech by Mr. Garver, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack against the freedom of university and truth, essential for all democratic society.
He rejects the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that disappoint the rich enterprises of this world in a country such as Canada, in spite of many persecutions, who can do this?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, it could be possible to follow the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
He has a right to answer.
The university world, which we belong, knows for a long time to administer debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The unforeseen persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what you want, you do not want to do a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put devices that limit this kind of abuse persecution.
Wall Street Reservation Operation - Democrats and Republicans are agreed
Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, both republic and democratic, finally reached an agreement on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the United States $7,7 billion, which intends to spend the financial crisis that takes to Wall Street for months has still been confirmed by the two Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides a better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, the new provisions to contain the number of employed houses in the lack of payment, as well as a right to control of payments paid to the leaders of supported enterprises.
The American Secretariat of the Teacher, Henry Paulson, President of the Representative Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republic of the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after the midday night, at the end of a negotiation martyr that had been held two days.
" We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets, " stated the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to cover the economy and the United States before the current crisis in Wall Street", explained the Democracy.
"It's the fundamental point: if we do not do this, traumaism, caos and distress on the daily life of the United States will be great, " said the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been very rapidly concluded in the past hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of investors.
The last time they had been fixed was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have been late in the negotiations, were more favourable for the agreement, without forgetting expressing their impairment to be obliged to reach this extremeness.
Senator Barack Obama was granted some provisions to achieve the agreement, especially what would allow the owners to keep their home and the wage of the leaders of the State surviving enterprises.
" When the contributors are requested to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be happy.
But these measures are necessary ", commented on the American television.
His Republican adverse, John McCain, was interviewed in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote it."
"The important points I read [monster] that is something that we'll have to divide and with which we'll be able to go forward.
He said that the option to not do anything is not acceptable " .
The plan of 700 billion intends to purchase the money of the contributors of doubts, risk assets and inconvenible assets of the American financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis caused by the establishment of an immobiliary bubble that first led to the slaughter of hypotecary risk credits before being extended to other common forms of credit titles (PCAA) and to cause liquidity frozen and dismissed banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elections that had made changed the first agreement project last week.
We believe we have been out of the shock since the democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, better than purchased.
In order to strike up the stands for all the world in the Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new rates that would like to help him to restore money.
The new plan provides the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 million more can be added if the President seems to be necessary.
The payment of the other 350 billion would be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
Instead of their aid, Washington will get participations in supported enterprises that will be divided in the case of winning and which can be sell again when the torture is passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures in relation to housing with immobiliary loans under this plan, as well as to establish reimbursement limits and metall compensations paid to the leaders of the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it subject to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives since today and to the Senate on Thursday.
Despite all your efforts, it is still not sure that your plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest against this project, both from the Republicns and the Democrats last night.
The Republic of Scott Garrett, a member of the commission of Finance of the Camera, declared its electors that " with any evidence Washington would not understand " .
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But what is not the benefit of the contributions. "
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in the Congress, presents otherwise the problems, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Fourty teachers in the economy, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say: We asked the Congress not to press and carefully review the way to take", said the Congress last night.
At the same time, in Europe, we had the test of the world's naturality of crisis again.
After a urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French BNP Paris bank had refused to purchase its competitor in slaughter since $2.9 million had lost (2.9 million) during the crisis of the inmobilial risk loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85.000 people and is part of the twenty larger European banks and the ten larger insurers.
"This is not lost money, he declared the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss yesterday.
Instead, we have the right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the shrineers and the families appreciate now that the times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British Government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be charged for all the loans in the Bradford and Bringley Bank and for more than 41 billion euros (75.5 million dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander told to know yesterday that it was the one who would buy the banks and bank accounts from the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented their triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely dream had been released from his narcistic side?
Yeah and no.
His power, his sensitivity and a talent that was clearly also will have been away from the record of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But that's a big backward runner!
Paul Newman died on Wednesday, 83 years, because of a pulmonary cancer in his Connecticut cut, remains one of the last icons of the US cinema in fast years.
It is less phenomenonal than Brando, who looked much and was considered for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and stall of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from the German Jewish father and the mother of Hungary origin.
From these European roots will born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without disappointed ego, the last quality mark.
Because in it, a whole country was designed to be a loving country of self-doing man, the fighter of the Pacific war, blessed in battle, which at the beginning of the 50s, studied the dramatic art in Yale, then frequently the Actor's Studio of New York before triumphing in the theater, in the television and early in the cinema.
This man who struggled by civil rights was also the car driver who was classified in the second position at Le Mans 24 hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although the member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
They also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and compromised star, allergic to the scandals of the spectacle that we don't know very well.
It's a honored man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman tried the cinefils to this weekend, while their large roles were taken on the black screen of memorys.
More than a mid - century of the seventh American art in perpetual change is difficult through it.
Many remembrances come back to memory like the cow-boy with a loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensible wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adjusted zinc teater of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), we call his sensible Mr. Bridge, distressed by a marriage that did not comply with all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed to the film history.
This boxector Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Only Hate Marked), Robert Wise, was a role to James Dean, repeated after his death, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic eating in the solar film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar the best film in 1973.
Awesome biller player in the magnificent film The Hustler of Robert Ross (1961), will repeat the personality in The Color of Money de Martin Scorsese, who valued him in 1987 his only Oscar between nine names.
This face that changed with the years, he was him.
He wasn't.
The times change during their career.
Young people know him especially thanks to the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hockey team on ice little ortodox.
His fans returned to see him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the last role of the Irish mafia mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rise was rich.
On the contrary to several cinema legends that left the car, Newman remained much in the world of the cinema, claiming Hollywood, gold, speed and conceptions.
The French cinema Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the sub-playing " and that he judges his too supported benefits.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman when the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, it often interpreted the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, horns or disperses, whose races reflected the rebellion.
As a executive, Newman revealed the sides of his real public sensitivity not very well known.
His movie Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (in the news of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a woman's melancoly root.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdosis gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, the work of powder and tristeness.
"By the numerous homenings that were discovered last night for Newman, his great friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (the worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important races of the falling actor.
On the other side of his legend's career, there is also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent China, a contestant against Hollywood's excess.
We have seen a lot of his face dominating on the wine salt bottles, salts, gallets and other foods, judgeing this method as a bad method, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Foundation for Child in difficulty.
Newman, better than satisfying his myth, it will have been compromised until the end.
He left them to his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Where and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the care of a American artist so luxury and generous.
A model citizen is summarised.
What were they produced in the Succio & amp; Co.?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal process will be initiated against Yanos Zuppo and its compliments.
Political and its commitments are accused of making significant damage frauds, in a business way, continuously and organized way beyond other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Fiscalia, the funds obtained in public competitions have been used in their own purposes, justifying in many cases the compliance of tasks with false facture.
The public funds and the funds - in its totality about 65 million HUF - were partly held in the tight of the Ball-Organization Fiatal Organization and in part in the board of individuals.
The method, which was given to know by researchers also, was to justify the cover of the funds obtained in public competitions with false facture behind which they had not actually implemented, the different associations never complyed with their assigned obligations.
According to the accused, most factures were false.
To this end, households were obtained in the market in the district of Józsefvas, and circular seals were made in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, on behalf of which company the false facture had to be carried out, between others in that round by the Supreme Baltic Region Yanos Zuppo sent to Istvaan Lados.
This last condemned that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested a facture for its consumption, and they were modelled to make the facture that were presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Deportation, the Ministry of Social and Labour, as well as the Capital Appeal.
These factures were signed mostly by Istvan Lados and its compliance András śri, who, according to our information, had better written the reports necessary to obtain public grants.
During one of his "study shoes" Lados elected a brain.
According to two factures issued by Zuкус and its compliments in 2003, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the center manager, many people do not fall at the same time.
Similarly, the facture issued in the summer 2002 for the Jobb Jövṣṭért Foundation - later called Egyuttt to Harmadik Evezredert - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel of Badacsonytomme was just three rooms and more than ten people couldn't stay there in one night, however, in the facture, there were hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed to the Gastronomic Centre Pigal Kft. Because in the holding of books of the same – according to the information provided to the Fiscalia - had no document named Jobb Jövæért and Hopaá.
Gyśz Farkas, the manager of that company, informed you to hvg.hu that when it was quoted by the fiscality and showed the factures, he knew that it was false documents.
"In the sell the name of our company and the NIF appeared in an incorrect place."
He acknowledged: In addition to formal problems, it was not agreed that, according to the facture, hundreds of people were accommodated, since they had only once rooms in which there were no way many people.
In addition, the facture also included food, while the restaurant hasn't worked long ago.
Factory manufacturers did not have reported that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organized exclusively travels to the outside, so that in the effective payment fact, they were fully indicated as a service for a travel within Hungary, which did not match the practice of delivery of factures from the Agency.
Furthermore, as was known during the investigation, the VAT also included in the document, although travellers outside the European Union were exempted from taxes.
Among other things, the measure of the VAT was valid in the four documents sent by the Hotel Revfullöp Kft. for the foundation of Jobb Jövśért, since the company services are not loaded with 25, but only 15 percent of VAT, and the hotel employees only extended factures made to machine but the facture was manual.
In addition, the "expeditors" also made other errors, such as in the case of a company in which they put into the facture as the activity carried out by road transport that was known during the fiscal investigations - not performed the company founded as investment advisor.
Similarly by formal differences - inadequate format of the facture, it is false that the factures sent to Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
Like in Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camping of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have sent these factures.
The falsificators also noted that when the Fiatal Városért Egyzület group eat there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyrigajhaza was in the liquidation process, so the responsibilities of the liquidation process - according to our information - had not been sent to this document.
They were conscious of the factures
Another group of false facture manufacturers is composed of those conscious that they should be able to issue physical factures.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvay Foundation, on request of Balldonal Fiatal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has issued a facture for some four million HUF named the Egyuttt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert.
Collab Kft's manager. - According to the accused, he convinced one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue physical facture.
Similarly, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, provided factures for a closed value of five million HUF to the foundation of Jobb Jövṣṭért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörôsfenyś Egyesület Association , without real economic activity behind.
There was no capital movement, since then they canceled the factures prepared but forgot to make it available in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false facture manufacturers include those who have any link to accused persons.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the demandant of the Ukrainian leader of Delta Trio SL with a fixed seat in Budapest, which was occupied with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
This company has issued numerous factures for a nearly 18 million HUF value in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the research data, these factures were purchased by the Chiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which is under liquidation process since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Roman who Iván Kubatov should have issued also the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation which sent on behalf of the facture company for Atlasz, Hopaah and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvny covering its own amount.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were found by Roman albanians on express request by Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because of the accused to which they did not receive work.
But he benefited from these companies, since at the request of his compliance, the lawyer Z Solt Szente, who prepared the register documents of the company, spent factures on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuppo: for Atlasz and Y-Generacio.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade accompanied 15 factures to different entities by a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Fiscalia considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10 per cent of the facture.
This man also used the society in the Szi-Beri command to issue physical factures used in the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Generatio and Sövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a complaint in January 2006 to Tacsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a socialist Party's public benefit.
From the competition, 5000,000 HUF were obtained respectively, but did not use the money for the competition objectives.
In order to not be discovered, they presented the TMA five physical factures received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the factures found during the post record that Arpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
part of the accused will probably report in the court - as they did in the Fiscalia - the course of falsification of factures.
The most interesting can be the condemnation of the main accused Yanos Zuppo, if you decide to dismantle everything.
Since its confessions have not been very detailed, and although he repeatedly promised to speak about everything, this has not been done until the present.
The question is: What is interested to do?, for perhaps in change of the return of most money - 50 million HUF - socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi loves all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, was even able to be offended for these days, since to eliminate his career conditions, requested home arrest, but was reiterately rejected.
While the numerous authors of very high-value economic crimes who have never returned the money, they are free or at least can wait at their own home, he has no possibility for it.
Psychology of the oversets: Why do we pay more money?
The participants of the substances are intended to pay more money and excellence the product.
The neurologists and economicists of the University of New York found the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study appeared in Scientific magazine, people do not want to lose competitives such as eBay substances, so they prefer to pay a excessive price even.
Scientists tried to establish the neuroological scheme of this " game" through experimental substances.
One of the volunteer groups was playing lottery, the one participated in a substate, while the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) was reviewed by the active areas of the brain of persons involved in the experiment.
In both games, the participants could win the money, but during the substances, where it is an essential element to support more than the other, the game losing was intensified the functioning of the stretched complex under the brain cortex.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "precision auto" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in plants is explained as a prevention to not cause intense reaction of the road.
To found its theory, the economists of the Scientific Group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experience, three groups opposed one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated with the real value of the product concerned, and its integrants were posted.
Another group further was promised that, if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received $15 prior to the substance, but in the case of the loss of the substance, the integrators of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph and the other the failure was highlighted.
However, by verifying the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "the failure" were ready to support even more than the members of the control group and the "ganner group".
"This results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory previously.
Thus those until now explained the phenomena of the substances only with the joy of wining and preventing risks.
Only the visual neurological methods helped to solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now reach a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the economy power of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary the chronic disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of counted in this country is calculated in hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousands are treated because many of the nurses do not know that they are counted.
Hepatitis name is the common name of different illness diseases caused by virus.
The symptoms seem to be very much; they are characteristic the infection of the pharmaceutical and climate, but their pathogen agents and occasional diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruss dependent on pathogenic agents are propagated by two major forms: hepatitis A and E for food (e. g. with water or food contagious), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruss with blood and body humor (esperma, vaccine humor, saliva).
The travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of infected food, are shown by a general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After it appears in the skin and white of the eyes, the excretion is clear, the dark skin and the cure can take two - three weeks.
Any year, a million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic surgery caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one of each ten counted is receiving pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment can produce hepatic surgery and even cancer.
The majority of containers do not know that it is sick because this patholic agent is paulatinely destroying the hepatic cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
It is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tatuages.
Today there are some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be found with a laboratory routine control, it should be worth consulting the family doctor when experienced some unknown symptom.
The disease has cure if it is discovered at time, it is possible to exclude the body’s virus, so it can be eliminated and prevented cancer.
On September 30, it was the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized by nurses representatives in 2004.
Its aim is to call attention to the causes of the chronic infections of the virus caused by the virus and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it less pain to whom believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calm effect that also enabled the death of the matrix.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experience: analyzing how religious faith affects human pain - informed the British Telegraph newspaper.
In the context of this unique experience, electric shock applied to 12 Catholic believers and the same amount of athletes, while all were looking at a painting of Virginia.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the control of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which scientists, philosophys and theologists of the various departments of the University also participate on the side of the academics.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they set a chespering instrument to the left of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The investigators asked the participants of the experiment to finish their view in two paintings; to Virgen Maria, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Dame of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The investigators had the hope that the Virgin Mary spectacle would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful ones, while they chose the oil of Leonardo because he was not too different from the other, and they thought that he had a calm effect.
Patients passed a half hour in a MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric chocs in four subsequent parts while observing a religious topic painting or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when looking at Virginia Maria was feeling in "security" as people "protected", "settled and in their heart reigned peace".
When observing the religious theme table, they felt a 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such influential image you can get a similar effect with the atheis also, there is only need to find the appropriate image.
"We should find a person who feel very positive, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases of reality change our personality" - added Wright.
After these magnificent results, there is only one questionnaire: What effect would have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonard or another paintinger of his skin would be shown to the faithful ones?
Even though the vision of a Virginia of high quality Maria would make better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In his tenth anniversary, Google can say: you can find it both in the box of people as well as in the sky above your head; you know where your holidays happened, where doctors visit and what is interested in them.
But, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not yet enough.
Moreover, the sceptics that make a paralel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather the most possible personal data about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader, the company, even after ten years of work that returned to the World, is still at the initial stage of being able to treat all the information.
The question what's going on within five years Schmidt answered so: I would like Google to answer questions like "What do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work that I would agree?" - but software can not answer such simple questions while there are no sufficient information from users.
Not all internates are conscientious that during their navigation on the Network, the key words searched, IP addresses and pages have been set up when the search ended.
Thanks to Personalized Search that has been debugging two years ago, users can store their own navigation history, they can return to consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate more personalized searches - in this logic will be based on the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me itself, if they receive information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about seeing the Google informative monopolie.
In most cases, the potential represented by the company is what can be fearable and not a reordination, fear for punishment, anxiety for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they are not only conservating but also in reasonable cases, in third parties, all the claimed expressions, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internal persons.
The most discussed example of recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedofils, when Google gave him to the Brazilian government the information of his web page, called Orcus, to identify the pedofils.
Instead, international persons concerned about the rights of persons, in May, when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, immediately demonstrated to the court that had reasoned in the fight with the FBI: according to the sentence, it could not be obliged to Google, by any of the points of the Constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(Actually, the federal government has achieved its pretext to strengthen the child's protection law for some 50 thousand web addresses and some thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete web pages and key words of the last two months.)
This is quite contradicting the opinion about Google: they criticize those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their intimity is damaged, their private life when starting to use Google services, and rebellious against it as a multinational image companies.
While while, the geek-American culture and its enthusiasms followers, internate and users from other countries, come in them the future generation, the "vanguardy corporation", not as well as their rival, Microsoft, catalogued by their Windows as the world's conquistator, so much as both are in the same goal.
This may happen because Google on the other hand of Microsoft, does not request users any identification code, no money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborator than the practice of the official guiding of the software.
But it may also be because geek is precisely seeing the very difficult relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that is just one of the most key words mentioned in the past few years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is the collaboration, leave the intentional shoes behind us and use the available communication channels, and while the measures of these variables individually are still the same: show us yourself.
A normal young man may have profiles in many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, after these may include them in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, where the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of whom the girls are discovered, for example, when seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of the common friends, it is known with whom passed the previous night their fraudulent boyfriend or may be able to leave the employee of a company because this writes their sincere opinion in their blog on the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of private life has been completely recognised.
The "on line" life of a person is what she shows by himself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of the youth today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to escape Google's monopolie, can do it (e.g. by using the Google search system, but don't leave sheets).
Many people do not want to register on collective pages to avoid finding them, but can be replaced by Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to the image and reading applications of news with alternative versions, which are not connected to gigantic servers or preparing the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion almost expects openly the day in which Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 million is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies, while the services that are increasingly introduced are increasingly caused to serious head pains not only for Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the upper direction rejected routinely the protest of employees after duplicating the price of the child guard of the company, considering the limited number of employees of food, but it is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006, the company filtered all the information that violates the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service with preliance, but only when they were ready to work, what if it is sure is that the predictable problems of the next months and years can return to the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and book files and magazines of Google will buy such sizes that the company will soon quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our entire health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good matter for the scientist writers, the Scroogled, a newspaper of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in the future orweliana, where a man only of the Google data can be described alarmally well.
Two young ones of age helped to remove the wheels to the author of the double murderer of the city of Ozd.
The police asked to two ages of age about the double murder of Ozd who, according to the reasoned suspect, helped to remove the shoes of the crime - said on March the port of the General Commissioner of Public Order of the province of Borsod.
Young people acknowledged the crime that was sentenced to them, and they are currently accused of the crime infringement.
The two minors, according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency, are two girls, can be defended in freedom.
For compliance, you can receive up to 5 years of prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive detention since Sunday .
The crime is accused of murdering several persons with premeditation and co-meditation.
During the investigations, the teenage of 23 years of age had to be a large amount of 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so the Wednesday last week quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an Ozd company where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to MTI information, the young man has been prepared for the crime for a long time, since murdered with an previously hidden weapons on the place of crime.
The police analyzes with a expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Varsovia Bolsa offered a offer to buy the Prague Bolsa
The Varsovia Values Bowl offered twenty million euros - some 5 billion Czech Koreans - by 100 per cent of the actions of the Prague Values Bull.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Varsovia Values Bowl, confirmed the offer that the Polandians made, although previously the cheques have excluded the Varsovia Bolsa of the possible new owners of the Prague Bolsa.
The reason is that the Varsovia Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the actions are in hand of the Poland State that within a few months would like to sell 60 per cent of the same.
The Checo Economic Journal E15 reported that the offer of Polands has been the most higher among those who were offered by the Prague Bolsa.
According to the Czech press, until now they offered the Bolsa de Vienna, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Bolsa, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Bolsa and the German Burse.
Petr Koblic, the chief of the Prague Values Bowl last week, declared that among interested people the worst new owner would be the Varsovia Values Bowl and did not discover the possibility that, in a future disappear the Prague Values Bowl.
The experts calculate the value of the Prague Bolsa in some 5 to 10 billion corones.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the actions could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Values Balsa is the Patricia Financance Investment Bank with a participation of about 25 percent, the Ceká Sporitelna bank follows with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
on the financial crisis from the view of the European press
The main European daily newspapers in their march comments on the more deeply international financial crisis are talking about a "settled 11 September".
The global financial disaster should be the North American President - thinking the Republic of Rome - has not even been able to achieve the support of his own party for the law project, which is the objective of resolving this unexpected situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which was speaking by the multimillionary Winner Warren Buffett, is better talking about a "seventh Septe".
According to a part of the Madrilean press, Washington is the exposure key.
In view of the World's error of the United States' political direction, it was the one who brought the global economy to the border of abismo.
It grows increasingly the danger of the demobilization of the North American monetary system and then will impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote of the Congress, it appears the danger that Washington does not provide a political instrument to address the crisis.
World economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the largest transformations of capitalism history is carried out.
You can't make an opposite case to this threat - points the Day-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today are still able to cut it out of savings to the smooth financial institutions, saving them so from the struggle with the money of the contributors.
But if the domino is still more banks, then they will not be sufficient or new funds, nor the new funds.
The Member States of the European Union must leave their nationalist egoism and centralize control on fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in the crisis received only the moon more than 100 billion euros - remembering the coming of The Standard, adding that the more real concerns are that, as the North Americans have done, European contributors must also pay much money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not yet been severely occupied with the crisis that comes as a cluster for the Old Continent .
The "salvador" should not immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but would be good if they define: In what cases is justified to use the funds of the contributors to avoid a worse?
Intelligent car imitate the flight of the householder
What would the best method to develop technologies to avoid colisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the swimming ones.
In a surprising project presented in the Japanese CETEC, the awarders gave the start point to the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of colision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokio, designed the BR23C Robotic Guide System of Natural Autos, which gave him the features of the hosts, with the final objective of establishing a system that can evacuate all colisions.
During the flight each shipper creates his own special ovaled space, which is actually seeming very much to our security protection capsules - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exposure, RP technological director and development and research.
They develop an important role of the eyes that are able to see in all directions in an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composed eyes, engineers used the measuring system by laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that will immediately be transformed into a maneuver to avoid colision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot by imitating the swimming movements, change the direction by turning the routes in the necessary measure.
Unlike any existing systems, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not so, the vehicle robot could not react with the enough speed as to evacuate obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Labor and the project of vehicle robots.
It is necessary to react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable internal cables of the security protective capsules, in a cluster within which it is currently considered inevitable to all types of colisions.
Everything the process must reflect what it makes a pleasant to earn others.
This process must be performed in an open and closed eyes.
However, on the contrary of the legs, the movement cannot be moved up to the top, down or diagnose, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of the rounds
Thus, instead of the unfinished possibilities for swimming pools to escape other swimming pools, here only used as a possibility for the car robot and acceleration.
BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and more energy density, which means that they have a longer life duration than litio-ion.
According to Andoh, the importance is the instintive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, not much less than storage.
This device in each second should only process some entry signs and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instintive logical based on the data of the previous manuscripts, thus only uses some decades of memory.
No memory of gigabytes, nor megabytes.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately equip the obstacles, which, according to the Nissan calculations, can be included in the series-fabric models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to integrate the GPS satellite browser unit to bring the driver to his destination, striving the existing obstacles on his path.
He's already named this nice boy.
The written version of the financial savings package of $7,7 billion has been prepared in various phases to purchase the bad credits of the banks.
In the first stage, half of the money will be paid.
According to the East Coast time during the new consultations held until midday night, the leaders of the Congress reached an agreement around the financial rescue package of $7,7 billion in total, after several days of discussion, reported Reuters.
We have made a significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the North America Congress, and said that it is not just formalization of the agreement in a document.
The commitment taken on the package was supported by both candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment, stated: this programme will work and will be efficient but it is necessary for other measures. According to Pelosi, it is not to save Wall Street, but to bring it back to the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before the 8th night, according to Washington's time (or before two of the Monday's Monday, according to Central Europe), without making a spectacular salt in the bus.
On the draft law called emergency law for the economic stabilisation of 2008, the first Monday will vote on the North American Congress and then Senate.
President George W. Bush, on Saturday night, consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the portfolio of the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal for Bush administration to pay $7,7 billion to purchase fund values for bad quality credit.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars can be paid, using 250 billion immediately after the vote of the Congress, likely the Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase credit fund values, bad qualification and the destination of other $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be monitored by a special body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
Another half of the 700 billion dollars can be paid after a new decision of the Congress.
According to the Law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combinated tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad, hypothetics and credit fund fund fund funds, and also other "venenous" credits.
The purchase can be made in substances or in direct forms - informed relevant persons of the Ministry.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial card guarantees the concerning elements, for which the companys shall pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law guarantees the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, translating the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or risk prevention that could cause the demobilization of some major financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as they set it - acgrees.
Instead, the chiefs of the banks that are in squirrel and expected to support the State may contain the official limitation of their compensations, which the North American argot is simplely called gold paracayed.
Only in certain cases the payment will be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of support of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministerial purchase in the framework of a subscription, an additional tax shall be imposed for gold paracay, unless the bank's failure head is judged.
By buying directly bad credits, the Government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the compensation of heads is not exagerated.
In addition to that previous, the existing gold paracay contracts should not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate also the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the North America history that will be enforced by a legal limitation for the income of the Directors-General - said this measure the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Congress Committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also be entitled to purchase actions from the banks participating in the programme, so that the risk of the contributors will be reduced, as they can eventually even gain profits from the transaction in the recovery of the economy and the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the Chairman must submit to the Congress a proposal on the way to return the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there was both sides who expressed their reserves on the project.
This is not what the North American citizens commanded us, namely, they are not protecting the dollars of the contributors - declared the Republicn Congress in California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur stated: the measures were urged that they were responsible for the Wall Street's demobilization.

The next year will no longer be necessary to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities to take place around 12 January the North American and Hungary agreement on the exoneration of visa - the minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago, before the Hungary residents there.
In its view, "precisely everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry premium will be lost, but tourists should be registered before their outcome from the country of origin.
From today's head of Hungary diplomacy holds conversations in Washington.
The Secretariat of State Condolency Rice will be interviewed by delivering the Mediana Cruz with the Strategy of the Merito Order of the Republic of Hungary and supporting negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama Democrat and the Republic of John McCain.
Like Barack Obama, as McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the Presidency of the two large American parties, have provided their support on Sunday for the banking aid programme of $7,7 million of the Administration, in turn there are politicians that require the department of the Ministry of Finance.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration, after a number of days of marathon negotiations, announced the Sunday's Monday: a principle agreement on the financial rescue package of the banks was reached.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and disconnecting the frozen credit market, was converted into the central topic of the presidential election campaign.
Like Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more skills than their rival to get out of the country of economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when the economic issues were planned first, Obama returned to a certain advantage and dismissed the advantage of McCain who had been obtained after the convention of the Republicns with Sarah Palin' candidate to the vice-president.
In a mix of detroit campaign, celebrated last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the law on the package of $7,7 million.
He highlighted that the proposal includes the protection points of consumers, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger of employment, the horror of you. In addition, the whole industry and the stability of the whole economy," said a lot of 35.000 people.
He did not use the opportunity to calculate obsoletes' economic concepts of McCain.
In an interview granted to the ABC McCain, he explained that "We all bring this to hard punishments (...) but he doesn't do nothing just is not a viable way".
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the Minister of Finalities and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he was the one who stressed it.
Obama declared the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in consultations, instead he consulted daily with the Minister.
The President of the Nancy Pelosi Congress stated Sunday that the congressists would probably vote on the draft law.
Journal of Press of the German speaking area
The right group is intact, only that within the own group the most conscious electioners were converted - says The Spiegel about the weak result of the CSU in Baviera.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria in order to prevent red coalition.
The scene (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of Frank Walter, in its article titled "Baviera Revolution is dedicated to his parents" analyzes the reasons of the CSU's derogated drama.
According to the well-known polytolog, the CSU's erosion had been launched long before Beckstein-Huber's sad dog had taken his duty.
The social Christians for several decades were developed in Baviera - and now these modern citizens are those who give it to it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not absolutely surprising for the CSU but the Sunday ended a process that had been expected for almost ten years: the unacceptable hegemony of a state party was disappeared.
10 years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 50.7 per cent.
This has been repeated three years ago, in the 2005 federal elections, that is, yet, during the same time, it was Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devoring province of its progenitors .
Sociologs have been pronouncing this 40 years ago, but in the rythm they were very wrong, but secularization, the results of the education and residence of the Northern Germans in the developed regions of Baviera had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU electors.
Modernization also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only that within the own group the most conscious, more critical and more testars were converted.
It is surprising that in the past few weeks just the conventional groups of citizens were more than the CSU; the autonomes, the small industrials, those who have bachelerated and diplomates.
Thus, less than 40 per cent of the support to the CSU was recruited.
Press (depresse.com)
The conservator newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom?" in its article entitled "The Presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition issues" - is concerned with the confused situation of the internal policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPEC wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The EVP prohibits that the SPUE should be imposed in its internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all addresses to be negotiated, and the green green still do not want to consult coalition.
The elections were already held, now all around the coalition; in the debate held in the public television, the leaders of the party only left to see something of their barajas.
Warner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPUE wants to demonstrate that cooperation between two parties is possible - this exists in certain provinces and social partnerships.
Fayman left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EVP, at the position of vicecanciller.
He stated that in any case the era of Schüssel-Molterer was disappointed.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red offers.
He said that the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to impose the internal matters of the AVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter into the coalition, these questions must be discussed in any of the own EPAP.
Jörg Haider's President, Jörg Haider, opened in all addresses.
"In order to prevent the red-natural coalition, we are willing to take the government's responsibility," said Haider.
Yaroka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equality has been launched in Paris, its advisory is France that this year is also the President of the European Union.
Livia Yaroka, deputy of the European People ' s Party for Fidesz, in his full message, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called on the attention of the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations of the giant kids and also the greatest obstacle to the prevail of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugured - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
They attended the meeting of representatives of Governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organizations.
Yaroka, according to the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament, warned that, in addition to the discrimination in employment, the Guyana remained outside the labour market first by their low-level school level.
"The majority of young giantians have not completed the media and because of the bad quality of basic education, so only one insignificant part can get university diploma."
Jaroka also stressed that education, as fundamental human rights, has a decisive role in the prevaluation of other human rights.
Investment in the education of giant children to a premature age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Deputy, these issues must be widely conciliated between the Guyana and the non-Gidans.
As soon as the school starts, there will be more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through profit and consumption taxes will also contribute to the national budget.
"To giant as citizens of the European Union, they must ensure their right to quality education and ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," said Livia Yaroka.
According to the European Deputy, the objective and active unit of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate school desegregation processes, so it is essential that existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be correctly compliance.
"They have to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, there is a need to provide the possibility to ensure the democratic space that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights."
The goal of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year in the sign of the "European Year of equal opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European level and at national level of Member States.
CSU: thanks for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision on the success of the failure of Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral derogation, there have yet been no heads on the tops of the Bavarian CSU, at the time the debate on personal issues has been posted.
Erwin Huber, Chairman of the Game and Sunther Beckstein, the first Provincial Minister still remain in his posts, but it is not known until when the grace will take place.
The happiness of the double, which has suffered an electoral disaster of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The integrators of the such critical duo left interrupting: they do not so much to their posts.
In this way they intended to tranquilize the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" requested personal consequences because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - even under Edmund Stoiber's direction that was on the top of his car - the Christian social unity reached a 60.7 percent, in change now, a year after the shock tested against Stoiber, just 43.4 percent.
The CSU had 46 years of "monopolio" in Baviera, which gave 18 percent of the German PBI.
While in the province of the South, with key importance for the Hungary economy, conservators continue to predominantly, in the future without doubt should be coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of the possible Huber's successors, also has a position in the reduced intellectual group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Rights Free Elections on a possible governance coalition in Munich.
The weird destination is that in the list of the Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli's parliament, whose action against Stoiber was used for the shooter of the Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the scenario to the local political ambition.
The CSU's maximum leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that until now he moved the funds, the former Provincial and former president of the CSU qualified on September 28 as the most amazing day of his political carriage.
The Monday Huber made some critical comments to the DDC, in his view, they would have much more supported the brother party.
Other politicians of the CSU also interpreted the derogation as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Federal Tag elections of September 2009, Merkel could not be shocked if they are not able to realize together with the CSU who played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, he could hide his deception for failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the large Berlin coalition.
What, of course, is relative: it will not be more easy to treat the damage of the CSU and the crisis of continuous social democrats.
The SPD with 18.6 percent has reached its worst result since 1946 in Baviera.
The opposition of Lukashenk: 110-0
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no opposer in the Belarus Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and the stability guaranteed in the country of Alexandre Lukashenko, instead of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is better explained by the violations of the law committed during the vote account.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
While the legislation of the country of 10 million people, integrated by hundred and ten Members, has no opposition for more than one decade ago, before the elections to eve the unified opposition under the name of the Democratic Forces of the United Nations (ODSZ), expected that Lukashenko, who four times renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of doubts legitimacy, as a result of the change of the Constitution, would "accepte" the entry of some Members of the opposition in the Parliament.
Thus the ODSZ removed the boicot that he originally wanted to do.
In the background of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which was more economically depending on Russia - who took a credit to modify the import of natural gas more likely than Russia and contributed to the sale in Russia of Beltrasgaz, the owner of the gas that passed by the country - wanted to improve their relationships with the European Union, which did not allow Lukashenko and other high-level politicians to have a considerated anti-democratic regime.
It was a sign of disappearance when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized better on positive phenomenas and not on errors - such as the prohibition to participate in a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the primary report of the Monday of the OSCE also criticized the campaign - in which the candidates of opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be presented in the vote account.
With all this opposition, it is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners and Minsk are available to a small confrontation with Moscow, rejecting the recognition of the separation of South Ocean and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically represents a federal state - a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
- We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been launched - has declared to our journal Alexandre Milinkevich.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable to keep this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of such an opposition to that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not intend to organize protests when seeing results, but try to reach the electors their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This is clearly caused by many problems because we must print the press of opposition in Russia, local authorities make difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that they are more than those who support the change between the age of age also - said Milinkevich, makes an allusion to the Lukashenko regime, who believes that their main result is the creation of social security, not even considered appropriate to the juveniles, which are officially the most subvented by the regime.
Because of the debt of the country and the increased trade deficit, the decomposition of social security is only a question of time - Milinkevich believed.
The Russian observers against the opposition policy qualificated democraticly to elections.
Serguei Lebetev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, declared the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in the words but in the facts," so that the lack of opposition is not another thing than the witness of the mature of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "Something now, before starting working."
It has never occurred in the Palacio Chigi History that they have got automatic doors to control the entry and out of the staff.
But since today it starts with this measure against whom it is set and then goes to the bar to take a coffee in worktime time.
This newness has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatical doors say Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the Minister needs.
"A new time of responsibility and transparency is now open.
This is Reformism", underlined by new Brunetta.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council's presidency.
For Masi "The selection of the automatic doors is also important from the symbolic view".
No resistance was found by employees, assured the secretariat-General: "he has been a shared change by workers and the cooperation of the employees."
Finally, not more work-time breakfast; no more coffee and mid-moon.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, is: "A good capuchin at 7 of the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, it means 600,000 more than the job in one year."
And adds that public administration is more effective
Italian, "the wage dynamics – the Minister, in the past 8-10 years have been dual in respect of the private sector and well above the inflation level".
For now, millions of public employees have been united to oppose the standards of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
"When the Minister of Public Function shows numbers, the less autentic work for diseases – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vagos workers' is continuously increased.
In Italy, millions of employees of the correct and productive public administration have been united to declare war with the evil standards of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of economic treatments acgreed by illness due to service; the extension of the timelines in which the medical control visits of the nursed employee are carried out and other aspects contained in the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirmed that white deaths have been about 1.200.
Numbers that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and cause almost a double of deaths in respect of murder.
To call on the attention of institutions, social forces and information about this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by victims of labour accidents institutionally established on October 2.
"The worried data distributed by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm as essential as the question of prevention in the work," said the President of the Napolitan Republic, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, Mutilated and Invalid National Association for Work, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its “grace of the continuing partnership in favour of prevention in the place of work, protection of lossed workers, assistance to the families of victims and the sensibilisation of public opinion”.
"A 'bast' has been demonstrated, sincerely shared, in front of tragedies that, by its sizes, raises the clamper of the media and the participation of the public view, instead of the cotidian reality, we propose dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that " there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is to take the numerous school-based initiatives to make a more direct conscience of young people in the world of work.
It is a duty to maintain the attention to the phenomenon, not to move the alarm on social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
By its part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which opposes the conscience of each of us and imposes all institutions a decisive attempt to bring an urgent end."
"Date on the accidents in the work seem to indicate a slight and slow path, but this doesn't want to make the number of white deaths too impressive", noted the President of Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't really want this "reducing tension" to be translated in less attention, because it is just when the attention decreases the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level is still too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the media can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, at our criteria - has highlighted Mercandelli - higher controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world. "
"It is a further effort - he has added - in order to concentrate the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
However, it serves a greater sense of responsibilities from employees about a phenomenon representing social emergency."
Mercandelli has declared "the progressive deterioration of the subsidiary protection level for the victims of the work" and the "assistant deficiency to which the system is directed in the past years".
"The goal is to return to the employer's assurance guarantee - he has adhered – because the luck of whose accident is not to have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
MP3 readers under charge, risk hearing
Listen to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent illness to hear.
It refers to the European Commission, which in a disseminated communication in Brussel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission of emergency and recently identified health risk (Csserri) of the Ue, published today.
"Withing this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – is that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices every day over a hour of hour, holding the high volume device is a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm worried that such a high number of young people that use often portable musical devices and cellular phones at high-level can inconsistently ruin their ears in an unremeditable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Withful tests – continue the responsibility Ue – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
Whatever accounts, it is to sensibilize consumers and to make this public domain information.
We must also review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific view, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, regarding the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the rude that it originates.
Scientists - concludes the Ue executive - confirm that it is a cause of concern, and the European Commission will now review together with Member States and interested parties that measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure from portable musical devices and devices.
Today, there is already a European security standard that limits the ruling level of the portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increased as a hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of brush.
Such damages can be limited by recurring to solutions such as reduction of levels and the time of speech exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue provides that the users of portable music devices listen to high volume (mas 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit in force on the maximum permitted sound in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions, but long-term periods, cause a permanent loss of auditive capacity after a 5-year period.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2,5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany from the way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, in March, the accounts will be held in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new seat behind the Charcalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the joint and the Joint Board evaluate analysis and projects, in order to submit in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official Ballo" of the Municipality and its willing Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – aimed at sublineing German – must provide proposals for the development of Rome, where those who have politically decided, together and municipal advice can then be defeated.
There is no sovereign position of roles, just the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
The work will be lost in March, because this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June – announces the purpose – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
As its opinions are not binding, Germany responds: "All depends on the work that will be able to implement the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and I am also sure in Rome, its support will be essential.
The policy is almost always in the ordinary and urgency management, which are backwarded..
We, on the contrary, want to look at it but on the long and long term, in a deep and deep perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The aim of Rome also is to point out that "This Commission is not an inutile entity or banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost an euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to participate and raise the best minds expressing the capital."
For Germany, in fact, "If you need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or inmovil, to allow our city to make a real level salt, of which we have absolute need, thinking with an unilateral spirit to its future."
A future that, needing the purpose of Rome, would not only be limited to the current common borders but also look at it "not only to the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also to consider the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He wrote a American political note that is interested in spend independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions cleaned the United States economy and the tube relationships (as it is also today from private citizens) with the Islamic enemy."
They increase the attacks against Obama while the date of elections is near.
She wrote a Lady of Miami on a web: "This person is filled with ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he wins the highest charge of the nation that has had two rulers and five black senators!".
They are in fact attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and do not answer the question of the electors: will it be a good president? And they are also sondees; everyone say that Obama will win and benefit.
In this case, there is also one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A journal of the Mississippi, in the wings of the south of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the castle to vote, we will know who will vote the American patriote.
Get out of a side of the US mentality covered up to the last.
"True what you want, we'll think after the cross, if about Obama or McCain."
There's people who swear: if it comes to win Obama, we'll go from America.
This is never before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winner weapon for the democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during their mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50.000 soldiers and sent it home to casts in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the valves.
Similarly, Irak for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever will hold the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Using, the economic failure is also feeling for journalists: in the newspapers it is time of cuts. Many gives the Internet's fault, "assis" of the printed paper.
Five American journalists have been interpeled by PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pesimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated to feel less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the courts carried out in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, is a great problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if the traditional periodism, as the majority of the public understands, is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pesimism predominant today about the American journalist.
Six over ten journalists and executives are convinced that periodism at national level follows a wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Implementation against emissions.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest editorial houses are opened up a break on the Internet, for many views as the "assistant" of the printing letter.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists warned has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are cutting the technology in hope "what do something good" by periodism.
The largest routine in the American journalism is among whom the newspapers – or directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of the national executives are certain that their journalists share the same values, while locally less than 23 per cent.
For some this, you have to see the "security of the work".
The executives that think to lose the job in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
The periodic staff is 30 per cent.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always at the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In a large country such as the United States, with 300 million people and 300 million newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and internet employees often offer what they want and become a question of "total or leave it".
The directors receive almost always good payments, while the editors can win up to $10,000 per month, but the jubilation and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their appointment, are "held" followed during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF ROMA, COPOL TO THE CHAPPLE IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobilier Danilo Coppola that he had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrada, to a room in the city of Rome.
Copy this bond by banking in the field of anti-contraction investigation at the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process on its charge, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into forced residence in Grottaferrada.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate to run the road from the city of province to a capital room.
According to the court, these travels (for which the pm has voted in contrary votes) would allow him to influence your society and access the evidence they condemn it.
Elites in danger
A few days ago, the phenomenon had been demonstrated with the vote of the camera of representatives against the rescue plan of 700 million dollars employed by the White House: a significant part of the Americans was, and this, but interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
We confirm the New York Times last night report that the current crisis is disarmed by the Republican party, always but shared between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and community business institutions, and its new soul, in turn, conservator, enemy to the "featers of Washington" and the world of the financials, strongly overcome in the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the voice of whom he spoke to the principle.
This is only a example of the changes, the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but also in all Western and not only here.
It seems to be in the United States as in Europe for many years as incubating phenomenas that with the new climate they solidize and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereign category regarding a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank-financing institutions, which have, if, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, are increasingly compromised with the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who governs it is, namely, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and the families that, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically, but it is politically and exclusively national.
The internationalism seems substantially outside the game or has no lot to say: the crucial test is the European Union that is divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies does not get to decide any common policy.
It is from the Government of each state that all are expected to have an intervention, rescue plans and reactivation, new rules, and above all the fund granting: since the court is only the state that has the economic resources and the amount of financial resources to reduce things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimation to use them: two incalculable value resources, values in certain circumstances where no market probably and no organization can never be available in the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect symptoms, with the greatest importance that the new development of the economy aims to allocate it to a very linked factor to this element: territoriality.
Paradogially, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of the technologie always but sophisticated, of the inmaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will make the accounts always, but with little things like water, culture and oil.
Everything that may be certainly transported from one place to the other of the land but are also bound in an absolutely circumscribed space, a territory.
So who is a sovereign, he certainly has many more letters about whom he is not, and who has the desire to live in an uncultural place without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that I'm taking a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says policy and leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective conscience of the need for a leadership is the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredited for existing leaders, inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together something more deeply and in a certain worried sense: a discredited, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of lejany, which aims to imply all the leading class of the Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to be more advanced, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now, the same way to feel and to be, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the views of the majority.
The demand of leadership, in a few words, is subterraneously a ratified but powerful movement of the leadership and traditional political structures, which are shown in an electoral "revutale" or in the slowly changes of collective humors of these recent times, from the conservative outdoor in Austria-Baviera to the failure of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of men of the American congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy which has something to see).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rides, their newspapers, their intellectuals, their format would say somewhere, make it more difficult to understand and then represent, what has been taken today is the deepest roads of Western society and that the economic crisis renewed, growing and potentially affected.
Before all this, it speaks of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exagerated.
But hold open eyes aren't it.
The super piece to walk on the walls
Winning the serious laws thanks to a super pigment and in a future walk on the walls like the aran man.
It is the goal of several American research centres, and a team of four institutions has now been very closed.
With an adhesive of only 2,5 cm squared scientists could have taken a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The American Journal of Science has published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing that uses a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubs.
“The principle of the pigment can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaguetis pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the shoes of gecos, recruited by the microscopics that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
The tests made on different materials such as vision, tillion, and paper of liya have shown that the new adhesive is ten times but powerful of the patates of this reptil, and at the same time "is easy out of the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the power of the Engineering University of Dayton.
CAMINAR ON THE PAREDES? -"This material may be useful as a transitional adhesion" adds Liming Day.
Can you walk through the walls exactly like the araña man? You know, but researchers think to a very less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because the nanotubs of carbon are heat and electric flow drivers.
Other applications may have to be considered with the airspace engineering.
There's nothing of superheroes at the time.
OR INVESTIGATION - also the University of Berkeley in California is dedicated to the search of a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian students have presented an adhesive fact of micro fibers as hairs that are cleaning the powder during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adherence.
Pharmacies: never with fruit game
Attention to the pommel juice, the naranja and the ring.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich vitamins, if they are taken with some medicines, change their absorption by simplifying or decrease according to the case, effectiveness with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices, freshly associated with the absorption of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, from the 236th National Chemical Society in the course of Filadelphia, sent a new alarm: enough pomelet vessel, naranja and manzana in order to reduce absorption of some pharmacies, cancelling the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The pomelo jugo was already in charge because it was retained responsible for increased toxic levels some antiarrithmic, antibiotic, angiolytic, antihistaminical and neurological medicines.
FARMACOS RIESGOS – The same Italian pharmaceutical Agency had given the news in a board of information two years ago by alarming doctors and patients not to subsiste the risk resulting from this mixture and to take care of what drinks are taken in the case, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NEW SOLO POMELO – According to experts, the naranja juice and the sweet contained substances that inhibit medications.
A long list of active principles inhibited by the pommel and other games.
From here, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "This discoverings are generally indicated to the various international and national pharmacist agencies that may eventually enable to change the information notes of the same.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the illustrative pharmaceuticals of the medicines that are living and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmaceutical” underlined the expert of the Ansa Agency.
The Economic News to Paul Krugman
The nobel economic prize has been assigned to the United States Paul Krugman for its studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neighbor who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times editorial notes.
Krugman is one of the most critical ones of the Bush administration decisions regarding economy and external policy.
A few months after the notice of 11 September 2001, Krugman was expected to be editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be but decisive that the first, in consequent terms for the United States.
A prediction that decreases a lot of polyemics and that for several years has been revoked to the economy, but that is now clear.
"I'm a little surprised and a little sharp of how the memory of Enron's and Worldcom's failure scandal have disappeared rapidly from the public's attention," Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a 'economist of great value', but also a distributor with a very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of the liberalism of Bush administration."
Open Office, eco the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 launch, the open source of personal productivity that aims to attractive always but users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work of voluntary developers, which are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: to the Welcome screen and the less biggest review interface, they are added to other more consistent, such as the compatibility for the Mac OS X operational system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the last standard ISO version.
Attention also to multi-operation with the Suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.douch, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as which allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, for example, to send it electronically, or to import the PDF file into the graphical processing module, by maintaining the original aspect of the page.
Always on this background can be created "Hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphic of Adobe with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text editor.
The Cooperation is a element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, they can be involved in different users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the development of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some enterprises are also working to carry out some functions from OpenOffice to the Web ( on the cloud on the clouds) and should give the final result in the next weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded in the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html and adds to the English that was found in the view from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is available for the Linux operating system.
A request may also be sent the cd of installation to home or to work.
And if the theme of free may be a gang for dissemination in houses, it is in business area that Open Office is the testing suite, try the big platform, and it can already be counted with several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And not even the realities offering a training, consultations and ideal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business perspectives can be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of known Access is the program that can work on the base date; and last Draw the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and it is likely that we have reached almost 3 million million to now, with the output of the new version, it is possible to exceed the expected number.
Positive COl result is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third-classified and winner of the best rather of the scaler.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equip.
Kohl, 26 years of age is the fourth positive corredor at the Epo of Third Generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricô and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also they from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of the carbon blood camps enter between those carried out in the lab of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry last weeks.
If the against tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position to the Tour and smile against the two years of canonic discalling.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the Epo of the third generation is the chief of the French antidoping Agency, Pierre Bordry, who stated to the Association Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
Austria has 26 years of age been placed in the podium at the edges of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, joining the best scaler.
INMIGRANTS: WHAT YORK TIMES ON PREGUNTA, ITALIA WHAT?
Italy from the employee country has been only recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" accompanied with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a country of racists? It is what the New York Times is asked in a long article dedicated to the debate on the racism in Italy by part of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originary of Burkina Faso murdered in Milan for having robbed a galletite box.
This is evidence of what the New York Times defines the "north paradoxy": the northern regions are at the same time where "mas integration and work" are registered but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the highest support of the Northern link".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also quoted intolerance episodes in Milán, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation that the League apprehended the immigration train and facilitates the expulsion of citizens is quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence is marked by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Napolitano, finding Benedicto XVI at the Congress, has requested that the State and church work together to fight racism."
Travellers victims, up to 900 euros for a room
The market for universities does not know the crisis.
According to Sunia’s last survey, in Florence, a private room was able to accommodate a 900 euro student in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napolis, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the high costs that the family would have to support – explaining the responsibility of the Sunia’s study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities, the strong demand has completely deformed the market in this point to develop a generally increased process until the residents. "
In addition, in most cases, household offers contain a number of violations: typical, unregistered, unlimited, under linked equipment.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions can be regulated by the review of tax taxes.
Seeing the survey, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brisa area, there are approximately 450 euros; by a single room from at least 650 (Nighty Band zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed costs average €350/400, a room around 700.
In Bolivia, where students are concentrated in the nearby university areas, 250/280 euros service for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in central areas near University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolivia) are requested for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only less but low values ($550 per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Science).
Economy is only if it changes the peripheral area: EUR 300 per bed and 450 for a individual room in the Prenestina area, Centokelle and around.
In Napolis for a bed you are EUR 300/450, with the highest prices in the Policinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in towns but girls prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of accommodation to students and foreign students is more frequent, a further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of canon to foreign students regarding Italians.
Welcome to the old film Paradise, the cities cancel the historical rooms
The historical cinematographic rooms closed by promoting the multiplex.
"A city without film rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eye."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornator is effectively photod in the large cities of Italy and also in provinces.
The channel marginalization process, which is an inevitable and inevitable event with all the features of a true cultural crime, is with the birth of the great meticons in Periferia and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, such as if he died a friend, a known part of which was shared with a place and so emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise cine, the film that was twenty years ago wins the first Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, which accounted for the poetry of a provincial cine room and nostalgia for the way to live the movie that may have lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of commercialists are clear: in the past five years they closed 316 traditional Chineses, and most of them are over 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napolis, Boloni and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions but suffered by the clores are as the first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 chines less, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsibilities of his disappearance are the multix event, are itself these three Italian regions that have made recording the largest number of new metic cines: 195 paintings but in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 is in Toscana and Emilia-Romaña.
“The Italian exercise has been irracionally developed” observes Paul Protti, President of Anec, would be useful that new structures would be built but it would be necessary to ensure the remaining of those existing, because when a city room closes, not all its frequencies are ready to transfer to the meticons.
Not talking about the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is around 10 million euros.
It is angry from the ethic and moral view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
In the interest of the case of Bolivia, the first Italian city that was concerned about the closures, decided to repair the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono chamber is in the historical center of Periferia.
Among the planned standards exist a mediated tax facilitation for the managers and benefits of the public in terms of mobility: spectrums can enter the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for the station.
"It's a initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornator, and I hope other cities continue the example of Bolivia by putting up other measures.
It is true, in contrast with the extra power of the meticons, traditional rooms must improve the quality of sound and image because the public is now more demanding.
The defense of traditional cine is a theme that was always important for me: the closure of the cine of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chispa that convinced me to carry out the "New Paradise cine" that I had already thought for 10 years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the Rialto or the Cyril of National Trade already closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, to not see the cards engraved by the pool, I turn to the other side."
Lazo between policy and ringheta, the Chamber of Gioia Tauro was arrested
"The Alcalde of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municium for interested people in the Cosca Piromalli."
The accusers of the Antimafia Directory of Calabria give the intending and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio From Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafious association.
Also arrested Joacchino Piromalli, the intermediate elder between the clan and the public administration, and his grandfather, the boss' honour, already condemned by mafious criminal association and compensated 10 million euros.
"Froming any legal and moral standards, and in good sense," the applicants write, the two local administrations had expressed the will of pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafious family – write the judges - to get in officially within the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and commanding the public administration."
The Chairman of the regional calabrés Agacio Loiero does not hide that "The agreements between the bad organized life are a lot" in its region: "There are areas where mafious intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians that resist the pressure of the 'andrangheta, heroes that keep clean."
The arrests of this morning are added to those of the last July after the police had announced the head court of the mafious Piromalli family.
Since the end of April, the municipal Council of Gioia Tauro had already been dissolved, in 1991 and always by presuming conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been subjected to the burden of the municipality.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, intendingly, of the Udc at the time of dissolving, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as a leader of a right centre coalition.
I exploit a scandale when the Prefecture orders the dissolving of the municipal Council.
I call on the Vice-Minister of the Interior, who was Marco Minniti at that time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, judges write, "the availability to promote the requirements of a entrepreneur, representing a very close group of Piromalli clan, harmonizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of mafious families."
When the energy is born from the oaks, the bigs are down to the scene
It is an exterminated increase that is more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the great world energy companies.
Those, flights, mares are the new renewable sources on which they look like Chevron.
The possibility of recursion of marine movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, investigations have been intensified.
When the price of the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was separated, but now the environmental cases and the new increase in the oil makes an impulsion to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the global electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the sea halls.
This amount would be the double of the production currently produced by the nuclear centers.
And it would be the flights and the seas.
Weird to attack.
The first company to support marine energy has been Enersis, which 2005 has entered an agreement to build an implant in the Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it was a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to support marine energy are always but among these companies that have always voted through traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technology – it has declared the portfolio of a company associated with the US oil oil newspaper at the Wall Street Journal – and it is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned is about the obtaining a permission of the United States Energy Commission, to implement a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a quite important sign, if the EU is considered in Alaska continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to implement new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and the New Jersey Ocean Power to follow the way energy coming from the sea, the total invested to now, although not detailedly indicates an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still starting, because marine energy is not doubting that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, the effects such as the Portugals or the Scotias are slightly slightly and they do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce long-scale energy, a technology should be used with a greater environmental impact.
And options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system between them.
The force of the oils, which makes move the goods up and down, becomes water pressure with pistones and cylinders inside the same.
The pressure makes a turbine turning a generator at its time.
The electricity is sent to the coast through submarino cables.
For now, four of this type's implants in development, at the time of the federal approval, in part of energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, instead, has already produced energy for a commercial center and for a station, using submarino turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are merries, it turns the balls of the turbines, creating a rotative movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers at waiting for the authorisations required to use energy.
After the shoes, the seas.
A particular interest, they say in the Electronic Energy Institute, is now the potential of marine.
Although it is a intermediate phenomenon, the seas are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the oils, and therefore it is, but reliable as the source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the marine states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others near the coasts, has invested $7 million in 2008 and is expected to be investmentd in 2009.
