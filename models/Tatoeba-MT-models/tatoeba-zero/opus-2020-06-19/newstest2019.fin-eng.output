In the United States, the powerful document tells us why the absorption rights are delayed.
The United States' Senate tries to find out whether one of the nine members of the law could be elected by President Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump.
In the Republic of the Republic, many hopes that the resolved vote of Kavanaugh would be revoked against Roe, a renowned decision in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg’s documentary photo Reversing Roe - the United States and Aborption Rights tells how the current account has been held over the years.
As incredibly as it feels, the subject is timely also in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sing) has made public work against a safe abortment and has received a variety of support from our country-based people.
At the beginning of a powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only aborted in the state of Missouri, is a doctor.
An armed clinic guard tells his defense of the freedom of religious freedom of the United States.
News videos remember the terrorist attacks that have been killed in clinical clinics.
Let's move at the time that the abortion was in the United States.
The association of the Lutheran churches taught at women who trusted abortisms at that time.
The reasons for the pastor who has been deceived are good, but indeed they don't even need, the picture made by an abortion that has been killed is enough.
The dead were in the United States for about 5000 years.
The legal defence of Aboriginals was particularly the Republic of the United States.
Since 1967, the Aboriginal Act was signed by President Ronald Reagan.
Afterwards, Reagan, Presidential Championship in 1980, began translating the religion to strike the voters of the policy.
His abortion was also shocked by his followers George Bush's parents.
And the same thing did Donald Trump.
The more deeply documentation will be made when searching for the basis for the policy of abortion.
When the race of religious organizations were dismissed from taxes, they became politically active.
The abort was chosen for the kitchen.
Religion has produced exceptional clusters in the policy.
This writes in the U.S. situation in which the votes of the religious right in the Aboriginal kanadian have chosen the highest right candidate to Kavanaugh, whose number of women now condemned sexual disaster.
Kavanaugh may obtain an English authority to decide on 164 million American women and girls' rights.
The Israelite army shooted seven Palestinians on the border of two children
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in the middle of the year when Israel had come to the crowd of the border.
Israeli soldiers shooted on Sunday by the seven Palestinian borders Gaza, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

These 89 were shocked from the creatures.
The Israelite army has reaffirmed that it opened the fire and made an explanation to the border, when the inspirators cast the men of Israel with stones and explosions.
The army says that he has initiated a powerful force that the defenders do not throw up the border aid or strike it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians died in Gaza’s remarks after March, in which the Palestinians started weekly discovery on the border.
Under the UN Human Rights Authority, indeed 12 000.
Reviewers require access to Palestinian families to areas where the Palestinians had to go when Israel’s country was established in 1948.
The Palestinian shooter has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explorations in the Palestinian lakes and the helium balls have decreased forest areas and farming countries in Israel.
Theme Bukki bought a punishment pocket. You didn't have to shoot yourself.
Wigan's chief Chey Dunkley showed him in the back of the punishment area.
The distintor Gavin Ward gave the game to continue.
He said he was clean.
The theme Pukki couldn't believe in his eyes.
Your condition would remain to be hard for the disaster Wardia who condemned Norwich's 85-minute punishment pocket when Pukki was lost.
Ward looked like a punishment film, and Mario Vrancic was a 1-0-functional.
The shoe is made to Norwich five lands in the Mastership Search.
Previous born last Sunday, against QPR, was slightly slowly born with the demand of rail.
I'm going to be working again for Puk.
When the ball was lost, he continued the situation until the end.
He put the landscapes and defended him unfortunately.
The Norwich fight was five in two weeks.
Somebody's still in the ligacup.
There's a five-weapon pieces behind.
Pedofil's support was immediately filled with the resources - in Finland about 400,000 experiences are interested in children.
According to the evaluation, two per cent of men and small parts of women experience at least some of the sexual interests in the exhibition age.
Finnish this means about 40,000 people.
For children or young people sexually interested has been difficult to get help.
The Joint SeriE project for Criminal Training and Sexpon will train professional pedofils as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in a slightly slow, the e-mail in Sexp offering consultations and therapy was shocked very quickly to end, General reports.
However, these are promised to be a measure of freedom.
A child’s sexual appreciation causes many abuses.
Most pedophysic feelings in itself have not performed their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, consideration is generally a permanent quality.
Most of them hopes to differ from the thoughts that suffer and distress them.
They also challenge normal life, says General Sexual Thesleff, Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special reporter in the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child is engaged in sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Coreo leaders or Congo Gynecologists?
The U.S. President Donald Trump Nobel's Peace Loans can be a wonderful idea, but Trump is based on the funds of the funds for the rewards, one of the most favourable ones.
The background of Trump is the role of the North Korean, at least at the level of the talks, to join its nuclear weapons.
On the basis of the report, the largest recommendations for the peace of Nobel are the President of President Moon Jae and North Korea, who have already met three times this year, and have promised to pursue the peace agreement between their countries.
The temperature between the corees is significant, as the last year was good.
Nevertheless, the rewarding of Kim, who has caused nuclear threats and the earthquake, would also be critical.
The receivers of Nobel banks are published since Monday, and the most higher payment is in the mountain.
If the payment is not given to the name of Korean participants, it is one of the candidates of the Congo Doctor Denis Mukwege.
Assessed jinecology has been treated in its hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo by thousands of women who have been victims of violent races and who have risen as specialists in the world.
Mukwege has been working to focus on sexual violence, which is a delicate site of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been held by the United Nations Refugee Organization, who wins Nobel's peace loan in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has reported that this year income is 331 candidates.
The name of the proposals will not be told to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't put it bad if Nobel could.
In May, the supplier asked him to be in the White House whether he thinks that it was a peace loan.
Everything agreed, but I never would say that, Trump said to the sweet.
I want to get this ready.
I would like to win the whole world, the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are things that do Trump's Nobel to be unreasonable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often recognized the persons and organizations representing liberal democracy and many of the world-wide democracy - just an international cooperation that Trump has seen as a opposer.
In the 2000s, the reward has received three United States policy, which all have been democratic: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, the compensation of Trump was required from the Nobel Committee for the full ideological translation.
Smoking in the tunnel: cars were conducted as soups and drived into a wrong direction
On September 8th, a traffic gas in Loja was held in the whole.
The traffic of the tunnel Area was defeated in the direction of Turu and Helsinki.
When we find out that this is systematic, the pillar is trying to get the normal traffic.
However, it did not get too fast.
We tried to open the road once ago, but the Centre of Transport said that it couldn't be open, because there are car drivers in the same way, and they think how it happens, the swimming Master Pasi Caireen told the STT at that time.
The motor was then coming to move even in a false direction only after an expectation.
When the first starts to operate against transport rules, some others are often following, but Heskana's Heskane's Headquarters' communications are surprising.
According to the rules of movement, motors and tunnels shall not be stopped as a forced reason.
Transport security recalls that in exceptional situations, it may not be able to avoid transporting traffic in disadvantaged solutions.
The alarm schedules shall always be given the most possible movement.
In particular, the motion of the motor engine has been prohibited, as well as the translation of U and the removal of the translation.
Similar bans are also enabled in tunnels, in which also have always to be able to skilled.
Any stopping without a forced reason has been prohibited, as maybe the stopping room is also.
There were even cases in which the driver has stopped in the tunnel to cut the shoes in his car.
It should be clear that there should be a wrong place and time to the employee in question, and he said in the information on the Transport Security.
The Elves fans would have wanted to continue to celebrate, even though the ship left on the base of the sea.
Inland waterways M/S Tampere, Ilves fans would like to stay on their ship to continue to the winning party, although the ship had remained on the base of the river, reports Juho Syrja on the principal occasion of the ship.
M/S Tampere traveled to Tampere afternoon on Saturday evening and left his shoe on the base of the Old Water Aca.
The ship was 19 passengers and five men were evacuated on the ground at night.
No one was hurted in the harbor.
The Elves fans would like to continue on their ships until the morning, but it was probably more funny to send them to the ship with a shuttle to get and bus home, Syrja said to STT.
The Elves fans were following the Olevez and HPK fight, which ended at the 4-3 of Ilve.
According to the Sunday, the harbour resulted in the fact that the water paint of the Ancient Age had about half feet lower than normally.
The Navigation has also been difficult to say that the nearest population mark had been in the sight of defects, so that highlighters did not normally seen in dark reasons.
None of the above-mentioned rupture
Haveri came to the west of the Judean Salm, a little after the shipway was cut by Tampere and Helsinki's eye of motors.
The larger dramatic case has not been involved in Sri Lanka, since the speed of the ship was very low and nor caused a marked rupture of parts of the base.
According to the fact that the detention of the ship has not caused ages and pressures and the rifles of these visions have continued normally.
The slaughter came on the lunch morning to check the ship’s sight before the ship was shocked off.
We are still on the basis of certainty to see that there is no harm to this, Sirh says.
It believes that the following M/S Tampere can be treated in accordance with the next weekend.
The ship's ride period continues, according to him, until the day of self-respect.
No use for ambulances
The Savior Office was held on the case on Sunday night after some half the twenty-five.
The swimming pool was alarmed for ambulances to take evacuated passengers, but the ambulance did not use.
In the late night, the adventurer Matti Willman told that evacuation conditions were difficult because of the dark and a very strong wind.
The Savior Office reported half three days after Sunday on the other night that all of the ships have been evacuated and passengers have been moved to Tampere.
In 1957, the manufactured riders have been formerly established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judiciary slaughter of pain and rupture may remain a higher bond.
Brett Kavanaugh, represented as the highest judge of the United States, may, in particular, remain very worthy of its goal, assessing chairman of the Mika Aaltola of the Ulkopolitical Institutes.
By this time, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual suffering and an inadequate conduct in their school periods.
According to Altoo, the suspicion has brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party, that President Donald Trump can end up to present a office of some other person.
In the United States, soon, the candidate of the President to the Supreme Court has raised a lot of conflicts.
In this case, the judges generally have turned up, reports Aaltola.
That's how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would be to the layer of democratics
The highest right of the United States is to be above policy, but at least in Kavanaugh, the choice of the new judge has become a very clear process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltoa will probably get the Democratic Party's decision in the intervals of the Congress.
It would highlight the vote between youth and women that would likely vote democracy.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge would be a long-term winning for the Republicns.
The status is not part of each presidency, since the Supreme Courts in the United States are appointed to live.
In the use of these substances, some of them have been left on their own application for some 70-80 years of age.
Any part of the Republic of the Africans of the name
The United States's highest courts are also to be made normally, Aaltola states.
Even though Trump has decided to be additional to the FBI only for a week period, it may, according to Aaltola, bring to it something that is essential.
Yeah, it could be.
It's hard to smoke without the fire, says Aaltola.
According to the Balloa, it is at least certain that the office of Kavanaugh's suitability or inconvenience is still being discussed strictly before the senator has decided.
The Republics have a majority of votes 51-49 in the senate, but at least two women's Republicans are suspected of the name of Kavanaugh.
It would be clear that the appointment would be taken to vote and the Republicns would lose.
The woman identified the military reporting officer of Salisbury.
A Russian woman has reported to BBC its general radio company that Salisbury's drought as a Russian suspect of military information services agent.
A woman reported the pictures that there is anatoli Tshepiga, anatoli Tshepiga working in the GRU.
The Net Society of Bellingcats and Russians, Insider of Russia, previously reported about the other drought of suspect men as Tshepiga.
They have already found evidence of the current personality of men.
The BBC group traveled to a village located near Russia and China, where Tshepiga was located.
A young woman who lived in that place identified the pictures of the Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in the pictures of the British police in which Russian Boshirov appeared as a man who is now called.
The Russians are suspected of the angry of Sergei Scripal and his daughter in the Novitshok nerve of March.
The scripts survived in life.
Everste Tshepiga has been paid on the honor mark of Russian hero in 2014.
The Russians still have a doubt of the GRU connection.
The drought men told previously to the Russian TV in September that they had been tourists in Salisbury.
Olders in the war reform
There has now been a living example of what the Cyprus government defined in the practice of the change limit of the war reform.
My National War Services produced a membership of the Oulungare, whose officer is the former Director of Health in 2016.
The Chairman's leaders warn the Delegation of Changes.
If the expenses of war are now increased, the governments of the Community will be locked in the future.
The central officers have swallowed, and most of them are prepared for the major structure change of older care that would stop the organisational treatment and small memorandum unit of the Health Department.
To add home airline treatment, which means the long intervals in the Catalogue that the elders living in disrespectives are just to be treated as "home" in the area of health.
Wait trusted that the group pays the customers to it.
The Vatican Left does not emphasize bad preparation, but has organized a good public situation that has become a lot of owners, neighbors and other parties.
I have presented a war-making process in the form of how to handle older people in the Vatican, which is now the most important part of the northern country.
The shoes were also formed by the neighborhood Carina Western.
The local newspaper made a couple of occasions, and it rebuild the manufacturers of the Oulungarre.
Sovereign manufacturers do not write any papers that the waiting has built a new chain in Vaala, which is now waiting for the poor people.
No other service producers.
The manufacturers are only talking about services, but do not tell what levels of treatment for or any staff structure should be treated by elderly until receiving treatment.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the places of the Department of Health are stopped because there is no doctor’s night-relatedness.
The waiting will also be safeguarded to the doctors of the Vaal Health Centre.
The example of the State is how the central officials are switching on the data of the delegated lack of information and the delegates are put into the walls on the contrary border.
This is how the central partners will slow from the people of the Vaal, because whoever remains insecure to live volunteerly if it is possible to change it.
Was one of the expressions that the whole country was considered to be inhabited?

Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, told her the opposite opinion of Erdogan about Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, murdered, and slaughtered.
For Erdogan, everything that disappears his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage, Erdogan's German Pass in North Rhine-Westfalen is a major part of the population in Turkey.

Rehn account over the end of the European trade: "Twitter to see"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the whole world.
In all Europe, growth has been calculated and the Finnish Bank has reduced its own economic growth budgets.
Director Olli Rehn said in the United States that although the clergy has no direct impact on the European Trade Reports, it deteriorates confidence, which reflects the investment decisions of business.
It also concerns the export of Finnish enterprises.
Rehn believes that Europe is very well-being.
It has been able to build a peace between the United States and, in particular, peaceful situation with China and Japan.
Europeans do not think Rehn seem to be slow to the footsteps of the trade war.
You have to look at the next twitter and evaluate after it.
We have an unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in Yle's debate.
In Europe, it also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest population of the euro area of Italy, which is also one of the most debt countries of the euro area and the world's world.
The markets reacted last night rarely by the Italian government to report a clearly decreased budget.
In the next year, there are more than 2,4 per cent of the population production.
Rehn believes that the Italian situation is worried about it.
Five per cent of the country's weaknesses and unorganized credits are over 10 per cent.
In addition, its public economy is in weak cases and the country seems to be re-excepted in relation to its European partners.
It may not be able to put new crises, Rehn answered when he was asked whether it would take Italy to the European Economic Crisis.
The second thing which is trial to Europe is the Britain's difference between the EU.
Rehn hoped that it's in a friendship.
There would be a lot of more negative effects from a sufficient difference.
Rehn started as the director of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mr Mario Draghi, Director of the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken its task after a year of reciprocity.
His follower's debate has started.
And Rehn and his precepter, Erkki Lika's name, are angry in the talks.
I'm not sure that if the Finnish's name is together, Rehn said and adds that I won't comment on this.

Finnish police drones are the world's higher: "We are in the matter of education."
According to the Director of Police High School, the police may use drones in addition to the loss search for, for example, in criminal studies and intelligence.
The school police has been able to find Raah, using the drone of the lost soul, only in a few minutes.
The president of the Police High School Kimmo Himberg on the twin case and mentioned otherwise that "we are very important to the world with an unreasonable experience and effective education".
Drone's mostly a new invasion, and it's more likely to be a police officer.
There's no statistics about the Finnish police's master's use of the dron.
He said that he has a strong idea that this is.
For example, this has been realized when the Finnish police experience has been reported in international events.
He's very interested in it, Himberg says.
It would be very ridicule visitors to look at the Finnish police's drones operations.
We're asking for education.
Advanced
Himberg recalls that in Finland's winters the shortest possible of finding loss is very important.
As I said, Raahen's case was gone through the dron only in a couple of minutes.
Finnish police has already trained hundreds of drones.
He said they're going to learn more.
The drones are already useful in the police, and their use is generally and increased in the future.
I'd like to tell you, Himberg's telling you.
In addition to the investigation of losses, the police says that he can use drones, for example, in the investigation of accidents or crimes, and in certain information methods.
For example, there must be a little longer area that may be fearable for violence.
Drone can so use for pre-information.

In that way, he appreciates his precedent Joma Olila's leadership.
Ollila was depressed, but in the past Nokia's ability to act as a group of leaders; fear and unreasonableness, which was partly caused the destruction of the telephone movement.
The risk insufficiency and ability of the company had lost.
The week in Helsinki was also organized in the Northern Business Forum, which brought the messenger of the Finnish business life.

I'm going to talk about good leadership.
The leader's leader Gary Hamel said that a good leader should be able to bring a company to the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most assaulted by the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the largest Whele Foods trade chain, said that the director must buy a message to the whole personal company.
And that purpose may not only be an inconvenience for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote introversity of the success book, reported that the most successful leaders of all are humble.
They work peacefully, silently and validly.
Often they're introvertible.
Professor Aswath Damodaran reminded that the proper leader's properties are to be in one way with the lifestyle stage of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the director must share the story that the company is based on the future.
The company growing at the stage needs a leader who knows numbers.
These teachers in Northic Business Forum listened to the Finnish leaders of 7 500 visitors.
They had a risk of information.
A lot of the good directors are required.
The leadership is therefore so often, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasma and Olila.
They were talking between them and friendly.
However, they thought that they were the right leaders to Noah at the right time.
And their humility was not an external easier to evaluate.

Students show a rare snake: Ancient tragedian - feared Oreste affects their visa protection
Ancient tragedies are rare in Finnish shows.
For example, the National Styletter has recently seen the antiquities of Sofokleen Philotetes in 1988.
Now, the Teater High School has been the original round of the National Style, the only sample trilog, Aiskhylox Orestian.
In the beginning of 2015, Lavat opened! in the projects of the Teater High School, students work with the professional student internationally.
This fourth project, as first, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His first-international night, Orestia, came in Berlin in April.
Roihan agrees on Orestians to enhance the destruction of the report on the end of the network of Atreus's family and the birth of the State of justice in an hour of twenty-five minutes, especially by intensifying the sewage parts.
The work is able to be a very faithful Church of Simonzure’s great spiritual finance (2003).
Dramatic lights and theatrical pages highlight a slightly and brilliant displaying.
It has a dynamic between the mortality in the middle of the diagram.
The presentation is used for both, as well as third-party instruments.
The showers have not been removed from the spectacle, so for example, for example, Agamenon, who returns to the Trojan war and this war, are shown by the murders of Kassandra, unlike the antiquity strategies.
The real presentation is not to be faithful to the antiquity strategies.
Moreover, the viewer’s eyes are created a modern, a faithful interpretation of the text, which is constantly informed of its rituals.
Roiha has been able to obtain from the master stage shower students as a group of stakeholders, directly one organism, a group of rhythmics.
In particular, the very extremely explicit group systems that are formed in the western regions are engaged in their rights, only by correcting the white boundaries, showing.
It's a good thing.

A little more than thirty - athletes had eviled three men in the restaurant situated in the center of Jahana and represented him on Sunday morning.
First, a man found a man inside the restaurant, which resulted in his removal of the place.
In the outside, he would shoot another man into the country, and when a third man was missing, he still found him.
The police took the worst guard.
By the police, a man continued to be agressive and shoot the other police feet.

A long line radio driver, Erkki Pálli is dead
Another known as a long-term delivery, Erkki Palli was a 83-year-old cancer.
Radio advisor Erkki Palli, 83, is dead.
He went to improve a payment head that told him on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, this is the expense now.
The doctor has said it, the day alive, he commented on his situation in the Winter months ago.
The security of trade stages and seeds must be granted
I received the first reward in 1984.
In these years, when a matter is surprised, it is usually about the great news.
When I wrote (Chariah, 27.9.) about the insecurity of smaller trade employees, I was surprising and even a bit angry.
I also talked about the workshop of the Services (PAM) Working Association (Eriika Runner).
He says that the crimes don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though the employees, of course, claim otherwise.
Police information is only a clearly tried case, and many of your right violence situation remains not reported.
"The firms have a serious obligation to register statistics nearly, on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain internal and not to collect any information," he said.
Heavy degrees don't end in statistics.
There has always been a problem that does not always generate physical disorders.
Psychical traumas may be much more serious than black and hair, despite this.
The difference between violence situations and threatening violence is difficult when a certain level of aggressive threat to violence must be counted as violence - even though it wasn't.
There are too many fears in their workplace, even though the works aren't happening.
Some inhabited areas are uncomfortable.
The trade has purchased guards.
In the delivery of the open conditions of trade, it was also a large increase in the media of its impact on the security of the sales.
"There were a lot of employees who organized guard services at least at nighttime feelings as well as to prevent single work", said the complaint.
When nothing happens, we're going to make a wrong decision.
This would now appear to be an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the guards remained very controlled, it became a picture that the warning would not be necessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to search for solutions that could be removed by the guard services.
It is an advisory case and it is quite comprehensive that the soldier does not want to investigate the crime which is generally living in the trade.
However, in the same case, in 2011, the excessive badness of the accused will be changed under the accused, if it happens in the workplace.
I think I need cases of precaution now.
When the next time of the trade store, or badly, the police should investigate, and the accused defense should be accused.
When the right to put a few devil complainants into prison, and the sentence from there is a deeply delay, they will be shocked.
The Community, where the food trade must be in small places also open for a few nights, must ensure the safety of the employees.
Heydi Sohlberg was shocked to the Misses before the start of a direct sentence: "Sara, Iiro is married."
Miss's crossing is not seeing a traditional way on TV this year, but a message shows the Viafree page.
The ex-Ms. Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay's father of the NHL and KHL students is Iiro Harjula.
As a backstage and a red dinner, Janni Hussi works.
Before the direct sending, the three-third of the drinker told the visitors and the media’s representatives about the sentence.
First of all, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula dragon apploats.
Now all women smell!
Look at this one of our men's fellowshipers, Sohlberg shocked his colleagues in the gorge of the public.
For overwhelming kitchens, Miss Finland has been following many years.
On the other hand, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sit on the wheel, and Sohlberg slowed in a few directions.
Sarah, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg was shocked by watching Saro back.
What more likely Sohlberg was referring to a disappearing from Sippi, who was smiling to comments, even though it wasn't the first one that seemed to be awesome.
She talked to the first time in the weekend of the night Zonoma magazine.
The missionary told us that he would not want to open different reasons more clearly in public, because it is a matter between him and Roope Salum.
He said he didn't have a challenge in a new relationship, but he wants to concentrate himself.
I focused on my own cases, and especially in my own life, Sarah Sieppi told me.
The Harjula Marriage status was still in the past stage when Sohlberg was wrong to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The triangle was smiling in the shock.
Irohan was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi's bullshit.
The Northern man asked to be entered in his opening body by smoking, smoking and eating a violent grain
In the North, the court has been sentenced for a 34-year-old man in Kokota for three years in prison.
Criminal instrument, otherwise, was shock, cake and narcoticity.
The Court of Justice proposed that the State was lost.
Rank's infringement in the sludge of the rape.

No display of pregnancy
The 34-year-old age was also accused of two degrees of free-related crime and 22 May.
However, these reasons were to be dismissed inevitable.
The meeting was discussed behind the doors closed in the court.
However, the Court of Justice was sentenced to a public statement.
According to the Court of Justice, it was accused of the case of violence, threat and packing in situations where it had been engaged.
It was caused by his victim with water, smoke, eat a strong skin, shooting water, and coffee on this.
The court ordered the criminal instruments lost to the State: cylinders and cakes, fingers, smokes, waters and waters.
Four Witness
According to the rule of law, the parties continued to live between the works.
The Court of Justice is readable that a major part of the most offensive acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
The court heard four Witnesses, two women and two men.
A 34-year-old age must be paid for the repayment of the pain, the slaughter, the suffering, and the temporary detriment of the total of EUR 5800.
Those money are hardly with him, because the sentence has already its old bonds in the heritage.
The prison penalty isn't the first man.
The night isn't telling the name of the judge to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not legally written in this case.

JHL prior to: tomorrow the workshops start to see children’s daily treatment and social and health services
Tomorrow, public and well-being languages of overwork and shift are shown in particular in social and health services as well as in the treatment of children, evaluates the President of JHL's Day of Niemi Law.
The effects will be large, and they will certainly see that staff is not sufficient.
Everyone's got to think about how he's looking for her child.
The employee is now concerned that services play and no spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to the National Law, the decrease of employees also appeared at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in the supermarket and dialysis language because of contract negotiations.
The employees have done through the teams the possibility that the staff has not been paid, but the employees have remained over or changing mountains.
This is not any work.
The standard of work is that every employee is considered to be careful for regular workers and only to do it.
JHL opposes the right of government to enhance the protection of small enterprises.
Mark Ku Jalonen's Employees' Employees' Employees' Employees' s Employee Mark Jalonen did not predict the impact of the survey and quote languages.
However, he does not believe that they are very excited, even though services can be deteriorated.
The employees around Finland are aware of this and have prepared what can be done.
The area is so large, social and health and the technical sector that is difficult to say.
The effects may change a lot of operational, regional and employees, and Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week there have been experiences in other areas of the Super and Social and Health Organization, three days of the Task Force.
The effects were less than time.
JHL's overseas and dialyming language concerns otherwise massacres, churches, states, social and health workers.
For example, family day careers have been limited outside.
In this stage, the work is about almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to the Nome Laine, JHL's actions may be long-term.
The Annex has also been prepared for other workshops if the preparation of the dismissing law is continued.
The government should now admit that this drinks on the wall and hard.
I think it must be against the movement and the government.
It is special that the crowds are already in the shock, although the presentation has not yet been given, then Jalone will be updated.
The great Coral Rhode is born by children and adult power - a presentation in the university of skin and marine snakes.
In the other places, the Great Coralirity was first in Hampur, and the last Sunday, the second time in Finland, this time in the Canneltal.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coralirity is the work that is built from the start until the end of the end is with the public.
However, this time is also a clear spectacular presentation, which makes it clear and grateful for the reviews made in the initial practices.
In the theatrealics, it is sufficient to skin or also to the child-skin analysis test.
The spectrum of the child has already been taken during the preparation of the industry.
However, large coralism is not a childhood, but a presentation for adults and children in cooperation.
It provides for adult information and considerations to take information against children and to do art.
The ability of children to strike into practices and common clothes also supports the slowness between adults and children.
The Great Coralirity also reminds some of the unibalt, angry and creative knowledge, but finally it is covered in other, non-human stages around visitors.
The large coralism begins to recognise corals and animals and fish trafficking on the coral side.
In addition, different specimens are teached in other parts of the shoe and the sea shoes.
Finally, a medium-sized spectrum of a hour, where music, lights, and swimming lands and powders will help to meet the coral flow of life.
In the Great Coral River, there are both soft people who check the life of the coral irrigation and the corals to be examined.
Furthermore, we will be some of the organs to be examined in the coral.
Views and observes in many directions do the presentation of the speech and life.
If there's some body's swimming organism, the country's reviewing body, and the second body, or the skin, and all this is the same time.
It doesn't seem to be hard for the kids.
In other places, the Group is trying to practice a thought and operation limit when the group is composed of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the situation of children makes it more important.
After the workplace, Sitrator will organize a silenced attention for the Hong Kong corals.
The disasters of human understanding should not be depressed, although it could be difficult to understand what is the meaning of being carried out by the more promptly destructive visions.
In other areas, it has built its work so that it respects the diversity of life in the political manner.
There are other generations, there are other knowledge, other species, and their future generations, which are miraculously and pleasant.
I'm happy that my children haven't been smartphones in my child.
Childs and youths today are more inresponsibilities.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time as younger and younger.
I think that the children should be children all the time of their childhood, and they do not raise their lives because they are disappointed and sex, because others say that.
I was shocked when my friend told me that I had to search for her sister who was on the fifth quarter at the fifth weekend of the "fife".
When he came to get his humble sister, he told me about his sex in that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned all our childhood that the wrongdoers should not be involved and sex is the case of adults.
I hope that the children today could live in an ambitious child, and they would not need to be born too early because of the group pressure of friends.
I continue to see in Instagram even more young girls that are pictured in the skin and revealed clothes on the top.
Snapchat is used to take and send pictures of the night.
The girls are more difficult to see how old they are.
The 13-year-olds today can easily appear from 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was built in the forest playing and playing swimming games.
I'm glad that my child had no smartphones.
I had been a child for many years, and I didn't need to think what others think about me.
Over: The authorities told the State Guide that the case of Ariston Helmi is not involved in national security
According to the Middle East Kanervan, your protective police and defence forces have been informed by the Defence and Foreign Committee last week.
The Finnish State Guide has been told that Ariston Helmen is not involved in national security, but in organized crime, newspapers Yle.
The information of the sources on the name has been confirmed by the President of the General Defence Committee on Defence (kok).
According to Canerva, the Defence Forces and Protection Police have been reported in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees on the investigation.
This is mainly considered as an economic criminality.
They were particularly strict of not showing that there was another thing, Kanerva commented on Yle in the debate.
According to the general information, there has been no evidence for the sub-scale materials to connect national security, but the investigation is at the same time.
We can't even know what can be revealed from it, a Ule debating report.
A week ago in Turu's vessel and swimming households have risen on the question whether it is investigating the only economic criminality or threatening Finland's internal security.
The aircraft has been tested before this week in which the claims are being conducted as well as against.
Video: A dream saved a series that was killed by Liverpool
Liverpool's 100 percentage Valoliiga started to decide, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1-folding team at Stamford Bridge.
The Sunday will be one year after Manchester City arrived to Stamford Bridge and flee to 1-0.
Then the combination of Pep Guardio sent the whole signal that the city was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last time's over.
And surely the manager of Liverpool, Jürgen Klopp, arrived in the same ideal area in Western London.
The Reds were launched by the sixth original Varioliga winning.
Liverpool began more stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk felt to dominate only his own field end.
Chelsea had a great Ligacup visitor from Anfield Road in the middle of the week.
Then Eden Hazard came from the alternative to solve the fight with a great personal protection.
Now, of course, Hazard was immediately with the beginning.
25 minutes ago, he was first in a small state with the third game Matheo Kovacin and Jorginho.
Finally, Croatit saw the snake of Hazard and sent to this completely weighted transit.
Hazard was thinking of a little punishment on the floor of the area, but from there he bombed a perfect left path to the back of the water.
Pool brassman Alisson was a little slow in his battle, and he didn't get like a shock on his head.
Klopp certainly felt that the killer was slowly unjust, because almost immediately by Antonio Rüdiger put Mo Salahi's driving control power.
In the second section, the Chelsea soldier Kepa came to the reality.
The Basket War reacts rapidly to the Sadio Manén shop and he worked a ball ball as a round pocket.
On the other hand, Alisson was shocked through Hazard.
The best place of the visits was 72 minutes after James Milner found in the center of Bobby Firmino.
However, the shooter of the brassuit was on the top of David Luizia, who saved the leadership of the fathers.
It wasn't on 89 minutes, when the alternator Daniel Sturridge went free to shoot 25 meters away.
Sturridge played with his old home division, and the attacker shocked it as an honourable water over.
Liverpool's 100% link started with a decision on the 1-1 chair, but it's still in the liga box, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also slowly joining two points behind the hands.
Powers are deep in the clock transmission debate
I remember some decades ago, a newspaper asked for different Finnish influencers what shares the Finnish people.
Juice Leskise's answer was the only thought: Nen-head.
Some of the names have no-heads and some aren't.
The team can spend where it's just where it's, and this was one offerer.
In the EU, Finland has been able to delay the annual tightening report.
Many of them agree that clock transfer two times a year has been driving and caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement seems at least the easier stage of the solution in Finland, unless it has been easy.
The difficulty is now to solve what time ends at the end of the clock is: the current summer or winter or some other clock cycles.
This will also be allowed to tell the people their opinions to take on the page.fi.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communication, and it is open to Friday 12 October.
The debate is being expressed in the coffee and social media, and everyone has his word to say.
The temporary defence is based on their side by the effects of the sun’s sunlight on people’s welfare and sustainability, by the effects of the night’s outdoors and through the welfare of people.
Both of these aspects have old supporters and good reasons.
The investigations also reported that the morning-free movement will take human day and give a delegation.
On the other hand, if you don't want to suffer in darkness, increase the light of people move out and give better opportunities to skins, for example.
The amount of the addendum has already been calculated after normal working day.
I would think both of us, but we're not going to be able to be in the northern school of the earth.
The fields are too dark and are too light to many in each case.
The typical discussion on the subject is that the opinion of one’s own views and the other views are very slightly opposed.
The reasons of the counterparty are not just listening, because the main thing is what it feels.
Since almost all of us find the opinion about it, it is a tricky to try to turn another head.
There's a smell back to the smell.
The issue is very easy to say, because this is not required to be large and fundamental to meet each other.
Of course, the typical matters are more thrilling and unfruitablely.
Let me consider it if the wrong option is chosen, but it would not be appropriate.
And it is always offering a suitable sinner if life feels awake.
Josba struggled this visitor.
Josban's first visitor player in the Salbband Divar produced three series of points against Solomon Jymy.
Josba went from the Sienego home to the 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) winning together.
On the other hand, Joshua was on the start of a third, but Joshua was looking for compositions and rounded men in the kitchen.
In time, 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtinimi were drinking to 6-5-fold.
Two teams were played in a reliable minute in the balance.
Josban effectively was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The two chain was a fired change, even when the Teemu Tmahen (1+1), Jere Carristic (1+0) and Jere Ketune (1+0) also shared.
Miika Kosonenk (1+0) played on birthday also in two chains.
It's six points after a three-shirt round.
The next one will come to the O2-Director in two weeks after visits.
On Sunday, 200-year-old celebrations
The 200-year-old celebration of the Church will be carried out tomorrow Sunday in very painful tunnels.
The destruction of the church's slaughter has been shocked a week ago.
I was also guarded by the church on two nights after the ball.
Even though it's hard to worry today, it's still a party place.
Although no one would like that, the church of Eno is now the elderly church of the congregation of Joensu.
The church in the Mediterranean village has always been the heart of the world's nation and other commitments, despite all.
The family starts at the Eno Church tonight 10:00.
Then, it will be moved to the congregation’s chairmanship.
The program has a long day of all kinds of inside as well as outside.
For example, a church building may be able to meet those who remains alive, as a master of the congregation for 37 years.
The Church’s birthday also means the end of a period.
The congregation hall, built in 1982, has opened its door the last time today.
Now we're in the former community hall, the capital Markk of Homes.
The congregation has destroyed internal problems, but the church has been a healthy place for that 200 years.

Political phone numbers for years in Britain's hands of shocks
Many British politicians were angry when their contact information was published in the secretation because of the lack of persons.
The torments have been handed on the phone numbers of the Ministers.
This was an application for the Deputy Party of the British Conservation Committee in the Government.
For example, the Brexit, Minister of Environment, Restaurant and Rural, Michael Gove, as well as the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, had become a challenge.
Many civilians got an interference.

The United States's rapidly broadcasting format The Wall was cut into the Finnish version last Sunday to Nelos.
Everybody as Paaso's pause game show is described in Poland in the same studio in which I formed other international productions.
In the pool study, the possibilities of description were exceptional, since I formed a large size of 12 meters high swimming swimming demands the conditional space.
During the initial period, a programme study firm was slowed in half-term.
In Twitter, you would have a discussion about whether people understand how the people are sit in the studio as part of the Finnish to play anything.
Onne Sormune, Head of Home Programmes of Quarters, is a light for the Middle East.
He tells that the studio community has close to the players, other Finnishers, foreign somalists in Poland as well as well as side viewers.
The Commonwealth consists of international contacters in the Finnish production, as well as the public of the Wall periods described in the same state of production.
In Finnish there are such squads, such as professionals that are used in different programs, the Sormune declares.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so difficult, although it would not understand the language to play it.
Red and green balls from the wall are easy to separate each other.
However, the visiting language studys are placed on the location of records that handle the translation.
There are two instruments that are covered as a simultaneous census for the studio operator.
And then the studio manager will guide the public and tell you what keyboards there are, for example, to cut down and what the situation is going on, Sormune says.
He compares the situation with David Hassejoph and his home production.

My sky's skin on the end
You've been bad at the beginning of your last year.
My shock was already shocked when the team lost the Sunday by reading the Vasa Sport 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The portals now have five floors of death, and the points of six surroundings are in the castle two.
One of the defenders of Ethia or two lower kitchen players has not yet done the country.
The loss will also grow all the time.
A lot of sports against the public has already been depressed in the stage when the game was a lot of half of the rest.
The six games are just played, and of course there's no reason to stop.
I'm worried about it, because we're weakly saving it.
In particular, one of the other was a bad exhibition that was to disappear, 1+2 did Jarno Kärki told.
The winning for sports, of course, was shocked.
There was a game under the breakfast, so I thought it would have been a visible thing.
Maybe it was, but there's no part of the matter.
The number of feeddays continued to grow
The mother of the lady day Pirko's good wonders the number of events that you look at.
Someone thinked that this year may not be such a lot of people, a good morning.
In the course of 2017, the SM MP competitives of Tractorship were organized at the same time, so the expectations should be that the overall amount could even be calculated for the previous age.
In other words, however, the supporters were already slowly used before ten, solders told the end of the products, the newspapers had been sold over 500 doses, and the number of cars had even been good to increase.
The estimate has been about 6000, the good news is later on the evening.

In the series of children, Teja Kiviniemen's beautiful bread wins a public vote.
11 different forms of bread.
The winner of the wheelchair Marjata Vetzalena passed a day in the corner of the mart.
7 x beautiful light - this you recognize the good lamb
Leave the state of life, create the right tunnel and read the book without disappointment.
Good light supports the snake.
We'd take together three good reasons for putting on light.
Vinkit gave Innolux to Trade and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do services to your eyes
The significance of the light increases the more older years behind.
Sustainable light can help many who will be late when the vision’s verification is decreased and wedding is still more suffering.
Mothers also need to increase light.
The six-year-old one needs light three times more than two-year-old.
Thus, the handling effects of the light and the quality of the light are supported by healthy reasons.
I'm good to give the light sufficiently, but you're not marrying, something's wrong.
Create beautifulness around you
Beautiful insight can only be aware of the right light solutions.
This moment, the sister's got a choice.
The recommendation has a Japanese style that combines the unleavened, scandinacy and japanese diversity.
On the other hand, from the 70s, the modern and playing retrotyl has also increased from the bleeding of color, metal with different darkness or refrigerator colors until the tree.
Reality is in the same way as at home in other parts.
The materials are now seeing trees, betons, cheramics, papers, skins, and bamboo.
Look at your personality.
Homes are now put into place more than previously, and it has become a way of expressing themselves.
Instead of making a landscape, it is desired to have a detection, a courageous light that has a story to tell.
People are clearly demanding Finnish and Northern products with origin and planners.
So we're very designing computers. It's what's going on.
The home is not necessarily obtaining a new trendication, but an unplanned classic for many years.
Some unfair, defensive and elegant classics like their painting from the year to another, I say.
Thank you for seeing it!
It showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of Brendan O'Donnell are shocked.

All of us's coming packages will go to new use.
We can use boxes ten times as long as the package has been able to use it, Ville Puurula Oulu's Game tells us.
The material as a company uses the newspapers and other relevant rounding materials.
The smuggles are guarded as long as it is possible.
In the past few years, we have to move in the board even to the rounding material.
Move wants to show an example to others.
The shifting is not a cause of excessive difficulties.
There's no big problem that starts to turn around.
It will also be economic expenditure when, for example, ill packs are used for new.
The processing of the Gameer is incredible, as the main product selection of the movement is part of the games and devices used in other parts.
Each modeling purchase: one and the same way is operating at each stage
The classic clothing works for a second stage than in the stage.
They are creating a multi-use basis on the foundation of a good garderob, as it is easy to collect different places on the roots.
The mixture of the clothes used by the clothing cake is loaded by the nails.
This category also belongs to black pool.
The black neighbors produced in the pools can not be a mistake.
The clothing can be combined with the right skin, the skin as well as the skin, and it can be created around the swimming area and the swimming style.
The poolonella agrees to the young modern slaughter as well as to the classic pleasant kitchen.
I saw you trusted the guy.
The cyxy trendilook is born from skins and wide stainless skins, black pools and wet nickles.
A classical polyne together with other classic, green skot rose and wine loafers, form a woman’s and beautiful habitat.
It is a black smell smell, combined with the swimming vessels of the skin: the shoes, the high skins, and the sweet smells.
Young and sweet!

The smoke is coming to Turkey to follow the choice of the Siriaan Cyprus
Inlandsminister Hai Mykqueen (together close to Turkey to follow the choice of Finnish cities.
Finnish has been decided to take this year from the 530 Czech Republic of Turk flights.
The elections are generally made a couple of times in the year, together with representatives of the Migration Office, the Ministry of Labour and Human Rights, as well as the police.
The Government has already been the best debate in Turkey.
The United Nations Refugee Organization will first choose people in a special delicate position.
It was intended to use people who are viewed to be a special emergency situation in refugees, such as single career, hair and sickness, women and children.
In the future of the Finnish group, more people are selected than in the coast, as a part of the practice remains unacceptable to different reasons.
It is also a visit to citizens organizations operating on the border of the Turkish internal minister, Süleyman Soyl, and Syria.
The route is also together with the Chief of the National Minister of Internal Affairs.
Referring to the Community
Finnish has been taken from the 1970s.
In the past few years, the kitchen has been 750 volunteers in the year.
The quote was for a couple of years in the year 1,050, but the government has therefore not been born in the government.
The whole committee has encouraged the expansion of the quota, but the project has finally fallen in the contrary to the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipila (cesk.) recently presented a number of 1,500 to 2,000 people in the year.
In this period of government, the first minister of Internal Affairs is to follow the election of cities.
Pre-Ministers Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risccio (soc.) were to move their new tasks before the visitors were organized.
Finnish supports EUR 10 000 from the EU to each of the voluntary situation.
Now, let's go to the shop. We don't know if we're crying or smiling.
The Karyan news was last Sunday on the legislation to change animal protection.
Article concluded that the legislation was subject to the provision of animals, animals or other business activities which are associated with the conservation of all animals not permitted by the provisions of the Ministers.
As a result, all other animals in the Regulation have been prohibited prosecutively, except for different animals.
If the law ends, it means that we are abandoned in the Western Democracy in general principles that the laws are prohibited in different ways to risk social security or good ways.
It is now prompted to prohibit all the operations of which the law or regulation is not permitted to be granted.
The amendment causes that nothing new can be experienced, for example, in enterprises and not do anything else before its accepting law or regulation.
The government's activity has usually been weak.
If we now go to that so that in Finland all are prohibited, which has not been allowed to be, we do not know whether we are smiling or smiling.
I don't doubt if the animal protection law does not require updates.
But this law project does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I don't know the Constitution very well, but if it is possible to accept the "to all that is prohibited in the laws or in the regulations to allow" procedure.
I hope that a reasonable minister will find that delays the expansion of such a law project.

Status symbols do not touch friends - four factors from the recommendation
What makes a favorite, carristic or mentality from humans?
Scientists of Sydney University analyzed two slightly different dimensions of "coolity": generally detrimental cohesion and, in this case, mutual partnership.
Many of the researchers had a description of many socially hoped aspects: they were outlined, friendly, sophisticated and skilled.
Another one of the other advisers was the type of illness, self-respect, corruption and smell.
They shared experiences and had just a few outdoor assessments.
You know, the youngest guys have a good selfishness and a stable life of feelings.
The role of the deep is no longer cool: high status in the age of the age is not necessarily leading to success in the past life.
This reported in Child Development Journal of the United States, published in 2014.
Young people who were talking early, shuttled, shocked to the good and tried to encourage others, had increased the risk of using complaints and thinking of crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they worked more weak than in the time of their age as well as inconsistent.
High status communicates shoes, signs, or balls do not make human cools - or at least swimming follow-up.
