European inflation was disrupted in food
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, should first be the higher growth of the food price.
The increase of prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering – after 2.6 per cent of October – an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent – announced the Union Statistics Office with seats in Luxembourg.
Official predictions were only as probably 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (BCE), unlike the North American, British and Canadian employer banks, did not cut the basic interest, I know that decreasing, along with the prices in increased primary materials and the reduction of forced party, would cause inflation espiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is on tramp 22: "I have to negotiate" on inflation so that it should not be involved in this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, slaughtered the record of 12 years, while in Spain increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was disappeared in the euro area as a result of food and energy prices.
The quotes in terms of the trigo increased in a 88% and also the soja quotation has reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, there was much more paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year in a 52 percent, reaching the black gold almost $100 in the last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will spend from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, instead of 2009 will be decreased to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce the type of interest in 2008 two times.
Gallup prescribes a government crisis
After a long stretching, the support of the Youth Democrats Alliance was significantly increased, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while Gallup has never experienced a very low level - a 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the safe electors of the parties, due to the most strongness of the opposition electors, would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against support of a fifth part for socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach any limit to have a parliamentary scale: their support within the entire population is of two percent.
Among the safe electors, there are more than one percent of sympathising in both baths.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who have seen particularly badly the country's economic situation, as another 46 per cent believes that the situation is very bad.
The families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pesimists about the change of their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, most people have the deterioration of the situation, and only a tenth part is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, above any previous survey in Gallup, estimated that the President of the Government was more well performed as well as its functions.
13 percent of the consultations trusted or trusted in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Victor Orban supported 38 percent of the consultors.
54 per cent of the population did not believe absolutely in the Head of Government, and 27 per cent is not trusted in the President of the Democratic Alliance of the Youth.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the experienced discount against the person of the Head of the Government without a change of government.
While after the disorders of October last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (a 33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of the surveys in the question on the participation answered that it would be safely involved and another 20 per cent said that it was likely to be involved.
Comparedly, in "a general election to celebrate this Sunday" only one 55 percent of the population, and another 15 percent probably believes their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electors are not doubtful of the result of the popular consultation.
An 74 per cent of the population would defeat the payment of research rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation services, and 84 per cent of the hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions only between the safe participants in the reference, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would reject the introduction of studies rights, the payment of medical consultations and the hospital attention.
The most precious is the Samaan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
The average increase in the price level of a 16 percent the hypermarkets of Budaers' gold triangle were maintained, with the difference that this year has not been increased by the VAT.
Article of Gazdaság
This year also increased in a average of 16 per cent in the Budaers' gold-commerce triangle the normal boat canadian of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growing higher than thousand HUF.
As in December of the last year the prices in the supermarkets were already "dispared", there was no drastic decline in comparison with the high level of partition.
However, it is obviously agricultor for consumers that what the last year had been able to buy a price very below the nine thousand HUF today, nor for ten thousand.
The Napi canstate in the hypermarks studied exceededed at least 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value canasta was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003, that canasta costed 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum and fishing licor remained almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase in the swimming powder, cloud and snake was registered.
The price of the dry and pane roof followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the product price at least 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the Coca-Cola price of two litre bottle costed less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the bottle price, costed only 257 HUF.
However, in the skin of Napi was also the face as the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, with regard to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased with a 15th, as Tesco and also with about 18 percent the prices contained in the chansta of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most cherished canasta in the last year with the cheapest canasta of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest and the facest of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during the last year's Christmas on prices was the increase in VAT.
Only this process was the detriment of the trade, the supermarkets were visiblely not able to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the consumption price change.
(If the commerciant plans badly the speed of circulation of a product, it may lose a significant benefit in the margin that is adapted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi canasta has reached such extremes as a result of the increase in the VAT, which was the most higher than 1720 HUF to the value registered in 2006, while the difference was just 844 HUF.
This year has not occurred such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest year also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing two schedules, a catastrophic growth in prices was registered in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets increased over 30 percent of the price of the first-needed consumption items.
(But this does not necessarily confirm the numbers of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some foods of first need, has registered a price increase of more than 30 percent within 12 months.
For example, in addition to the egg, in the case of the egg.)
According to the Napi Canasta, in this last case, this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that has been quite precious in the past year compared to the base, only 10 percent of price increase was registered in the worst cases.
According to all indexes, the tiny suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, and could impos the dramatic increase of prices even to multinationals.
Hyper-markets do not remain in the gold-commerce triangle, they are constantly talking of positive results.
According to our experiences collected, most of the consumers of the three seats are no longer interested in prices.
All products purchase large amounts, bringing food conservated by palettes.
On Thursday morning, in the three shops, there were large balls before the boxes because he suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that the sales volumes are less, and many multinationals are required to investigate because the income remains below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the electronics.
In many hospitals, defects
This year in hospitals has been registered several thousands of infections first by the indebible application of antibiotics.
The situations of rhetoric hygiene in hospitals, bed harassment and staff overload do not promote infection control - states that the Head of Medical Division of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, even defects are shocked.
Not much ago has been diagnosed with MRSA in the Hospital Yanos Traumatology Department.
In an hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of county occurred in this hospital at the beginning of the year.
The same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of the contact with MRSA, and since then there was no significant surgical intervention for the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December of this year have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multiresident agents - said Karolina Böröcz, Head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that all hospitals with security have been recorded this amount of infections produced by multiresident agents, the rest has no information.
About two third parts of infections (683 cases) should be MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus areus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilin.
A third of human beings take the bacteria of Staphylococcus areus (SA) in their nest without causeing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., gargant inflamation, amigdalitis, cutaneous infections, wound infections) are well reacting to antibiotics and are easy treatment.
However, as excessive or inappropriately applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed in very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and quickly contain in inadequate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as wounds or septicemia infections in first place to patients with transitional or chronic immunity, patients with deficit body, elderly or less weight.
In view of the hospital director Yanos, there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are cotidian in hospitals.
It should not be confunded with epidemic infection, MRSA is only outstanding - said Tibor Nyulasi - where your presence is not reviewed.
Force to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff acts with them in gorge and mask and are adequate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to check the MRSA’s presence in their body, but it is not even possible to avoid infection in all cases.
You're not in mode to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however, the current national hospital conditions do not promote training and contact with multiresident pathogen agents - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is essentially produced in older hospitals and homes, hospitals should investigate hospitalized patients and immediately isolate nurses in their body.
However, in Hungary hospitals there is no moderate use of microbiological samples.
This should also be said that the National Health Case does not finance these medical reviews.
So most of the cases come to public light when the MRSA’s visible infections in the patient are already produced - said the physician-yeph department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union strictly recommends the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national guidelines for the treatment of patholic infections and tables.
Therapy with antibiotics should be directed, or microbiological reviews should be made to prevent the resistance against medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The use of microbiological samples is still less frequent in the case of ambulant or basic assistance patients - said Karolina Böröcz.
Defects are shocked
Scientific experiences have demonstrated that, in most cases, MRSA has been counted from one patient to another through health personnel.
Thus, they play a very important role in the lavage of hands, the use of legs and mass mass, but in this regard also experience significant losses in hospitals.
The MRSA is counted through boards and the direct contact between people, however, in national hospital conditions is not always possible to isolate the counted patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often swimming, beds are often very together, although to prevent epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, there are few nurses and many patients who are more likely to be infected in the hospitals of less favourable economic situations.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are complemented, less infections of this type are recorded or the contagio of the pathogen agent can be stopped.
Governing Programme against MRSA
The treatment of contact with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Heart Safety Fund, so that in all countries it is fighting against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
According to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decrease trend in England.
The European Heart Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multiresident agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infections to these pathogenic agents.
Competing the control of the police commander's alcoholism that caused a dead accident
The periodic official report on the case of the death accident caused by the commander of the 21I district of police.
It can be excluded of the possibility that it leads to ebrio or in acursive state since then by the commander of the police of the 21I district, who was atropelled and caused the death of a transferer, and informed the Vienna Attila Morvai, portal of the General Office of Capital, after preparing the periodic report on the case.
The periodic report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former commander of the police did not consume alcohol before he was taken behind the flight.
The Chief of the Police Office of the District XXII, the March with his special vehicle, doubled the Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII district, a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the named area for peatones.
(The last fact, i.e., that the peaton did not use the cebble to cross the road, according to the rules of the Transit Code, it is not aware of circumstances, the driver must always stop the step in double.)
The transhuman lost his life after he was hospitalized.
The police leader of the district was dismissed and requested his jubilation, according to the police communication, because it was a lot of the case.
The investigation of the case is charged by the Budapest Investigation Monitor.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander had worked with the investigation officers.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Minister of Finance Yanos Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI) Marta Gajecka signed Tuesday in Budapest three cross-border credit agreements for a total of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (BEI) adopted in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the Hungary Environmental Transport and Protection Projects, which will be undertaken by the subsidiary of cohesion funds, which previously had signed a credit contract for a value of 100 million, the contract that finally signed is the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB adopted a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, the decision later will be taken when extending the credit contract will be extended.
The parties signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovations, which will mainly use the budget for the project of innovation and research from the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations, the theme of the construction of the fourth metro line was also broken.
It was agreed that for the end of Hungary with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro will return to the theme if it is necessary or not to change the original contract and how to do it.
According to Yanos Vies, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary by 8.4 billion euros.
The interest of credits is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB provides a grace period of eight years without engaged in maintaining the debt credit.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed to that recent Balkan country.
What, where and those who purchase in the EU's market will soon be carried out?
Analysis of the Bulletin Division of Re/Max.
The preferential goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is certainly any Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the ski pistas and the chalet of the beaches.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favorite regions, while in the Albena Beachs the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are looking for immobile people in the area of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, later or early the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will develop the interest of real estate promotors and more people will buy immobile in Russia's particularly cheap area.
In the same way, the Soviet capital may be attractive, trade spaces and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most paradise attractives of golf in Europe, so it could also be a destiny destination during the other two stations, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, precauted investors are already doing their purchase, for example in the area of Bansko.
In view of analists, who purchase immune in Bulgaria, they are also struggled to change their life and life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more than Romania.
The Maltese and Chipre Promotors are also present and traditionally many Russian customers are on the Black Sea Beachs and the paradise.
Foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to be installed here buy new or renewed prices between 50 and 100 000 euros or old houses in bad state between 5 to 15 000 euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access to them, as well as the nearness of a large city, the shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of chalet purchasers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 vacational destinations of the Germans).
The third group constitutes the real estate investors that make their purchase with the hope of benefiting in a medium or long term.
The price of capital immigrants will continue to grow, since demand is increasing.
Although the European Union has the lower real estate prices, in the past five years, these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of immobile prices is significantly exceeding payments.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungary
According to the Minister for Environment and Hydrology of Gábor Fodor, meetings at the level of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and Thursday after official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
The experts and political experts from 192 countries of the world are discussing on the Bahri Road Day, which provides afterward efforts to the period of reduction of emissions established in the Kyoto Protocol, coming until 2012.
There are currently encouraging discussions on the particular part of developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the time it does not want to negotiate specific figures, although it is intended to reach the agreement that, compared to the 1990 situation, until 2020, it reduces 25 to 40 per cent of the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect.
Another important issue of the Conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, they are or not willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement on aid was made to provide developing countries.
The Support Fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by a 16-member direction council, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role of safeguarding in the global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister declared that the EU was committed to reduce until 2020, in relation to the 1990 level, in a 20 percent of its gas emissions, responsible for the winter effect, independently whether it would be signed or not, and is willing to reduce 30 percent even if other large regions in the world and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacity.
Gabor Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 were forced to decrease at 5,2 per cent, whereas 15 EU Member States were commitmented to comply with a 8 per cent of reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect for the period from 1985 to 87, which our country will comply with - notes the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
It is much that we are playing in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because, if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be placed after 2012. In this case, the reducing commitments taken in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international system for emission reduction, whose need was warned in its recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the United Nations that is under the climate change, which obtained the Nobel Premium of Peace.
Thus, emission reduction would suffer a delay and could not be prevented by an increase in more than 2C of the average temperature of the earth, since scientists would have unconventionable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recluted in YouTube
The United States army units in a video distributor publish records on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) was the use of YouTube services: the special units moved in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on its actions against the Taliban – informed the BBC.
These records made with mini cameras mounted on castles are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
The records from the air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "canal" have already been seen by over 750,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "the headquarters" and publish videos of actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the United Nations Communities (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had loaded the videos with recluding targets, but in view of the Defence Ministry, they also serve to submit to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army outside.
This kind of propaganda is almost nothing in comparison with conventional recluding television spots - declared to BBC the expert in defence Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitablely have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being military action decided by the Government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army also concerns the fact that, in addition to the severely edited and censured records, the distributor also appears affected videos, for example on the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrite, officials speak as the maximum losses, but without presenting the bloody part of the fights.
Furthermore, the Iraqi and Afghanistan fighting fields have already been loaded on the Internet many videos recorded in real operations, but the British army has only been using this opportunity.
Americans use a little different way for the recluding with fire games, freely downloaded, called American's Army, where the player can be put directly in place of soldiers in a more or less real situation.
Tombola and pastel salted on the Birthday Festival of the Ministry
It doesn't seem very sensitive to the Minister of Work, Monika Lamperth: instead of the shipping party, you will celebrate a work meeting for your colleagues who can escape the year 2007 with salad and coffee shoes.

He's going to gather the forces of the wheat
The Sindicates of Liga and the National Labour Commission Federation will form on Wednesday a chair commission to coordinate the moon's lunar which will continue indefinite time.
Thursday, a mix of protest will be celebrated, while the Monday - day of the final vote on public health law will be started.
With all security this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since the train trail will be completely stopped and up to 13 hours will also be employed by the workers of the Budapest Collection Transport Company.
On Monday afternoon, the Liga Unions shall inform about the details of their lunar chairs that will celebrate together with the National Committees Federation.
The LIGA and the National Engineering Union will also be the committee to coordinate Monday's actions.
The Saturday will celebrate a mix of protest, while the Monday participating trades will be expressed in undefinite time, if no agreement with the Government is reached.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law, they have not informed the date of the end of the starting chain.
If the National Assembly declares public health law, the trade unions will immediately retire its call to the chair.
Instead, if the law is adopted, the chair commissions will be gathered and decided on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only it is voted on public health law in the very night-related hours, or at the best closest of the midnight.
As a result of the moon starting, it will be necessary to face significant difficulties in transport: in the railways it will be left to work indefinitely, the morning may seem to be part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the interurban transport of buses from Volan companies.
Similarly, in numerous points of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Many civil organizations and organizations have been joined to the chair, and their names are constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some syndicates announced their strike for indefinite time, others for a defined time.
By Thursday, Ferrocarril State and the Free Syndicat of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement or even on minimum services, but by approaching the Christmas Festivals, more people traveling on trains.
According to information received to this day, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collection Transport Company will be in a chairmanship with the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m., the LIGA Sindicates of Electric Industry and Technical Energy will celebrate a chair of 4 hours from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be expressed in national hour in alternative hours and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which are part of the Sindical Cooperation Forum, will celebrate a warning chain of two hours.
The most important of the four requests made by the Liga is that the Government removes its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second request is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force the year coming.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, the possibility of the occupation that it deserves in the system is possible for advanced pensions.
The fourth reason for the shipment is that the Free Union of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) which is part of the Liga Unions, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on Railways and expect another proposal.
Political Capital [b1]: In the country, Hungarian Garden risks are increased
According to the Office of Risgos Analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of the Hungarian Political Watch Tower, which was established in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Middle Eastern Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
The "risk warning" of the company writes: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guardia, the greatest political risk is the fact that "the aggregation of existing ethnic tensions between the Gymanian population and the non-Hungarian, even in short terms, can cause violent ethnical conflicts".
The main reason for this is that the policy strategy of the Hungary Guardian is probably the cause of this event - accompanied the representative of the investigation institute.
They stated that all of this should be one of the main failures of Hungary political protagonists: "The protagonists of the public life have held him the public debate of the Giganian issue to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, which could have founded their political strategy on existing disregards between giant and Hungary."
This increases the problem, impossable to normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violence conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the investigation institute, the activities of the National Watch Tower, due to the great attention of the national and international media, "deteriored significantly the picture of Hungary in the outside, especially in terms of stability and democratic development of the country".
They recalled us that from August 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups has been increasingly advertising and that since the summer 2007 has been established in the country of numerous organizations that are self-determined by "national self-defence associations".
"The common race of these groups is that they are self-determined as civil organizations, while proclaiming openly the training of their members for the defence - including armed - (defence of civil, national defence, public order), by engaged in the incompliances of the police, the army, namely the State" - aggressively.
They stated: All of this is produced in accordance with the method that is trying to give it a civil presentation to various political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with political and political parties.
It is possible to highlight the civilian and the form of association in the case of these associations not only to avoid legal issues of registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, Hungarian Guardia is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
"In the past months, in many neighbouring States, Hungary Watch was a potential danger, while the ultranationalist figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Human policy with the creation of the Hungary Guardia,
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the investigation institute, the Constitution of the Hungary Guardia is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and Eastern Europe, so that all the regions have increased political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guardian works in similar ways, for example, the Belgian National Watch Tower, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Belgian National Union of extreme right (UNB).
The Constitution of the Bulgar guards shall be the massive disorders of the Giganians that occurred in one of the Sofya barriers (Polian Krasna).
By using this situation, UNB decided to constitute guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
In his view, in the past 17 years there was "terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained imposing and unfair towards the facts - remembering the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has caused an encouraging discussion in the bulgar public view.
As stated, the increase in the risk of ethnical conflicts that certain Gymnasium organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guard.
As Hungarian Watch has even shown similarity with the Burgarian National Watch, there is no possibility to exclude that Hungarians react to the threat in similar ways, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning of the Political Capital's risks.
The Director of Political Capital Investigation, Attila Juhász at the question of the News Agency, stated: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the investigation institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect the change of the risk, they informe the public view, as in that case, by publishing their warning on the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already been converted into a generalized practice that is around the festival days - that the year that will be less - the working days will be reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are one-time festivals.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national festivals, state feasts and festivals.
The festivals are fundamentally related to religious and historical celebrations.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, as well as the first day of the new year is celebratory - this last about everything that they can relax those who pass on the old year.
For the whole year, we have 11 feasts written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national celebration on March 15, 1848, and on 23 October, a reminder of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the work party, on 1 and 2 November, we recall our families and friends failed.
Furthermore, in our country, the Resurrection Passah, the Pentecosty and Christmas are celebrations.
According to the calendar, our state feasts, national or religious feasts are little times matching a weekend, so it is often pushing when before or after the party there is a single working day.
In change of the expanded weekends, during the previous Saturdays, it cannot be exempted from work or school.
It is the minister of work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly on change of the day before or after the party.
This legal standard is of obligatory compliance for all patterns and their employees, as well as for public employees and officials.
It is not binding for companies and services that, due to their role, work uninterruptly even during the festivals.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the events of the end of the year: from 24 December practically the life in the country is stopped, since, according to experiences, the majority of people "face pump" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our festivals will match with medium or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be amended around the work party so that, for four days later, workers can relax.
On Saturday, April 26, will be working day, so that in change, on Thursday 2 May, a feast day.
Another change relates to the celebration of October 23: Saturday 18 October, it will be to work instead of Thursday 24.
Instead, the year that comes during the end of the year can be relaxed, as from 24 December does not work in almost any part, nor even if the last day of the year is a midday.
It's six unsubsidiaries to strike your colleagues' life.
E-mails that we forgot to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass us without giving us account: they all form a part of our Folklore in the work.
It must be decided if you are adapted to the small smells, or you are conscious of the confused situations that may be irritated to others.
Councils.
I'm sorry, I'm forgotten to warn you they've been looking for you from the marketing Department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a quote?
In the best cases it feels and try to repair the matter, the best calls for the marketing Department to tell them that the message was forgotten to deliver you (this is the less ordinary solution).
In most times, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before going to boxes, it is important to meditate in the things with which you can strive the life of your colleagues and strive consciously to avoid them.
Do you still give something that isn't yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to cover a document, a useful office or your phone, and you don't find them.
Do you remember that last night you put the snake on the table, but for this morning it's gone?
Do you even find your balls lost in the table of one of your colleagues?
You don't shout anything to your colleagues without asking them, because in reason they will be sweared to you for your things.
Do not spend over or post-it from the office because you can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and get off before the time.
Cysms about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop laughing that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Do not pass the (conjections) information that you have about the particular life of your colleagues worldwide!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when you share with you your most intimate secrets!
All that you have heard, and don't shine about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things of him.
Are you going to license for illness injustly?
When you call the office on phone and say you are sick and ill, you feel bad or well, you feel that the day you prefer to relax; think that others should do your job, your impossable tasks, your work in terms.
Don't hurry him to your colleague!
If you know that the next day you will not go to the office or may happen something, so you must stay at home, communities, so that your colleagues or chief do not have to compare with you the next day.
Tarares, rhythms, telephone calls
You're put into your work, but you're gonna get out of him the shoes of your colleagues?
Have you heard a telephone conversation involuntary that had been better not listening to you?
Don't smell your colleagues with your chairs, songs, high voice conversations (not less when you do them above your head), patters, constant blasphemys, expressing your discounts in high voice.
All of these can be angry, although they are not deep at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Did you swear to others for a mistake?
Don't get the fault to others if you didn't end at a time, you forgot to send a important letter or a message!
Don't hide the caos anyway in the office, nor the smile that make your colleagues!
You must recognise if you have made a mistake that harms others and you have to repair the lack!
Ask how you can repair your lack!
Are you feeling too much at the office?
Jogging and sapatillas: It's very comfortable for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a pleasant jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disreglated, respect your colleagues and yourself by seeing cotidian, elegant and pleasant clothes when your occupation requires it so!
Lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car slowly progresses in the morning's top habit.
It sounds a strange coma in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Get down the volume.
Change the ritm of music and the previous tones are added the lower and then the voice of a woman's core as a real joy interviens.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
National musical life has not made us much off with electronic quality pop.
But now it seems absolutely different when you listen to the new disk of Zagar.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2] digital [b3]nationally little will change the image and even though it is a moderate rock style, guitars break, the national pop electronic has demonstrated: there are news under the Sun.
Balazs Zságer started his cart in the city of Pécs, touched the whole Yunterboi until he started his independent carriage maybe because both couldn't be protagonists of the same together.
With its project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz mixture, electronic music and pop, triumphal triumph, when requested soundtracks [b4) cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The largest public was aware that in a principle was only actioned in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected his first disk edited in 2002 between the 50 most important national disks, classified in Zagar together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend former, which could also be sold in the Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his together are modest, but no one asked them whether they take or not this label.
The whole reacted how to react: prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently launched disk, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new ways for them, although the own title aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
So this title was one of the old lines of Balazs Zságer.
It's well referring to the airy, on the flight, but beyond the airful music, now appears - in accordance with the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitarra that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs the disk on the Millenaris György Ligeti, the song that currently works in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The disk includes a real success from the mr2 Petōfi channel which recently transmits from the morning to the popular music. This issue led to the ears of the radioists the high flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungary songs (Divas Underground).
So everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question is: what are you interpreting, in what measure is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Balazs Zságer: The definition of the public selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative music can also be abusive, without sense, and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can occur from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, independent of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the welcome of your music by the Hungary and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign, especially in the West of us, the light music has greater traditions.
There is not only the generations of 15 and twenty years frequently the concierts, but also the oldest.
It takes much more attention to changes that are produced around the light music, because they consider it as part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role has the public in your work?
Who are you, from where are they and how many people listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel well when you see more people on our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We're not composing music for any goal, but for any reason.
The role of the public is well feeling in the concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the unconceptive changes of the moment.
And yet I realize that if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: For what time do you want to follow Yunterboi's example?
He works in solidarity and made his career better in the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow their way, despite sometimes trying to compare our music with him.
We work better in the team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let us develop.
In a principle it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi music, as many of us started our car and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: The success list of mr2 Petōfi Wings of Love is on the first place.
Many people first heard the name of Zagar in relation to this song.
Did you open this style to a wide range?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great success and to sell these successes with our disk.
This song is something more than that.
We add it at the end of the disk, trying to relaxe after the sound body of the disk and the weakest topics.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six songs?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a coro to the gospel style.
Then the idea was to create this core of the solars of good voice of our own national musical scenario.
Thus was created that core of six women - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikō Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was then baptized as Devas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Have you so made the song or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we had all the disk material, we think it's still lacking something.
The rhythm was cut into the song.
That night, I recorded the song that later they learned the girls.
It was almost the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was so excited at that time, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so strong.
hvg.hu: both in the conciert and on the disk looked like the girls were on the second floor.
There is no solists (except the short one of Judy Jay), have no own role, they can sing all together and not stronger than music, so music is not only accompagning their songs.
In the scenario, it is also located in the background.
Really?
B.Zs: They're on the fund only for technical problems.
In turn, we wouldn't want to distribute the roles of solalists.
The song also looks about it, on which we forgot a rat of our ego, who is from where he came and where he is, let them go, the rivers of love take us up.
It would have been desired to achieve that others also symptoms the state of evolution that we feel when we born this song.
hvg.hu: What has you dedicated more work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in reality to no one, better at the time to mix the harder pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play in a conciert plan or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where during the long time I didn't want to work, and then, little things were put to his place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disk?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I've already "solved" the disk.
Now the prophet is a Fool, the escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
A tractory ball swimming run runs thousands of millions for its minority complex
A misleading infidelity.
This is how his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, is the giant French banker of General Society, also the Checo Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player that I wanted to compare his colleagues and, without doubt, with good capacity.
A long time ago, unlike all the large checa banks, the crisis on the market of hypotheses in the United States.
"Thank a virgin" was left to hear from his superiors, the same as they sent him to the police.
But what is disappointed from Kerviel's responses according to what they cross the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, was that it was a man who was over 1,600 million euros at the end of the last year.
Crisis not only in America
"That I wanted to do was win money for my bank" ensures in your answers.
Precisely, in summer, he gained 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen her coming to the beginning of the year.
In February, some news were started to hear about the sub-principal hypothetic calls offered to low income customers or those in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and correctly posted.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.600 million.
"When I won my first 500 million, I don't know how to notify it," Kerviel admits and adds, which hasn't been left for him, in absolutely.
During all the questionnaire, she declared that it had falsed the records so that it would not be found.
Even the chiefs, even when the Eurex Bolsa began to interest in his business.
Risk converted to benefit
Did you have to find out?
Well, no.
"I thought I had winned $1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact it would enjoy you."
Where did he get so much willing force to strive in that way?
In my position it should work gradually.
He went to work in the General Society in 2000, exactly after finishing study in Lyon.
The annual loan was held between $51,000.
Two years later, it was already Bolsa's runner assistant, and in 2005, it became a $90,000 per year.
I still knew I would never win as well as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I have already observed that they looked at me with care.
Because of my training and my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described researchers.
But at a short time of my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a low amount of EUR 500 million.
And this took a starting mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you won, we leave you
"This is like a snow ball," said the police.
But it is said that the chiefs knew of all this, or that better suspect it.
"When I wined money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, afterward, the shooting came to the beginning of this year.
One day it lost a million of euros.
After the weekend to half January I wanted to remove all the hole.
When the Monday came to work, I wasn't working in the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that he had lost 5,000 million euros for his fault.
And how could they find him?
It's been suspected from his holidays.
"I've only elected four days for the past year.
The driver who has no holidays is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his poster” concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 billion
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed last night with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Republic of Czech can reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 million colonies).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
From seven operational programmes, about 125 million corones will be paid for the regions.
Checa firms can obtain about 100 million coronas of the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The majority of the money will be intended for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State fund for transport infrastructures that the next year will contain 90.800 million coronas.
The enterprises and innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and enterprises to obtain resources in business innovation.
The enterprises should achieve funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recent income that less use it.
twenty-year-old prison for the president of Nicaragua, decreed the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed the sentence of 20 years for the president of the country, Arnaldo Germany, which was sentenced in 2003 by the disruption of $1,800 million (only $1,000 million).
Despite that, a while later, he was released from the prison to pass to home arrest in his hazelance outside the Nicaraguêns metropolis.
There is nothing clear in these moments, according to the AP Agency, that the chief of the Central American state is back between 1197 and 2002.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, he will depend better on the prison officials if they leave Germany to complete their punishment at home or if they return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Germany continued to pass the government's money into the account of a company in Panama.
This society was physician, and the account was actually belonging to its closest families and parties.
The part of this money has been concluded in the fund created by Germany to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
Thus we adopted the budget
And that's it.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this Government and accepted by the majority of coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved by the support of the SSD, since it was prepared by the Minister Sobotka and SSD could not be allowed to accept it.
In addition to various discussions before the vote on the vote on the Government ' s trust vote, it has not occurred.
The parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view, even the most influenced, adopted with tranquility the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and leaves from the budget, you will enjoy them or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it is hidden by the rivality of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore provide special attention to you.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State budgets of the last social democratic governments suffered from three defects that for 2008 it is not so easy to solve:
The first of them is the high participation of the obligations laws called as the expenditure of the mandate who are not only pensions, but also the social benefits that the last year had already been adopted before the elections by the "silky" coalition of sSD and KSōM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the largest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
However, the clock bomb is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many of the funds to obtain other investment sources, separate from the money of the taxes, rates and credits of the banks, often employed obligations with which they debt unproportionally to their loans.
In the past years, these debts were able to be paid through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks receiving the state and privacy.
They are currently not counting with this resource.
If we look at only official and verified facts, we found that:
Our economy, a few years ago, passes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which is shocked in SSD.
This was the ideal time that his Government would order the financing of the State.
However, instead of that, the state continued to debt.
The rest of countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our Republic.
It is a great honour that, above all, falls in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
The social massive programmes that, unfortunately, were unnecessary in the past few years.
And although they have been able to remove part of the uncomprehensible popular expenditures adopted this year before the elections, if shortly the age of jubilization and the reform of pensions will be the end of any policy in this country and the rule that rule will only be a simple bureaucracy.
As far as we can say, politicians who governed will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of payment taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenditure of the mandate expenditure.
The deficit planned over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not been malgaging in the past 10 years.
We don't want to make political officials only to be officials, so we must be patients and grant the government's weak coalition, which is understood that the state can only cost what is possible to obtain taxes and rates, the tranquility for the preparation of other law reforms.
Only this will allow the Palestinian achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Swiss and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis of the financial market.
In the Monetary Market, more than 100 billion dollars will be received through offers.
Banks undertaken the types of interest for which they are able to provide money.
For example, the United States Fed will send for $4 billion, and then other twenty-five million will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, central banks of different states are first agreed in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital deficiency that banks could provide" wrote in their report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Group Advisory Company.
"This coordinated action of the central banks probably reduced the receipt in the United States of 65 per cent to an 50 per cent," added Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already paid sixty billion dollars in employed credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect thousands of millions in loss.
"The central banks should really be afraid of what they still expected when they decided to give this step," said the main economicist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", added.
Central banks are afraid that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to provide more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the receipt with different effects on global economy growth.
The central banks decided so, after they could not reduce the called LIBOR, the London banking tariff that was used for the loan of money on the interbank market.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of paying money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain have reduced their types of interest several times during the autumn.
"He will have the same effect as another fall of the types of interest," said to the Reuters Agency, Greg Save of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some economics are not surprised that the step given by central banks will contribute to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Claus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change affects mostly the developing countries.
President Václav Klaus was again expressed with regard to the problem of global calentization.
The criticism now occurred with the clause of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented its Blue book, not the green planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the retorics used and the reality.
"Then the debates are only structured, are artificial fires of words, replaced by the solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The President of the Czech Republic during the presentation of its book stressed that this issue is very important for him and that it was therefore interested in it.
He also expressed his joy by discovering his book translated to German because, as he said, "That many times I am only meeting with the load of my ideas."
Now interested persons can be informed about their variety of opinions.
Klaus recalled that it is not a climateist, but he has, according to his opinion, enough evidence as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized distortion, has experiences with statistics and is also economic.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his thinking that the climate is constantly changed and that its changes are normal, that on the calentization of the planet there is no agreement between the scientists, that the consequences of the current change are not so large and serious, nor represent potential disasters, and that the attempts to influence the climate development are inutile, inefficient and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarians considers that it is inacceptable to imposing non-profit opinions to others, which feels like a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
The questions of the present were repeated that it was not against "the reasonable environmental defenders, but against ecologists that do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same theme spoke Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600.000 people did not get to change their cart to drive
The date was passed to six hundred thousand drivers, and therefore they were not able to change their old carne to conduct the validity that ended at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask the change to the officials of their time up to the end of the year in issue of the new carne.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that, after a new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are found without the valid carne.
According to traffic, the carne has not changed it mainly those who do not even want to drive.
While people announce a rapid decline in the change of carnes, the metrópolis offices are filled with requests and the interest of the new carne has increased.
The accommodation calculates around 2.000 daily customers.
A half hour is expected in the collars.
The new carne in Prague has not yet been removed around 140,000 drivers.
The emission of a new carne takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the carne emission in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay 15 corones.
The drivers who bindingly have to change their carney and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go to the roads without the valid carne will be attracted to a currency from January.
The infractor will pay a maximum of two thousand coronas.
The police can correct the offence with an admonition.
If it is an administrative offence, the currency will be at 2,500 coronas.
According to the previous information, the person who does not go to anywhere could receive a lot.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 coronas.
The Ministry urged the offices to be moderately income of thousands of columns as maximum.
According to the vocal of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, thousands of crowns are not threatened to anyone.
According to him, the chairman to drive is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the character of identity that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should deliver the carnaval to drive.
Quit to carry it or send it by email to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the carnaves issued during the 1964 and 1993 were valid.
However, the drivers should be little to change the other types of carne to drive.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the carne issued between 2001 and 2004 ended in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2,6 million documents.
The court cleaned the punishment to the compulsory detectives of Berdych
The former police Josef Opava and Petr Kośaの accused of compliance with the criminal David Berdych will pass between thirty and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as definitive for the reduction of punishment, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives of the department practised against organized crime would, in a principle, fall between 14 and 12 years.
The decision of today cannot be recurred, only through the revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he first waits for the Court of First Instance.
Despite other processes, it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't receive any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, was revoked to 16 of them.
The majority of the accused accused were rejected by the investigation because of the investigation of invented causes.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, police members in accordance with Berdych have provided information on police sources to criminals, covered robs, and helped criminal group members to avoid punishment.
These crimes delivered 30 percent of their rob to Opava and Kośaśík.
The accused relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Their victims had serious impact on their health, but they were also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permission.
In the home record, the police found a number of weapons, a weapon munition with a steel nucleus, a laser director and a metrallator.
The group of criminals, according to the accused, stole them tens of thousands of colonies.
Except almost twenty men in this process the court has already recognized guilty for Berdych and other guilty.
Other men relating to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pśt and Maroš Šulej, who are now avoided the judgment, are in prison in Ireland where they expect the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A account to change some children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity House the lawyer of the families affected, Igor Veleba wants 12 million in the hospital of Tśebič, more than the expenses of judgment.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondśej Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with the Veleba proposal.
"This request we do not approve it, it's too high," said Dostal after the meeting of today.
"In order to make an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist sent by the counterparty.
We will warn if you have a reciprocal value.
We remain in the view that they will be hundreds of thousands for everyone” said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 corones for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jabloś wanted, each month that did not create his biological daughter, a million coronas.
Velaba was served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only developed in the Hospital of Motol Machine in Praga.
The parents of girls according to psychological and psychological experts suffered from psychological and stress of different levels and deepness.
The stress situation was better supported by men even if they were fighting with recruitments for the change of girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are living today and with what happens today, completed Veleba.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Tśebič maternity House last year, on December 9,
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the śermákový to Pśibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloś.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 colonies as compensation costs for the error made in the hospital of Tśebič that the region was administered.
All the hospitals of the Czech Republic are insured by law as damage responsibilities.
In the case of errors, the reserve and extraordinarily support may be requested to the administrator.
The court until today recognised a relatively low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables accounting for hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly from a million colonies.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polivka lost the pledge on the Kingdom mark of Valaquia.
According to the court of the Provincial Court of Ostrava, it was the first who used the Kingdom mark of Valaquia, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabisch with whom the actor cooperated.
Polívka was not presented today at the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case probably has not ended and your customer will recurr.
"The pledge is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, all the world comes to him the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We're taking about ten years of work after us.
Search of money and inventation of activities," said.
For him, the cause of pleasing is in the money.
"After years, I realized that the project has success and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," added.
It's a children's book, right?
According to the court, the Kingdom mark was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohatī was coronated.
Then it was not tried to direct it toward the creation of a firm kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš was editing the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that cosmic origin awarded a business and a lucrative business, which Harabiš created after the Kingdom Society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of its name and signing in passports and even offered its owners discounted to visitors of its farm and assistants to their spectrums.
Who will sit on the throne?
The court today also decided that Harabiš was only using a simple idea that Polívka made public in the scenario for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the people of the Kingdom of Valaquia," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project is Harabiš and its team who were completely dedicated to it.
The cooperation, among the today discovered parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that time they started conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the decay of the "king Boleslav I, the elected forever".
The main role in the Kingdom, through Harabiš's mediation, declined in the song of Jamila Šulákova, as a mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accused against Harabiš and its society that has been rejected by the court until now.
Anything clearly could bring into the lit, the throne towards his princess, which is already preparing Harabiš.
He should get out of the new king.
You did not want to release more data or data.
"We don't have any time.
I'd have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king should be elected at a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can be presented," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: overcome prejudices
Actually, I never liked Peugeotu 206.
His driving features never were special, the quality of the change box, and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now its successor, Peugeot 207, exists in the market, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I'm just thinking about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I recalled, for example, the head space in the backer sit.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi's carriage means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Watching the World
I step through the inside fast to not repeat it too much.
This is a elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would be more valued by designing, even though the car seems quite elegant.
The sisters are comfortable, there are the times in which we wanted from short seats and supported.
In contrast to the model 206, the lateral direction has significantly improved.
And space, and here you can feel how you have grown the carriage measures.
In the Combi, the quoted lack of space in the head.
Sweet to snake
But the main thing in this vehicle is your skin.
This must be assessed as a very accessible (by the swimming portion) and a well-divided storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with goma mails that have an ideal solution.
No moles, and it can be extended until the point of subjecting weighted objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
According to tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres in the basic regime, which is better than a average value in comparison with competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav model, we realize that Peugeot remained at the same time with its perceptive 52 litres.
From holidays to foreign or by putting the child's car is critical.
But if I had to comment something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains pretty planned after attacking the supports of the second line.
120 horses in four walks
Our car tested was equipped with a four-called injection incense on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And indeed, it's how to look like a 1600 that less valued the family five doors.
It's quiet, consuming little and especially, it's impulse.
If I compare it with the time of the shoods then that looked like the escape tube would be shooted by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices are answered
The price of the car is not for all buses.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested a elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection fire of 1400 by 329.900 coronas is still possible.
Our adherents put it from 410.900 corones, which is already too much.
The type of Premium tested has already reached 80,000 corones.
Only if we still have an airbag in the heads, air conditioning automatically, automatic cleaning, automatized trash windows...
I mean, the car with all that, it costs 531.900 coronas.
It's much, but counts with the complements of the team in the Fabia and will reach a very similar number.
Now only one is decided for what of the two brands.
Slovakia students are not integrated in English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern Europe are assisting, and thereby places fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans by now is only a series of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase violence.
The problem of integration of Eastern European children in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern town of Kent where they began to grow conflicts between the peoples and the Slovak migrants.
Discussions, extorsion and broken between students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has arrived so far that Chatmam's police arrested a Slovak woman who was taking balls to a ten-year student with a green ball.
In his defense, the girl was insulting her son with racist tonn insults.
The police had to act also after a attack of two young girls of age against a Slovakian immigrant.
The girls kidnapped him with racist insults and took stones to him.
"When we knew at home, a boy closed to us at the stop of the bus and began to shoot us.
When I told her that he would leave us the ademan of swimming us smells and perles, and then the pants were slept and showed us their back," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovakia student.
The shoes are from both sides.
One of the nations even designed the conflict with Eastern migrants as a fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned above shown us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tension.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovakia inscribed here for working reasons.
About 30,000 Slovakia students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really the island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can be achieved until you choose correctly.
Snakes and sweet games, big oils or a tranquille sea like a snake.
Palmers and all of them included with cameras offering pizzas on the beach, heavy or several cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and rule.
On the Caribbean island, you can find all this and much more.
Only in a island is still much more and that island is Cuba, the most beautiful and most beautiful of all the Great Antilles islands.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba came to be the bastion of the American conquest.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place that human eyes have seen.
Havana became a store and loading portion of the stores that the Spanishs left out of America and brought into Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew up at the end of the 20th year.
He sent him to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all that had criminality in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, games and prostitution.
Among his guests were found, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In La Habana, high buildings arrived, the cars that were a worship symbol in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway was accommodated in San Francisco de Paula, near the Habana, and Cojimar had his yate.
In the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, they left their signs the stars of the world of the spectacular and political world of America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the charming hotel, the National Hotel mixes the coctels according to his desires.
And those cars from worship in the 50s, until today continue to work by La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat that have arrived long ago have been oxided between these weeds and salad winds.
Even when La Habana, in particular the ancient barrier, is deteriorating significantly, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments in the area.
Other places are metamorfoseed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money that it needs, its development is guaranteed.
In the past 15 years, new hotels increased not only in La Habana, but also in Varadero, the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is very valued by the rail lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the largest plants to the sugar factories in closer ways in vacuum or electric machines.
His cars for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brothers models that are in other parts of the world are only located in the museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe only remember that in the already quoted Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are loved by the writer, you should not stop visiting him.
The Valley of Viñales is the most picture of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exubering vegetation that grows in calcian rock lands.
Mogotes, hot rock pills and high-scale rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their grains the lands are accumulated thanks to which rocks are formed to hide from the vegetation.
The valley is the place where it grows, probably, the higher quality smoke in Cuba.
Visiting some of the purple manufactures can be found with your final product.
Perhaps someone seems interesting that there was the Chile part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinity
Old city, I appeal that it was not long after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and rich.
The richness became beautiful with the buildings in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French columns arrived later, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sheriff of Escambray, is a so-called place that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road that joined her with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped her to stay outside the rest.
Nothing new was built, and therefore, no one was destroyed, because every person was happy to have where he lived.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than one afternoon, you must know interesting places in the neighborhoods such as the Ancon Play or the Valley of the Sugar Fabrics.
the night belongs to the Much House, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the west extreme of Cuba, some consider it as the most beautiful island.
With security that view is already confirmed by the own way.
The two roads that arrive from Guantánamo must pass through high and cut mountains, as well as for a nature that only knows the action of man.
This Eastern site of Cuba has been registered as the Humanity Heritage by UNESCO thanks to its natural intake.
There they do the best chocolate, in your church, have the colon cruce (this is actually a cross that came 100 years later from the departure) and from the colline, where the castle was found and that there is now a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, Yunque.
Café, ron, pure, Sierra Maestra, the Bahia des Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the bosom of Cuba, the Virgin de la Caridad del Cobre, the Santiago, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of which can be filled many pages.
However, as you say, it's better to see it once.
Alliances are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
A few soldiers and inadequate equipment necessary is what is influenced by the mission movement in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to the American Defence Minister, Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not resulting as it was thought, the representatives of the countries with troops in the south of the country agreed in Edimburgh (Scotia).
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban movement, the eight participating states today discuss the plans and coordination of the partners.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged the NATO forces to increase the activity, Greece sees as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government authority and the distribution of development aid.
" Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is the possibility to the population that they only can start economic and security development", said BBC, Minister of Defence, Des Browne.
The nineteen percent
The activity of rebellious Afghan according to the data of the American army is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in 27 percent, and in the province of Helmand up to 60 percent.
NATO countries are in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers whose fourth part is in the south of the territory.
However, alliances have reached the same limit for the organization and equipment of units for the United States.
Exactly request more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we reach them", said Gates.
In a similar sense, today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Japan, spoke.
"I'm not glad to know what we have on the earth and the heavens in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams we need, and that's little," said De Hoop to the Reuters Agency in the closure of the meeting three days with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assistant countries in the past months implies the polyemic of whether all partners do the maximum in Afghanistan.
For passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
" Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimum violence and there are no struggle requirements so high as in our, in the south and eastern of the country," said Gates.
The sensational journalist Sun, this week, called the German soldiers vagues.
"The rebellious Afghans discover that the Germans are dedicated to play while our kids fight" wrote Sun in a material accompanied with German soldiers photos by playing the table tennis.
German Image responded to the attack and published a photo where the British troop played a ruby game in the south of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
The State shall be 84.000 coronas for each twenty-first twenty-five.
The total debt led to 842.700 million colonies in September.
This year the government planned to provide 159,200 million corones.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million corones thanks to improved the development of the economy of the State budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to 842.700 million colonies.
In nine months of this year, 40.200 million colonies increased.
However, since June, 13,400 million colonies were decreased.
Thus, today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the starting state of October.
For each cheque, the debt corresponds to 84.000 coronas.
Over the last year, the State was debt to more than 111 million colonies.
"For now it seems to be that thanks to the low deficit of the next year we could pass the border of the billion corones until 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between the $900,000 and the million of coronas," said to the iHNed.cz server, Patria Finance Economist, David Marek.
Similarly, it is also the economicist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "We could pass the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we have not yet known.
If the situation in the changed political scene and the politicians were able to smell, they could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see that change," he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the State creates debts in the central government and, above all, the accumulation of the deficit of the State budget.
The debt of the State is paid by means of the shrine, state obligations, direct credits, or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal deduction of the state increased this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million corones.
The external debt has now grown from 1.700 million corones to 123.300 million coronas.
The calling debt of the negotiatable state at the end of September contained 803.300 million coronas Z since June was decreased in 13.700 million colonies.
The average wage of the State debt increased in 6.5 years.
"The total inter-annual debt of the first to the third quarter creates a 13 percent of which is largely given as the economy functions.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It's bad that debt grows, but on the other hand shows that it's going to be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions" commented Pikora.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
The 2007 State debt strategy and payment management strategies outlined that the Government planned 159,200 million colonies this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan in 152,800 million corones thanks to the improvement of the State budget.
The amount is mainly composed of the deficit of the State budget that this year will be 76 million colonies instead of the expected 91.300 million colonies.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Checaan Consolidation Agency with about 13,3 million colonies, the reserve of 10 billion corones for pension payment, 43 million corones to finance state obligations and 1,800 million corones in payments from the European Investment Bank.
It was compared today before a court to Jartum to have given a name to a shooter shooter
The British professor judged in Sudan for insulting the Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Jartum Court on 15 days of prison and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of abandoning students from 6 to 7 years of driving the name of Mahomet to a sleeve shoe when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was passable to a lattigue punishment.
This British School of 54 years of age in the United States of Jarthum in Sudan has been detained Sunday in his home and infringement to attend Islam and Section, under article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, as a result of a number of complaints of student parents at the Sudan Ministry of Education.
The story is in fact restored in September, when this teacher requests his students 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the skin of the class.
" Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, accounting for the director of school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children of each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the prophet Muslim, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then children have made a book for the class with the skin photo with the following reader " My name is Mohamed " .
He himself did not bring any label with this name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as a insulto to Islam.
One of the Islamic colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, Professor at the same school in Sudan, needed that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insultant towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry that he had asked the children to vote for a name ", according to him, it is only a " innocent error " .
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher which describe it as " very attention to their students " and " which never speaks of religion in class " .
Remember that Mohamed's name is also the second most name given in Great Britain, it is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (in often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that confer to the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it a game?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
The Monday has not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Serbias and the Albanians of Kosovo have finished Monday in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separate province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a Statute Agreement," stated the European Mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
He stressed that peace in the region was " in game " , his American homolog Frank Wisner urged Belgrado and Pristina to respect its efforts to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not predict violence at now, but in a very difficult period, " he added that " evident tension exists " .
End of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the tropical, which responds to the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the population province to 90% of Albanians could be more clear when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship with the United Nations Security Council from 10 December.
Baden's debate near Vienna consists of the sixth and last negotiations since the troc has been carried out with a new mediation by the United Nations, last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the concession of independence in Kosovo, insist on the persecution of negotiations beyond that date.
" Russia was and was compromised for a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of Administration of the United Nations of Kosovo, the Westerns believe that the independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve.
Belgrado insists on an increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found ", announced the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden Hotel, where they were celebrated since Monday these " negotiations of the last opportunity".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the rebellion of Kosovo and the future Prime Minister of province, has been part of its weakness.
But he added that the Belgrado's autonomy plan "it belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
"Effect dominated "
The Serbian President Borís Tadic considered that a commitment was always fair, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrado particularly expresses fear of a " dominated effect " in a region still deficiened by independence wars in the 1990s.
"To Serbia, said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible. "
On Monday, the Serbian delegation had emphasized that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, " stated the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostuni.
" These negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from Albanians would be " in concertation " with the Western.
Bush launches an agreement between the Israelites and the Palestinians
The President George Bush announced, during the opening of the International Peace Conference held by him on March in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelites and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He needed that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the age of 60 years between its two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a "life treatment" before the end of 2008.
In particular, the Palestinians should dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end up their colonization activities, stated Bush, remembering both parties to their obligations regarding itinerary for peace that they have accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would try to " to conclude a peace treaty which would solve all matters that would, unless otherwise, include central issues " .
This designation covers the three main challenges of the conflict between the Israelites and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem, and the luck of the Arab refugees excluded from their homes during the conflict of 1948.
By taking the word after the President of the United States, Abbas stressed that future negotiations should be "global and deeply" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, quoting " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
After turning back to the court, Olmert understood that future negotiations were "direct and continuous" and "un effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush concluded at the end of 2008 the term of its " vision of two Palestinian States " and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had made an effort in this part of Bush before decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all the Arab countries, which proposes Israel's peace in change of its retirement from all Arab Territories that are occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marked " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects ", estimates Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the lawyer, the police is not responsible.
What happened precisely, last Sunday?
Like always in this type of events, official versions and voice are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the French National Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car moved on Sunday, short after 17, Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in an intervention but in a patrol, and circled 40-50 km/h, without turning a police source.
A green motor of the Kawasaki Mark, " not authorized, or is not authorized to circulate in the public way " (read below) and conducted by two young people without castle, circle " to all gas " .
"He passed the police car on the left side, after a chain incomplete the step to the right, " the police needs.
The control of alcoholism practiced on the occupied of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the part of the shocked front, farmed parabrists, launched parachutes) witnesses the violence of the shock.
Soon, last morning, the lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère of Givry, announced that he had granted an investigation for " involuntary murder and relief denied " to the IGPN, co-co-co-co-co-co-operational direction of the public security of Val-d'Oise.

This calculation takes into account the unwanted predominant pregnant pregnant (24 per cent) as well as the unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than a pregnancy of each three (36%) is not expected, a study conducted by the National Institute of Democratic Studies (Ined), fourty years after the vote of the Newheit Law that liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted predominant pregnant pregnant (24 per cent) as well as the unplanned or unexpected births.
The different contraception methods such as pill or sterelet are still a fracture index of 5% to 6%, estimated Ined.
However, the liberalization of the contraception allowed a better " domesticity " in the institution that notes that the pill-use index between women from 20 to 44 years was of 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a few or less than a month for a couple of each five and if possible for spring, timely judged as the most convenient to have a child.
spectacular reparation of the space station
There will be no more than seven hours of work in space at the Scott Parazynski astronaut and his partners of the International Space Station (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a discharged and essential sun panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A rare outcome that accumulated records because of their duration, from their displacement of the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, by the astronaut instruments to make the repair.
The problem occurred on Monday when the astronauts had released from the Harmony Module, a cylindrical piece of cylindrical gruesa that was responsible for soon accompaniing European and Japanese laboratorys (see rounded).
This module is a type of atterration for laboratory modules.
But there must be a power to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the tripulation was to move a electricity production module with solar panels that were weighing 17.5 tonnes, already presented in the ISS, in order to put it into its final position.
After moving it, the tripulation began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that had a 76 meters (76 m).
And it's where one of the panels, which are deployed as acondicions, has been damaged in a few or less than one meter by a cable rounded.
The deployment has been stopped not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had to first conduct a control output of the Discovery lantern, and then go to repair another sun pane whose rotation system was defectuous, were forced to dedicate to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to characterize at the end of the 30 meters long of the telediged arm of the laundry added to the station to make the repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" of Nasa.
High, resistant, very busy, has the very developed torch and the long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the sun panel "hered".
After inspecting the damages exactly, he set the fallable cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped him the second "spacewalker " that was close to the air exclusion and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, commander of the tripulation.
The tool that he used is a hockey minibase with a isolator to avoid electricity in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of volts, has been designed and chapuced by the astronauts on the board of the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott Parazynski hoped that the panel will be completely displaced before making the inventary of its instruments and returning inside the station.
Tonight, the astronoms made use of a medium of rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery laundry for the return to the earth expected Wednesday.
The EADS title sanized in Bolsa
The EADS Action is currently lowly reduced to the Paris Bolsa, after the Aircraft and Defence Group has announced that it will have to pay between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to face the delays of the A400M.
EADS is now losing 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Bolsa.
The group was obliged to review its predictation of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which condemns the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of paying the delay taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, " between 1,2 and 1,4 million euros from which more than 1 million for Airbus " announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
As a result of these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, it adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new charges is coherent with the delay of six months.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS was 86 per cent in 2006, mainly because of loads linked to the delays of another programme, the slower of the A380 portator.
At first, the group predicted the first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the Statute quo
No surprised Sunday, at the outdoor of the urnes: Russians will opt massively for the party of President Poutine, United Russia.
Reaffirming its aspiration to stability, including the authorism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin guides them today to electors a television message on public chain, already registered but whose content is saved secret.
He does it as a leader of the list for the united Russian, the pro-Krimlin party whose victory is depleted.
Last night, the President left nothing transparent by receiving foreign embassy, satisfied with delivering a new load against the Western accused inheritance - its prediction topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we wish honored, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Denotes a campaign handled by pressures.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there is no "always had so sweet elections, even at the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the last week's end, at the ex-campagne of the world of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians watched the mentality of the Soviet man."
After these no surprise legislative elections, two more open questions are profiled:
Who will happen to Putin to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published on 2 March 2008 the first tour of the presidency election; the candidates have until 23 December to meet themselves.
Elected in 2000 and again elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful Russian unite party that would elect the Government and the President?
In any case, legislative elections such as the presidents will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians looked at the mentality of the soviet man, they do not feel debtors of their destination ", estimates the sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, was far away: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community has delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Poutine restored the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic deficit ", María Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " renumber their own will to the personal responsibility " of those who had recently been tested after the U.S.S. statute.
"Why do you reflect?"
The phenomenon touchs all social faces, including the world of matters.
And the administrative eleite thinks to keep the status quo: 65 rulers (of each 85 rule of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the unified Russian.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of caos, as in the 1990s.
The view prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote too by extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why do you reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them? "
You don't think we're coming in!
After over 60 years of confidential nature, the nazis archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessed.
The 47 million file documents stored over 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not only consultable for a "humanitary purpose," namely individually and nominatively, on request of an ancient victim or its lawyers.

Together in Bad Arolsen, over 300 permanent asalariates are treating tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen reviewed a limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents, " in 2006, Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre in the Berlin Technical University.

Does it be rally of the end of the year in a tass? Experts, divided by the "subpress" crisis.
By less than five weeks to delay the end of the year, investors are already frozen by expecting the traditional rally of the end of the year.
However, this year the experts do not have so clearly that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "depending on the statistical view, the month in December generally has a positive behavior.
However, predictions should not be made exclusively based on statistics, even more because in the current context, incertitudes are at least on the markets in the short term."
Although they are not parties to the fact that the cup coat coat in the last few weeks of the year, these experts pointed out that "the bursail market is supported by the existence of liquidity, available to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect to quality values both in the long and short trails".
They therefore believe that the cup will have a more lateral behavior, not an exemption of volatility "to all because it is not known the effect of the probable decline of the types of Fed, given the high level of crude and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions."
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it's not a good time to adventure to say that it's gonna be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joy," ensures the expert.
Ibex lost about 4% from the maximum marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Not yet all experts have this negative vision.
Joan Solana, an analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearly 16.000 points thanks to the restructuring of cards and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year.
However, the expert thinks that things will be something different this year since it believes that rally will be forwarded to the second week of December after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analyst, values that we are close to technical levels and "we could soon see a retreat of the index that could be stimulated depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analist trusted that these are positive.
The analysts agree to the time to select the values that will be taken to bring to the Ibex to new maximum counts.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that "this year touchs the greatest values".
The expert would include in the cartridge the two large banks and some constructors "for when the date is reached, the electrical sector will be very precious."
While, Federalico Olucha, the Investis Bank ensures that the slows will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS takes several months by recovering positions and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC continue their same way", explains the experts.
Cyclic consumption shall be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the time of shipment sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also make it very well, although in this case there is no great representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, only two times of December has been a bajist month.
The real rally of the end of the year was lived in 2003, in which Burunty markets were out of the crisis caused by the pink of the technological bourbon.
This year, in which Ibex 35 was recovered by 28.17%, December registered a reputation of 6,68%.
It will be see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the time Ibex is up to 8,36% from January) and if it can be counted with its final year rally.
People will open 200 offices on Sunday 12 hours to Sunday
People have decided to renew a major part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These succursales, which will operate under the Popular Max Mark, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since it is the first group that is decided to give the salt to support the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 p.m. and open the Sabbaths from 10 p.m. to 20 p.m...
Another group that has also reiterate in several occasions that would like to extend the time of its BBVA succursale, has not yet been decided to make the step.
At the same time, there is a point to close an agreement with the unions to close the 75% of its offices on Saturday in change of opening a late, even though not to the public.
The outcome of the people's experience will be decisive to ensure that other entities will be acknowledged or not to this initiative in accordance with the trade times.
This is precisely the goal that continues people with the project.
To capture particular customers that are moved through these areas to make their purchases, pymes, autonomes and road trades for opening.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain for some 18 months, since they are not new, but restoration of the existing offices.
To this end, the entity will modernize the succursale that is already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that will present customers from the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the time is composed of a different concept of the succursal space and a new design, more current, with lighter colors.
The commercial bank responsibilities, Angel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not have a larger investment, although a higher staff contract, since six employees are held by a local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even contain spaces for pymes to meet there, will sell non-financing products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, explaining Angel Rivero.
Bravo Murillo streets, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be sweet, according to the river.
People account at the current with 2.500 succursales.
And other 60 operating under the Mundocredit Mark, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide times, even opening Sundays and Festivals.
In these places of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices are accounting for a large non-financial products for their sale.
'We don't want to make competition to our customers,' says Rivero.
Now they have arrived to an agreement with Telephone to sell mobiles, with external staff to the bank.
TV doubles for the first time the value in the Bolsa of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction last night, Paul Vasile, the delegated adviser of Telecinco, when closing the market, when he found that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect of his joy was: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we have slowed down,' he stated.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'We have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished tonight with a progress of 2.54%.
This wine is the loss of it in which we take from the year in 15.66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) is 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His Rival Antena 3, which was eightening a 1,52% and accumulated 40.5% from January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other quoted communication companies is 3.575 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Price (Cinco Day Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 should be the case when we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how we are able to make, in the same market, what costs and how we reward it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced the last week that it was expected to convert this year into the first television chain to over 1,000 million brutal advertising income, according to Joseph Tringali, the Delegated Adviser of Telecinco and Public, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
In reality, this announced date, the TV chain would register a increase of 3.6 per cent in its public facturing compared to 965.4 million of the biennium 2006.
For its part, the net facturation of Antena 3 increased 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (by reaching 734.4 million) while the net television income increased 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors of analysts for the best relative development in Telecinco Bolsa is the high payout that has remained up until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevar would share 100 per cent of the benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to take the decision, this ratio may vary after purchasing 33% of endmol in association with your mediaset matrix.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave contents to our shareholders, whom we have already given the value of 33% of endmol.
According to analysts, the market shows samples at these moments of a certain candidate.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 a 4% and in 2009, 7%.
It should be explained that the expected income growth of 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5,5 per cent to 5,1 per cent in 2009.
The same subscription has decreased the winning prevention of Antena 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: Recommend to buy both values, mostly based on its high rentability by sharing and sustainable potential for a long term.
2.

3.
JPMorgan: recommends to be infrastructured in both cases when having 'some ammunition' (small and worse economic climate market).

The harmonised IPC increases five decimal in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves to Eurostat to integrate it in the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a progress in how to evolve prices in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the Eurostat policy and the European Central Bank (BCE) policy to provide time- and quality equipment data to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Employer for the Harmonized Consumption Prices Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to assess information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INA recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator was only a guideline, so it should not necessarily match the definitive date, which will be given to be known on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economy, Peter Solbes, stated that the slowing in a 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary cryption", but at the same time it has ascertained that the price index will continue in "relatively high" levels in the next months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the passes of the Congress that, although the digit is not good, the difference in the inflation of Spain with regard to monetary unity remains "more or less" the same in the last few years.
He also explained that in November "he had been less surprised" than in the previous month, when the Government did not contain such a high shock.
"We expected a 4% count", recognized the Minister of Economy about the date enhanced today.
Virgin plan for recursion with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock was decreased by more than 50% to 12.000 million libraries (16.800 million euros) since they entered in a mid-See crisis and had to go to an emergency credit from the Bank in England.
At that time there were some deposits recorded over 25,000 million libraries, which has been progressed in two months and a mid-middle by the incertitude of their customers, and in spite of the guarantee of 100 per cent of the money offered by the Government and that will remain until the end of the crisis.

Northern Rock named this week the Virgin consortium offer, in which three other companies participate, such as their favorite to save him from the banking.
Detented Totana's Chalk for the presumed trauma of urban corruption
The Civil Watch has stopped today at the first hour of the morning at the current stage of the Totana Municipal Municipality (the Popular Party) because of its presumable relationship with the trauma of urban corruption this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariats of the composer and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the past May to Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then government of the municipality, and that according to the sources of the research consulted by the SER Chamber, it could be the 'cabecilla' of this trauma.
Agents continue to register municipal dependences and the Council of Urbanism and have no more detention in the next hour.
Furthermore, the reader of Juan Morales, the principal suspect of the shocked urban corruption trauma at the beginning of this week.
Like last night, the SER Chamber, the lawyer of the 'popular' Juan Morales, was therefore encouraging, he was stopped out of the Morales' home with a significant documentation related to the trauma.
Moreover, the research aims, according to the sources of research, is the presumed cover of Morales commissions in order to facilitate the signing of a urban convention with a gallery constructor company to recall 200 hectares of land.

Good accepting the candidature of the PSOE by Toledo and chairing the Congress if they win
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offering of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to capture the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress if socialists win the general elections.
This has announced the secretariat of the Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and its own Bonus, after the meeting that he has held this average in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Executive Chief has justified the offer to the ex-Minister because "It's important to tell the best" in the political life and Bono "is between the best."
He also pointed out that "I think it" that the missing political will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress if socialists come in the next elections.
Bonus would be replaced as President of the Congress to Manuel Marín, who made public its decision to not be submitted to the next general elections and to leave his car in the active policy to fight climate change in the university.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has left to attend to return to the political vessel since she left it two years ago.
He also stated that, as citizens know who will be the economic vice-President if the PSOE wins the elections, its party has wanted to announce whom the Congress will preside in a "transparency act".
If it reaches the charge, Bono expects to convert the House into "the house of respect and not the insult or cry." and makes it "wise more like the citizens".
"Atimely regrettably, the only place in Madrid where it is not able to speak calmly and selfishly is the Congress, the President of the Government in a certain time interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He also had words of joy for his current President, Manuel Marín and "health to do" and he did not want to see her position to not fall in what, as he stated, his opposers could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is to immit persecution both the sceptics of its predictions and the other political and social battles, it is obliged to show a coherence of iron.
And more, a leader of the movement that is President of the Government as Zapater and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a “new contract with the planet”.
This approach is obligation to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has decisively contributed to Spain's heading in Kyoto's incompliance.
Who are responsible for the incompliance, in which sectors have been produced and why their Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Furthermore, it requires to explain the maximum clarity to the Spanish whose measures will be taken to cut the climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, what citizens should be changed, what individual and collective energy we will be able to do, what economic consequences will be.
Or who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But it has not been done, nor will there be any of these explanations.
It's just because it's about to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Costs, income and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Even the cemetery of the PSOE suggested gasoline has seemed to be so dangerous that Zapatero has been soon rejected.
Or, that is about to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With influence, committees, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for the election campaigns that neither speaks nor complains nor requires, but swallows the mixtures and inspires the ternure.
Always it is limited to be a commercially virtual contracting party and does not intend to move us into bicycles or refresh us with the abanics.
Totana's local police chariot and chairman for a presumed trauma of urban corruption
The Civil Watch has stopped the hall of Totana's murderplace, the "popular" José Martinez Andreo, head of the local police, the secretariat of the Ombudsman and a hostman for possible urban crimes, have now informed sources of research.
The building was arrested in his home and was transferred to the Consistent, in which dependences are located in these moments together with numerous agents, who have also attended the urbanism Concejary and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Vivienta Earth.
These three detentions are subject to the six last Monday in Galicia, Mauritania and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalling of more than 2 million rustic grounds in urbanization to ensure that the Nuria company builds 4,000 inhabitants, after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislation.
Furthermore, other two persons were not arrested, but are imprisoned in the sumary, which teaches the Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The six first prisoners have passed to courting today.
According to the sources, the previous government of Totana and today's PP's autonomy parliamentary, Joan Morales, is investigated.
Furthermore, the former woman, propietary of a today registered immobiliary agency in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girl of the former government, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur who lived in Manuel N.A., was arrested in Niglan (Pontevedra), as Paul José M.G., Director of the Inmonuar Land, an integrated Agency in the quoted Group, and through which the soborns were carried out.
The investigation is conducted by the Group of Urbanistic Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO), whose agents, in addition to detention, practiced 11 registers, most in enterprises related to detention and location in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.

Our Finnish corresponsal helps us this comment at the most important journal in Finland (for reality in the head of the PISA report on educational levels in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what published on November 18, the same day in which it appeared, curriculaly, the criticism of the December book:
"The content of the Filosofia's signature has led to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela school.
The guilty of the deaths, a Bachillerato student, quoted in his message the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser, responsible for the assignment of Philosophia, Pecca Elo, requested from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin said that the teachers take a critical attitude to Platon and said that study of Nietzsche is not essential in the binding course of Philosophia in the institutions."

A colleague provides information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of Criminal Discrimination on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be sentenced by six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal on the shopping disks by values less than 400 euros, it is just considered lacking (Article 623.1).
B. If you slaughter up to EUR 1.000, the slaughter is already crime, but the penalty remains below the load tax (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you rob a car and return it 40 hours later, the punishment remains lower than the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous ring has a punishment of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a punishment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual acid in the work is considered less serious than to drop a DVD film, in accordance with article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authors is more chastised than the pornographic material distribution to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone's going out of his hand, a very long hand.

My head physician extends me one of his articles on rare investigations referred to as: “The money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less”.
Of course, the feelings that generate the monthly payment of workers depend on what they win.
The study has been conducted through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of sciences.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the Image Group of Neurocognition of the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activement was produced when the participant correctly responded and his partner failed."
The investigators noted that if both were able to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if I would require such scientific conclusion.
The tax of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has eight years of implacable persecution of the Balcanian war criminals from the fiscality of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in the Hague.
His mandate ended at the end of the year and Carla will be with a agricultural sweet, because the principal responsibilities for the murder of Srebrenica, in which 8.000 Muslim bosnios, the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbour leader Radovan Karadzic, continue to be free.
His names are on that list which holds the documentary of the Swiss executor Marcel Schübbach, "The list of Carla" (2006, not exceeded in Spain), which, with the rythm of a police stripper, continues to work of the Swiss fiscal in Belgrado to New York to pursue the shocked criminals and to press the governments involved to stretch the circle.
What's sure of me?
The automobile security, which covers the driver before possible switchs, is a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, antiquity of carne, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Holding the car is just the principle.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car security is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear of what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the safeguard.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreed, as a result of the obligation of payment of compensations in the case of wrongdoers.
The first is the price of the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, gender, antiquity of the carne, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the greater probability of suffering an accident is greater than subscribed.
This is why both the elders of 25 and women have to pay lower prizes, since statistics reflect that they have a less illness rate because of their prudentity.
Also, with the hands of the accounts, companies have concluded that marriage persons have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some type of perception.
The increase in the frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that safeguards take into account at the time to establish the price of the prize.
It is therefore that the driver has to take care of the situation to choose that car security which is best adjusted to his profile.
Here we will exposure the most significant variables when you choose one or another type of insurance, so that you, in addition to adapting to the features of the assurance, offers you a reasonable price.
Youths under 25 years are several inconvenients at the time of contracting an insurance to a safe price, such as the reduced conduct experience and the antiquity of the carne.
Although the ideal to be well secured is an insurance at all risks, there are other more economic options.
The most precauted drivers can opt for every risk with franchice so they obtain the coverages of an insurance to any risk but to a more factual price.
This class of convention would suggest that the customer pays a part of the amount of the roller.
"The part of the amount of the client granted will be predetermined on the basis of the value of the primary, which will be higher than the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain, the mediator of online insurance.
Another option is an insurance to third-party, so that the customer is safely protected before damage caused to third-party, although not against the caused in its own car.
In addition, it would be covered by rob, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
An advisory.
If you are less than 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid malicious as far as possible, since this will affect the bonification, with a way to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonification is a reduction on the basis tariff that has the company.
On the contrary, penalization is a loan on that basis tariff.
"Receivements and punishment will depend on the company and benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year can be enabled to increase bonifications", it acknowledges Noguera.
The 25-year-old shipping drivers are easier at the time of contracting an insurance, since the uncertainty index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable is contracting a whole risk with franchise.
"Juveniles are normally not able to use the previous experience acquired at the time of a accident, and even at the time of conduct," ensures the director in Spain of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents are produced in the second driving year, once the 'more of the news' is already passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children, it is preferable to sell an insurance to all risks, always and when its economic situation is allowed, it is clear.
In its part, marriages with children are considered by safeguards as the public with less illness independence, so the loans will be less.
In this case, the best security would be one of the risks with franchise (which can be 300 euros), or, when a high bonification level is available, one to thirds expansive from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"Levan has a more relaxed conduct and has a more acquisitive power to allow the luxury to take a greater amount of franchise," courtess Luis Noguera.
For juveniles, it is recommended that an insurance of any risk with franchise (if it is 150 euros), or one to third-party, when a high bonification level is made.
It is necessary to say that car safety is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible wrongs, but also because it represents an important expenditure, for which it is essential to adequately study the insurance that is most convenient according to our personal situation.
Celtic Search in Milan a point that values the octavos
Milan and Celtic are midnight in San Siro in search of the point that they are missing to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions, since Italians serve them to be first and skoces to condemn their classification.
The Italians summarize ten points and have already certified their pass on the fifth day with a quarter in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go forward.
These two parties of the D Group will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to discuss the World Clubs in Japan, where it declares 13 in semi-final semi-final in search for a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and quarter in the Joseph Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, since Italians do not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning would be first and will be safely a better cross in octavos.
In the whole of Gordon Strachan, it could also serve to classify if Shakhtar does not win, but it can't be trusted because pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but win (2-0) in the other direct duty.
Thus, the Milanists will try to shock it the night to the skoces, which trusted in slowing into a second slow in the restructured Champions League and in consecutive way, after they were precisely cut into that round the past campaign with a Kaka's goal in the Progress (1-0) after the age's age (1-0).
Waiting the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in the case of Celltic loss, both to put it into eight and to follow in the EUFA.
And it is that, despite being the last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, the third place could be reached with a victory, which would play the EUFA.
20,000 people attend in Vancouver at the first conciert of the Spice Girls
The Girls Spice have started in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20,000 spectators, his first turn since they disappeared in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared a little prior to start their concert at the Vancouver GM Place that the group meeting is "sporty".
Around 20,000 people exploded the entry to present the concert that included a video in which the group's history was raised at the end of the 1990s.
The reencounter and the world tour matches the launch of a new album which collects its main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vodoo', which is published in Spain.
The five Gentiles of Spice Girls came to the scenario by lighting some bracelets who gave them the husband of Posh Spice, the British fusilist David Beckham.
The sportor was among the public that shooted the GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had been banned for days before.
At the beginning of the spectrum, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astro "he has not seen our clothes, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what to think of the spectrum."
'Sporty Spice', whose group was out of 1998 "for the differences between us", caused the dissolving of the fiftieth two years later, also expressed its nervousism during a press meeting, two hours before the spectrum began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Girls Spirit has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm pleased to have taken the decision," said Chisholm about the meeting of the group she solved for nine years ago.
The songer also pointed out that with time, "the things have been corrected and we all want."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl has lastly acted together in 1998.
To begin, according to the CTV TV, the group came to Vancouver in a special aircraft of Virgin Airlines.
When he arrived to the airport, he was waiting for a army of niggers.
Among the five sums seven children.
After the Vancouver Concert, the group will act in California (US), in San José ( on 4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid, they will act on 23 December.
New fears about the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing debate on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of exporting fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every race between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev warned that if Moscú increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous debate last year cleaned the supplies to EU states.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscú came with the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state, the monopolic duty of gas, Gazprom, trying to accept the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that it would cover more in Ukraine, since it has been commitmented to pay 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from the Neighbourhood of Turkey.
Analysts say that it may be that Ukraine pays 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It's important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transactions during conversation," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters News Agency.
"Gas price changes should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [Occidental Europe] through Ukraine."
The last major debate on the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This means a fall in exports to Western Europe, which has soon led to prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reservations in the world, but a lot of it is not yet completely developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkmenistan's gas and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "he should test for foreign workers"
The Swedish NHS needs to control the criminal previous records of employees outside Europe, said a supervisor.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came after verification that a foreign doctor was related to the attack of Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Swedish NHS had no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel with which account.
His report, however, noted other controls that were correctly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor held the amount of foreign personnel contracted outside the European Economic Area, due to the attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Royal Alexandre Hospital of Paisley, was arrested in the airport after shocking a jeep in the doors of the terminal airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of the cases attacked with car bombs in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out the pre-employment chains for candidates to ensure that they comply with qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
While the Scotia Health Association uses "Disclosure Scotia" to carry out criminal controls, the Agency has no legality to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, inter alia, that the joints should contain the guideline of the Criminal Records Office, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"If we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a rutinary review," says the report.
Black declares that the Skow NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes: "In our report the areas that can be improved in order to ensure that information is available in the number of foreign personnel of NHS."
The President of the BMA Scotia, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "so much likely" that pre-emple cheques can identify potential NHS employees that could do terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-emple cheques operate in Scotia but is not clearly the value added from the recommendations made," explained.
Scotch health authorities declare that they currently account for 1.161 foreign people, most of their medical and nurses
However, the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, in part because the joints have problems to identify what are the employees who have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the control procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were widely fulfilled.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification cheque.
The Swedish Government is currently revising the policy and guide for foreigners in NHS.
The Health Secretariat, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "I had a great interest in carrying out this work on the basis of the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that, together with health gatherings, the Swedish Government could consider the report recommendations and that this will be reflected in the update of pre-emple control guides for all working groups, including foreigners, which were expected to publish the next month.

Venus could have been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists last night.
The data of a European space ship in orbit showed the planet most like a gem of the Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth.
The two planets have similar size and take similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
For millions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to those who made a living planet from the earth, now scientists believe.
But the effects of the carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmosphere over the sun radiations and the slowest sun rotation sent to Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet does not have water, the temperature of the surface is enough to throw the plume and is erosionate by the swimming winds and ray torments.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for one year, offer a view of how the Earth can develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physicals of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, states: "The climate is clear because Venus is so different from the earth when two so similar planets are.
"We new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus started as the Earth, possibly with a living environment for millions of years."
Police Deputy uranium enriched
A kilo of radiation material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was decommitted last night by the Slovakian and Hungary police.
A police porter declared that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The effect could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said that it could have been sold by $1 million (480,000 sterlin library).
You're still open
Mitt Romney says that it is not honourable that the candidates answer the questions of a swimming monkey.
However, the Republicn candidates for the presidency may be allowed to keep a debate on YouTube, where common and flowing voters record video questions and send them for their dissemination between candidates.
None of the questions presented on Thursday 28 November were more rigid than the sneemon that asked the democrats about the climate calentization in the debate of the Republic of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this very much of the state of the Republican party on the elections of the next year.
We do not know exactly how CNN producers, who co-patronize the debate, have chosen YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half-hour debate, the longest dedicated to one theme, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicns.
CNN requested an indecisive voter group to go on the dialogue when they listened to ideas that they would like: the employees noted a bit of approximation when candidates talked with extremist arguments.
The most hardest words exchanged between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, which has been pointed out in the critical Iwa and New Hampshire surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney because it was broken with illegal immigration when he was at New York's Chamber.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former ruler of Massachusetts to contract illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they asked whether a candidate could support an "amnist" (which let illegals regulate their situation and give them the opportunity to get the citizenship).
The smaller candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congress, agreed with the topic.
No one has the word to be called a candidate, but both remain in the car, perhaps because they both warned about the theme of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased monitoring in borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This subject, along with the fear of the toxic games in China and other concerns for the outside, helps the Republicns to forget or minimize the divisions between liberalians and Christian conservators.
But the debate was unpleasant when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he supported the arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water invasion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to strive to the position that, although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally in the story of Jonas and the ballon.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -ahora, against all expectations, first in Iowa's recent survey, thanks to his long-term Christian conservation - said that death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pressed to answer if Jesus would be favorable, the rider said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be a candidate in the elections.
The car is still open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, in accordance with the liberal Ron Paul's fund recovery campaigns, and its appreciative statements on Sunday debate.
They have gone from the back, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the previous and convinced party with a winner message on the size of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is shared and the result is far off to be clear.
Workers
Gordon Brown has discovered another day in which he was haming; but it also emerges
As political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It seems not to have sold influences, nor is it exorbiting hotel accounts in Paris, nor shoes of extramare teeth.
However, a rich businessman has disrupted contributions to the English laboratory party, more than 650,000 stern libraries (1,3 million dollars), for about four years using false names, and the party did not condemn it.
Two months ago, when the first minister learned to call a election, strictly insulting the British intellectuality, declaring that the opinion surveys did not influence its decision, hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democracy leads to growing engineer, because the feared Mr. Brown has been Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in trouble, has demonstrated regulatory deficiency and justice poverty at times of crisis.
Nearly proposals for amending the Tax Code have taken to the entrepreneurial groups together against the Government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an immaginable administrative chaussure.
One triumph of the retreated generals started a motor in the Lores camera, protesting against the courts in the military expenditure: serving the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the workers secretariat (and previously compiled) has already diminished.
Nothing about this means that Mr. Brown spends irrevocablely to the outdoor.
Governments can reach an infringement point after their ability to rule.
People do not believe them as political, but normally suspend their incredibity when a new struggle is controlling.
Once it is clear that the first minister is not able to improve the things, which isn't still much time, that suspension is more: public officials start to fall; office ministers are exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government is put on the defence and does not focus.
In one part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by argumenting that it is new.
Although I would like to reject Tony Blair, it was his top tennis.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registering tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as a skiller.
And yet, when it is not directly engaged in Blairish's contractuals - or "efficient for partners", research on the financing of political parties - voters may assume that if it is.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not so bad as it seems.
The plates are not so bad as the Tories wants to show.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died, nor has he been sent directly.
And the remedie, although painful, is to give what the naturally stalinist trends of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandale of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his blessing.
This may be that, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against the anonymed for large political contributions are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those with power.
Mr. Watt, who said about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fund recovery to him asking about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved until now: there is nothing that he would suggest that he knew of these actions, although the slowness of payments was made after he would take control of the office in June.
Eventually, the first minister has done half of the work.
It has been fast to condemn its party because of violating the law, but it is divided into decisions for a family matter, a investigation committee on the matter - conducted, in good measure, by a judge and a obispo.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law was violated, it's a police matter.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, as to find a permanent and independent leader for the Commission of Standards in the Public Life, because he has not had one since six months and should also press for a real reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a hard work of workers with the Tories, and may be a renumber to the special financial situation that is with the trade unions - amargaging measures for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The conservators now have a good level of support in the surveys; he has two years to win voters; and the only way that you can move to victory is in action with an unexpected probability and solid competition.
Card tickets
Is the crisis of subpress hypotheses infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there are blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal alerts are emocioned around.
Today that the United States living market is in crisis, depressors have their sights on the country market of credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that losses in credit cards can be reached by $99 million if the hypothesis crisis is subtracted to other forms of consumption credit.
Contact signs are already seen.
There is a increase in card charges and crime rates, which measures the percentage of salts that have not been affected or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it took 1.4 million charges in its financing business to the American consumer, in part because of the deficiency of card providers.
However, it's very early for the panic.
Morousity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical media.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American Chief Law (2005) made place to a cut down in the requests of sweet, which represents a great loss of credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, morosity) would be grown again, or may happen that the conditions for the providers were delaying.
The industry also reports slight payment rates, which shows how many of its debts pay consumers each month.
And trust in credit cards and values supported by assets is sufficiently strong, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a investigator sign, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be approximately 25% higher than last year.
The direct crisis infection channels between subpress hypotheques and the credit card market are certainly available: consumers like to load credit card debts since credit firms are falling.
But credit card employees view more the liquidity flow than the active values, so that the fall prices do not necessarily take a change in the credible capacity of providers.
They may even work to adventure employers.
The encouragement to consumers to continue to love the hypothesis decrease whether the properties value less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card falls on the list of priorities.
Card emissions can also respond rapidly and flexiblely to the difficult conditions that hipotech providers, changing types of interest or changed creditor salts.
This should reduce the risk of rapid retailment of assets in the theory.
"We're not going to wake up a day and we're not gonna evaluate all the loans", says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Financial Chief.
If a slowly infection of the subpress on the market of credit cards is impossible, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction involves the recession to America, the industry is indudly a more severe future.
There must be a monitoring of those dorsal sweet smells.
British banks declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers who were judicially judged for their responsibilities in fraud with the former Chief of Enron’s Financial Office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty of this Monday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent seven fraud charges by spending with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich employees' costs.
They were sent to court in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each one was sentenced as a fraud complainant.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a Skot PLC unit in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures for two years.
In the United States, his case marks the final flow of an investigation launched after Enron's slaughter in 2001.
Initially, banking charges were to have warned in 2002 to Fastow that aimed at a government investigation on Enron's fall.
The accused of bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claimed that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Enron society controlled by Fastow, which was the artistic of a miracle of frauds in Enron, which helped his shoot shut in the crystal.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British people knew that it would be higher.
A company under the control of Kopper purchased the subsidiary bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper for interests in that company.
According to the accused, Fastow was falsely representing Enron because the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British banks, Fastow and others.
The bankers covered 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accused accused.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced for two conspiration charges in Enron's failure.
The triumph of Britishs was arrested three months later.
Fastow is doing a 6-year-old sentence in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is fulfiling a 3-year penalty and one month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British banks must pay $1 million that requested to live in the United States while the judgment was held.
Enron, one of the seven larger companies of the country, declared in routine in December 2001 after years of trucks in accountability, could not hide the debt of millions or make it possible to make its business successful.
The fall had lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive leader, Jeffrey Skilling were charged by kings last year for their roles in the failure of the company.
Skilling is doing a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conspiration, fraud and other charges were suspended when he died from a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and enough fuel capacity to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts with $54 million.
But this is a small expenditure for some of the rich Russians.
"You have capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one requests this model of so many seats because it is for family private flights or for a company's presidents."
Mr. Fireer was responsible for the Gulfstream chain last Wednesday at the Millennium Feria, a 4-day consumption body held in a centre of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, other 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, expecting to attract new Russians to all kinds of products, from cooked yachts to the diamonds incompared, with 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks slightly a brilliant Porsche on the nearest stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and caldery compared to us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital appears to Dallas when he was in a pharmaceutical position.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some academic Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists", says Marshall Goldman, professor of the Centre Davids for Russian and Euro-Asian studies at the Harvard University.
"Come the healthy ones of the 70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the largest consumers and hosts of the world."
The most exclusive luxury marks in the world are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another place of Moscow, this week will be held a conference on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxury goods in Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owner of the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billion multinationals that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Furthermore, the second level of riches includes 103.000.000 Russians whose money arrives to $670 million, according to a study of the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, written by economics of the Centre for Economic and Finance Research, a local thanksgiving idea.
(World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of the Russians were located under the sustainability level.)
"There are hundreds of thousands in Moscow - and so we are all here", says Nicole Marais, vendor representative of David Morris, the London joyer.
She attended the holiday for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are unexpectedly prepared and men are very dignity."
Visiting the Sunday's night, clothes in afternoon, two root goods agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and their own as a thousand.
"Share the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reelted out the design clothing that used as a network veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The holiday aims to attract the new riches, the type of buyers that would be ready to stay several hours in a store that mixes marks from Cadillac Scalades, platinum cortaples, Mövenpick helmets, shipping pool tables, apartments in Dubai and gund's bones.
The public can buy bottles of 30 euros ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what is the most costful and best mark," said Mr. Gijrath, who felt patriotically in a state of the Dutch real Porcelanas Delft, before a mural reconstruction of a Rembrandt's painting painting, pinted in the hand.
"Certainly, Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
Indeed, the salers said that the richer Russians for more trayectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their enjoyments from the calling logs to the limited edition marks, which would not be exposed to a commercial feast.
However, several thousands of people: thousands in effectiveness, missionaries of the millenniums or tourists are filled with the passes every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first evening of the holiday, Roman Ershov, director-General of the beds King Koil, said that he sold two $70,000 cotton systems each one, seat, swimming, and gold swimming alcohol.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, who was charged to sell for A1 Moto, company with high gamma cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said that the company had sold the brilliant slightly anaranjaged Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian milliard.
By Sunday afternoon, André Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, company who changes luxury cars for special requirements, said that he had sold three cars with a chain bracelet for Rolls Royce Phantom, $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car route designed for a Russian casin, with rays incomposed of Swarovski color cristals, so that it would be assigned to a ruleta route.
The cost: $22,000 for four roofs.
"The Russian millionary who wants avestructuring core routines or a recrat of his wife made of zirconium cubes, it will not necessarily drive on those routes," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, with the other 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian believes that the "Russian millionary" word does not mean exclusiveity, given the oil of prices of real estate properties.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millennium, at least in the paper if it is not effective," said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who weren't thousands could at least finish being rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian signing of assets.
The company made four red phone chains (Britanic style) filled with false thresholds of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing officer, said that his team had printed 500,000 false to the Millennium Fear.
Visitors stopped shootting money piles, asking their friends to get photos with their mobiles while they rested over a lot of money, or spend a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionary," says Karriev.
"chapuza" surgery could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little more healthy" and he saw how a ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two lower doors in West Scott Avenue.
Soon, there was a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"So you're going up the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Sunday.
"There was when I knew someone died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo of 41 years of age, who assisted the Director of the Police Department of Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a non-autorised plastic surgery, which is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the 212 house of the West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what has caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they expect to toxicological test, although the results are not available to some weeks, and it will help solve the mysterious death that has reached at the top of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant from the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was family to many in the Department.
"It was loyal, worker and tenaz," Mr. McCarthy said about Arroyo in a telephone interview.
"It was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former officer of Newark, who worked for the Commission on the Control of Alcohol Bebés, and left two children of 14 and 11 years of age, and one daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a copy of the Condado Union fiscal, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died due to an unlawful surgery procedure.
"This is one of the possibilities," Walsh stated.
"It's a current research."
The authorities said they had reached the house around 3 p.m.
From 21 November and found Ms. Arroyo in a sofa.
It was declared dead at the place.
It has been over a week, and the authorities haven't said about their investigation or house office, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh couldn't tell if Mrs Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door in the house of Mrs Castro, where a marked rock is located in the front of the house, and a dragard laid on the back.
A blue tank labeled as "ethyl vagina" - used as a substitute for food and perfumes - was found on the door of the cart, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two mountain bikes skills on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she came to Newark after 25 years in the police department of New York, Ms. Arroyo was an inestimable help to know the new island city and its political road.
She would say, "You have to monitor with this or with that," she said.
" She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's pregnant."
The federal reservation is expected to correct the rates to upgrade the Bolsa
The actions slaughtered both sides of the Atlantic last after the market expected that the Federal Reserve calms the credit conditions with the interest rates, which increased with the tranquillious comments of the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank.
The bags were shocked in London, New York and through Europe after Donald Kohn, two numbers of Ben Bernanke President, stated that policy factors should be "flexibility and pragmatic" to respond to the continuous stress of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to tranquillize the markets through growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "in part of market improvement at the end of September and October".
If I would continue to continue upward trends, I would increase the possibility of additional adjustments within the financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is listed to inject fresh capital on the US markets and to make later cuts of the type of interest, to establish credit conditions.
observations also helped to calm Wall Street through bad news for the U.S. economy, such as household sales that reached the lower record in October.
The results of the financial turbulence were highlighted by an advertisement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank to cover 650 jobs, which equals 4 per cent of its total work, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the losses of their investment in the sub-prior hypothetics of the United States.
Only 20 of these posts are in London, where the bank is employed to 1.500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones was 331 points, or 2.55%, closed to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 is up to 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 was 165.5 points, or 2.7%, closed to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 million sterlin libraries to the value of the first order companys in Britain.
Germany's index was 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was more than 2.3%.
Before, it was highlighted the recurrence of the credit pressure on the markets after a strong demand in a fund ratio to three months of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds in the value markets in London was stressed the credit and rates of the "Libor" loans for three months between the British banks, which means the higher rate since September, of 6.59%, after a continuing leasing from 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemas, each one is so hard as the other.
Who must shoot No. 6 by England in Candy this weekend, Owees Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important towards the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in the special title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain to decide; and also because the officer of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth bathroom will be unfortunate, but life often is injust and sports too.
It is not easy to take what a man does in the top of his profession, while the other never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by capacity.
The election is not only difficult in the cricket, because it is necessary for judgments that are always undergoing.
Is it the right time to Bopara get up?
Is it just for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be done in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good-level levels and that they well know the business, would be promoted to the table: there is only one place for one of them.
Who should say what's a good level for a cricket player, unless it gives you the opportunity to shoot or smile the next chance?
The figures, of course, have a great influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.
In a team, a cricket player must take the eye of the captain at the same time to take a "wicket" and a battery to get the opportunity to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player any day.
But capture the eye of the selectioners is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past time, for example, James Anderson, who plays safely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared for "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first kits in 33 cars for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had its high moments and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiria Stadium may only be a question of view.
The option may break or make a man's car or may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and made it well in the first, with 5 kits and 40 useful carriage, but Paul Collingwood was struggling to set up at the same time that came to become an important player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia, it may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at the today's session at the Asgiria Stadium, will follow its conservation instincts and will favour Shah's best experience for the outcome of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is its brilliant and valuable testing of the 88 debut in Bombay, 32 centuries of first class before only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years older, and has excellent fronts against the spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten carriages in his two tours in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan called his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something elan in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joy to live in swords.
He takes nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarised as when he flyed his vehicle in an exhibition for the English car patronator, Volkswagen.
He suffered less importance and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out of his Vodaphone (patrocinated, of course) and to call Alastair Cook, his team partner that looked at the distance, to tell him with excitation: "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, you are included your rebalance step to have effects on your games that seem to be satisfied, because it bathes with confidence and ability.
Select the right man is one thing, choose the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the true art of the selection.
My inclination would give Bopara your opportunity, which does not mean that Shah doesn't overcome, as they suggest the tea sheets, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first bus with Syrian refugees began to arrive to Bagdad yesterday, expulsing the exiles that remained without effectiveness, without expansion of the visa and who expected that the city returns to normality.
Some even had returned to fight against warriors that led them out of their homes.
In Mansour's bus station, even before 800 people from Damasco arrived in a official port of the government composed of a twelve of bus, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," says Sabah al-Qubasi, Sunday doctor.
"I returned today to what I saw on the TV and what I read in the magazines, about what happened in Bagdad and that is safe now."
"He said that the army of Mahdi left killing people," said, referring to the chief militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentum cease.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old-old teacher in Amariah's sun zone, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime did not want Iraqi working in his country.
His neighbors in Amariyah called him on a phone to tell him that a membership of the United States helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion to the west of the capital, and they called it to return.
One of the recently arrived from Jordan was the chief of a Sunday and Chita tribe that had been conducted from their home to Sleikh to the north of Bagdad, by a grain attack, after he urged the citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Third two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a Military Anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my companions."
"There is why I came back today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi said, 62 years old.
Many have said to be taken by the growing calm in the capital since the United States troops engaged in groups of armed citizens, and working in cooperation with the United States militarys to defend their neighbors.
But many declared that they had returned to the degradation of the visa and the lack of money in Damasco, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi were established in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years of age and father of three children, urged the common suspicion between the exiles, Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chief minister, requested the Syrian government to impose restrictions to refugees' views to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have gone out of the country because of the sectile death quarters.
"We were well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to let the Iraqi faces to force them back to Iraq," said the Sunday.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my home after I left her."
It is part of the reason for the stop of violence that the Sunitas have been excluded from the Chinese and vice-seven areas, relaxing the tension.
There is fear that a oiled swift of refugees will re-establish secular tensions and start struggling.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even brilliant by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Syrians only have a educational field.
"Here I explained by fifty times to a non-Sirlandian who isn't French" - that was the iranic motive on himself from the smallest federal state for its fifty-year state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system, which in a study of the Almanian Economy Institute (IW) called "Implanter" occupied the fifth place.
Thus, higher schools in tradition have good relationship with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was funding in 1948 by French.
To this day, students can end their university care with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in high schools.
"In the Sarre the professional education system is used", says Axel Plunnecke, the educational experts in the Almanian Economy Institute (IW).
More than five young people make their bachillate at the Professional School, so that Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety is very wide.
The offering of dual carriages, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of ingenieurs in Engineering sciences has declined a third in the past few years.
That was the reason why the Minister for Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more advertising for intellectual sciences.
"On the first study of PISA, we have made some reforms in general education schools", states a portal of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the Government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order that children start to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this has no cost, but this model also imitate the other federal states.
The comparison with the following studies will show whether it has increased the performance of students.
According to the PISA report of 2003, the number of students late in school development was 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, Sarre did not improve much as other federal states.
In Baviera, students know how to calculate better.
To disappoint the Syrians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of the foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Syrians are not French, the language of neighbors is a binding assignment in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Try to change the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another hour different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez left to change the time in South America by delaying the average hour.
Currently, Chávez is as a comic in Spain.
As noted by the Official Bulletin of the Venice State, according to the new law, the hour will pass at least four hours.
Thus, the South American country will have an hour shock that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as a enemy of the United States, justifys its decision by saying that the United States will take the world's obligation to change a full time.
In addition, the Monday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with its neighbouring Colombia because of the action of rehens.
The left nationalist said that it would not keep any relationship with the chief of State, or with the Colombian government until Alvaro Uribe would continue to be President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do", said Chavez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be sufficiently expanded in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe when removing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the marxist guerrille in which it was the release of the troops.
Sunday, Chávez criticized that the decision taken by Uribe has violated Venezuela.
Also, in Spain it is much about Chavez.
A new ton of call causes feeling in the country: "Why do you not walk?" is the phrase that already downloaded a half million people.
This phrase declared the king of Spain that was angry for the continued interruptions by the left populations at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the reduction of the real wage threats to the Germans.
According to a prognostic, this year a reduction in the real wage threats to German employees, despite a strong conjunction.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessist prognostic.
As calculated by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should contain in 2007 with a real salary account lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of salaries, increased tax on the value added and the style of food and energy prices," reported the "Image" of the Macroeconomic Institute and Research Institute of Economic cycles.
New unemployment insurance loads may also correspond to employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück said to the newspaper "New Ostanbrücker Zeitung", which was given to the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance load of a 3.3% over one year to another, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office must not be put again in a unpleasant situation, requesting credits and subsidies to the Federal State, in accordance with the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
In March, the inflation rate of price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivative sector had reached the highest level for 13 years.
In comparison with the prices last year, these are increased by 3 %.
Venus: A gemele brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most like the Earth, something that has not yet been drawn up. The European "Venus Express" survey has discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolinns in the pools, the same things that appear in the winter on the earth.
For three decades, the investigators were suspected that they could exist radars in Venus.
But now the European survey has brought new tests: he discovered electrical waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call a height of 54 km from a cloud and behind another, the account of Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Natura".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on the earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on their part, had originated amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus isn't that: if any day had lived there, that would be in one of the first evolution states," Sean Solomon explains the Carnegie Institute of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus can not have life: atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times higher than the earth and on the surface regnates temperatures of 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Thankly, Venus is a gemele "diabetic" of the earth, but it is still a gemele," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, such as the Earth for its masses and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the ninety-five had no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The last results of the investigations that will be presented in many "Natura" articles, according to the investigators' opinion, are not only stressed by Venus' unity in the Solar system.
"This also shows that neighbor planets have more common features with the Earth of which we had certainly been", reports the ESA.
Despite the slowly known winds in North Pool, researchers found in the Polar region also a voltice formed by the clouds that turns faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high earthquakes of the pools, according to a team of researchers of Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Astrophysics and Space Physical Institute.
The second planet of the Solar system has almost the mass equal to the Earth and its equivalent diameter of 12.000 km results almost so large.
This planet also called alba star or evening star around the sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmosphere pressure of 92 bars is not much at the Earth, scientists are part of the basis that both planets had been formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets, water was gloomed on the earth in the oceans, but in Venus was discovered in the universe.
While the carbon dioxide was converted into carbon stones on the earth, in Venus the majority of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's mixture with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties by receiving Dalai Lama in the Federal Chairmanship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for his attacks to the Federal Canciller after the mitin in September.
Horst Koehler, Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany, and therefore requested the great coalition to end this fight for Dalai Lama's receipt.
"In this case, we should not present us as a separate UNA nation," said Koehler to the journal "Handelsblatt " .
At the same time, Koehler showed its understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Angella Merkel (Part of the Democratic Union) in September.
"I have a great respect to the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely responsibilities for me," said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with a great balance in putting out external policy, stressing the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that he received in the implementation of a new policy with China.
"The Federal Canceller did not take the distance of the traditional China policy course.
China also knows it," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had shown its disappointment indirectly due to the receipt of Dalai Lama and was attacked by the EU members.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative policy in external matters.
The receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancillery caused great understanding in the Chinese-aleman relations.
Thus, the Chinese government did not only retire the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), Germany's Minister of Finance, but also, according to the information sources of the Spiegel magazine, conversed the called strategic dialogue of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chief of China, requested the Federal Canceller Angela Merkel to recognize this receipt of Dalai Lama as a error.
On the basis of China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of Tibethans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that they are trying to share the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Shaeuble warns that disorders such as those occurred in France will be caused.
Battles with the police on the streets, fires, shoots: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disorders will be caused as the case of France.
The Federal Minister requires that the social insatisfaction in Germany may not be transferred to streets.
The Vandalians shooted with police shooting: after serious disorders protagonized by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Interior Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Part of the Democratic Union) fear similar trends in Germany.
"We have to set up TAMBIEN that the social problems of our country do not take the violence."
"We have to take it seriously," said the newspaper "New Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all youths are developed in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Shaeuble.
This is not only the integration of immigrants.
"Dead of the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already given its first fruits."
It's still early to sit down the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs have no same construction and sociologue problems as happening in France.
Young people had serious disorders on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, the public cars and buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, requested more efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Colat, in view of disorders in France, warns an imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the parity index between young people of foreign origin under 25 years is above the average.
There are more jobs in vocational training.
"We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that there is more social control in Germany than in France, than the French country.
Furthermore, most of the young people from foreign origin did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
"But, however, we have to be careful."
Young people must “provide the opportunity to receive more faster job or vocational training.”
While the evening in the parish suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police were involved in the action, a helicopter with doing so overcoming the territory.
The responsible authorities informed three arrests, as well as shooting cars and shooting cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police are employed by security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Internal Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures so far as necessary.
Wednesday night about 80 police were damaged by disorders in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disorders continued next night in Tolouse.
The disorder began by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the information provided by the fiscality, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Canciller shows that coalition on content has come to its last point and that there is no need to expect anything more than it.
But in what country really lives the Canciller?
After its unexpected, unreasonable and unreasonable action in the general debate of the Baja House, it must be said: it is not living in the country that it would have to be ruled by it.
The Canciller rejected it with a presumable phrase on the reproof that he had been reiterately dedicated to external policies.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what is interested in the critics.
In the Baja House, it was very clearly declared to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
I couldn't feel any interest, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead of that, Angela Wolke was presented in this way: a very high policy that flees in the external policy and remains there without a concrete achievement.
An example: prevention of climate change: it has been much blessed by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but he does not say anything about how these objectives should be achieved here in climate matters.
In general, this way, for two years, is the chief of the Democratic Union Party has not been allowed so modesty.
So it is put into expressions so that people have a impulse.
And in this way, it damages its public image by the pragmatic concept with which it resolves the problems without going to the rames.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, the internal problems are low-value appearances.
The poverty of children and the concerns for workers with low salary?
The only dedication is to speak about this topic using under-ordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong when it is about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a more or less good phrase.
It started to "come if it had been on an unknown territory" when it was more concrete information.
The section of attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a valuable debate on YouTube presidential precautions and should now be afraid only a candidate to the outside.
The tensions between candidates are already noted since the beginning.
Mitt Romney reproved his adversary Rudy Giuliani that this would have converted to New York to "a refugee site for illegal immigrants".
He replied with serious reproachs: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegal." Julian responded to the former Governor of Massachusetts, saying that he was who had employed illegal immigrants without role.
Candidates have attacks: as until now the Republican group does not have a clear favour, the eight presidential precautions use the debate in the CNN, especially to disfellowship their opposers.
The small videos of 30 seconds, rounded by Internet users that were sent to Youtube, also have much content.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler reach the power", was John McCain's rebellion to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meetings that insisted to immediately retire the Iraqi troops.
Romney is also criticized by the veterans of the war in Vietnam when it refuses to recognise the " Waterboarding " (Waterboarding) as a questionnaire method, letting a person get to death simultaneously.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are not only the war in Iraq or the discussions on torture.
The public has always expressed a strong appeal when they swallowed the conservative values and refused the slowdown of taxes.
So you can better see where the deficiencies of both favorites are.
"In that time I was wrong," Romney acknowledged and asked for forgiveness to people and the television public for being abortion defender in 1994.
Giuliani did not know what to say when they asked him what I thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf gobernae without uniform.
One day after his departure as the chief of the army, the President of Pakistan was swearing as President.
This ends the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Jubilee Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took a plea for a second 5-year-old mandate.
The Pakistani television directly transmitted the ceremony to the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf pleaded to respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
Thursday, his army chief mandate was transferred to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after the power would be done with an incredible military shock, the former general of the state was the first time as civil leader.
With his renunciation to the Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf complied with the main condition of opposition and western.
The other requirement is the end of the State of Exemption, which was declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the general fiscal of the state, after the Moharraf jürry, the State's exceptional status will soon annul the state of exemption and meet the second condition of the West.
Since the Supreme Court was proclaimed an exceptional state in the Supreme Court, there were many party judiciary in Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the new elections of the head of the Government on 6 October.
While, in an attention to an army port in the North Watistan region, five soldiers died, and four other were assaulted.
According to the army porter, a bomb was explosed in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Return the founders of Krautrock.
The famous German band of the 70s continued to work: three "harmonia" members participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reestreno was a copy of "Live 1974", which was written at the best time of the band.
They were already very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three ladies to an official food caused feelings.
Each of them has their cages, cables, and above all their boots.
In the middle, he sits Deter Moebius who has 63 years of age and is clothed with a white shop.
His left is Michael Rother of 57 years of age, who has his portable computer and guitar.
Right, looking at the audit, Hans-Joachim Rodelius is 73 years old, which is very occupied with the control panel.
Each one contributes with its sounds, among them there are even rhythms.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It looks like this doesn't hurt the ladies.
Something very comfortable for Krautrock's appointments was the fact that the Harmonia band returned to make music.
What we need to rebuild here is the following: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band was back into the mind of people, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public would be so strange.
But why the Germans can not also enjoy their live legend in the seventy years?
In particular, because the Equiptor Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" music prize to the members of the Can 2003 band in Colombia for his life work, in the room it was possible to see the surprises of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and New! band, they all opened the mouth with amazing.
Later, Michael Rother passed time in the scenario during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been a old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in his country and recognition in the foreign is one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the triumph has only existed two years and in those times I have not achieved a great impact on the public, but I have received it later thanks to others.
For a long time Moebius and Roedelius had music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of famous.
At first they touched in the village of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf, who was patronized by a church.
During a time, Rother had an energetic worker and then worked as a guitarist in the New band! He made it possible to improve the famous German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a ruin of the 17th century, lived as refugees of the city.
The life mode was less ideological than in the Common I, where Roedelius could have been required from his position.
That was better a life of an artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day a band of Harmonia song association of Ottenstein was found in the pool, which resulted in being a good name for art.
There were also devenge in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music from Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as artist was not only to meet himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Greece. Somebody remembers that almost 50 people were involved in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propulse Harmonia and to do again when tests.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the habitats.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother ended into the subjects of esoterism and ensured its existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighth years, and since that time he had more success than I had Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Griessmer, that's what you need to thank Greenemeyer.
Your Greenland music company was designed to cultivate this German own contribution to maintain her as life music.
Like Roedelius' work, also the New band! was again discovery.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band is placed in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidied with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Dr. Motte, the Loveparade manufacturer.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock on the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-bando, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase associated with the special music filles the room: "This music is the only true music, she belongs to the future."
There are pictures where Harmonia appears with producers in a fat.
The history of Legend's development is shown in the designs of white and black photos, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterans who started to reprove again.
They do nothing more than fixing microphones to the organ and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of effect devices that had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is like it should be.
Three people who deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenster's address, in a musical environment, it smells, and in a good moment of enthusias is sing "Aaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never a rock.
It was not searched for gender origin in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by fleeing from the art and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here crys "68!" also has right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
In the scenario it is very well reflected on what is already clear.
Where's it starting and where's the music ending?
This can break one the nerves or give a fast moment of luck.
Richard Gere's only lacking cynism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Morderical Peace" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two weren't very convinced.
Or the concepts are very fixed in actions and shoots, or the two films are too emocioning.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can not help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but exactly there, in the dark inside of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was recovered again.
Finally, we had lost view of the slightest man in the 80s, because nobody wanted to see him after his pleasant and little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the film "The Hunting Party - when a caster becomes what he perseveres" (Why today the titles of the films must be so long and shooted?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, his role of reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and industry of the cinema hadn't been so mercy with him. He was a man whose best times of life had already occurred, that as a monument of the destruction of his decade had to remain until now the majority of his attraction.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with "Morderère Peace" which is German production and will also be presented this week, results in only a series of films without success on war in the Balkans.
It can be narrowed by the film "Moerderère Peace" in a few words: this is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of Kosovo francotirators, one of them acts very fast, and that also leads to her love.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shooters, although we celebrate that Serbias are not submitted once again as the only guiltable.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fire Cobra 11" without autopsy, but in war situation.
The Hunting Party can be investigated, because there was never a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and another guyon author (Richard Shepard in two charges), the history of the US reporters in the war that will be to detect a criminal war serbia called "sorcer", probably might be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are amazingly similar: the small teams go two times to the mountain to carry out something that can't do the army, and each time it comes to an unclean journey.
A reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning they present us to Simon Hunt, whom he does not let it be just a cine with heart.
No, the guide also provides a lovely adventure with a Muslim bosnia that will kill her later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when in the past five minutes the reporters with a prestigious rapidity achieved what they couldn't achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the head casters of the world, which was captured the war crime and left them to the Muslim Bosnians to be in a fair way.
It's so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court in the Hague based on crimes against cinema logical.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deep human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadśi and Mladiś are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really worried to follow them because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so that one comes to his head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of a Asian demon: "In the great sights of his front, shareing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that hard is being good.
The problem is not only the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Shortly in a newspaper published that all the films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fascinated.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Always there is a rule: when a star is placed by a crisis region or by the mines fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Other the other part of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Denners of blood" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts occurred in a short time space.
They have to pass at least decades until Hollywood runs a good film on the holocaust, holding the film "The List of Schindler".
Some films have already needed more time. Classic works like war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Fulll Metal Jackett" in their times were not one-time celebrated by master works.
Today, we may be too sit too much about global conflicts, and therefore in our time every killing (Massenmord) is presented directly in two home televisions.
And that's because the guion authors do not have the smallest recurrence (which is necessary for power) to smell good stories.
"Sir or not be" or "The great dictator" resulted at the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not even know that so bad was actually the nazi regime.
Maybe it shouldn't be a good person to roll a movie.
Perhaps it must be like the newslist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant view of a artist.
When they asked him about the paralelisms between his new historical "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he said, "This should only be to some things never changed."
The large cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and in Yugoslavia will always reigne war.
From Beaust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
Hambourg harbour received many critics from policy and economics because of not requesting the Olympic Games in the summer.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sport section.
But Beaust remembers that it must be realistic when evaluating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Trade Camera, expressed this renumber as "not good for economic loan".
Last time no other project in the great city promoted such motivation as the idea of the organization of Olympic Games.
"If this goal could not be maintained by the political impulse, I was sporting at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz requested the senate not to forget this project, but found a new long-term application "what refers to another time".
On Monday, Ole van Beaust observed its statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of Sommer Olympic Games were not performed at least 2028.
"Hambourg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides the Almanian Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
He sent the decision of the Sporting Federation (Sportbond) which was expected at the beginning of December on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of Winter 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, that until now we thought we had up to 2028, from realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity."
Despite all, this dream did not end forever, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regrets the von Beut statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to ask the Olympic Games.
"It's too early to leave the opportunity, if the plans are now broken", said the Sunter Ploß, director of HSB.
A rejection of the request is contradictory to the statement of the senator who made it in a receipt due to the general meeting of the German Public Federation for Sports of High Schools (adh).
There van Beaust designed the request from Hamburg for universities in 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sport Federation of High Schools named Hamburg as a candidate to the request.
The German Social-Democratic Party Group (SPD-Bürgerschafts Fraction) repressed the senate that he would not use such a valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"As many years the senate delayed with the development of the small barrier of Grasbrook, because it was plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputy of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the building houses, the DDC stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg for the Olympic Games in the summer 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the kayu cake. I need it.
Who relates to Sweden's terms and wood box, thinks in Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
The wood boxes currently produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighting on the Warhol work list.
Most of the ninety and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, the modern Museum of Stockholm performed internal investigations and arrived to deceptive conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Museo Pontus Hultén gave to the modern Museum, are false, and almost one hundred of the other "Stocolmo type", which are in circulation on the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and patrocinated productions.
In 1964 Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the red, blue and white wood boxes with the same sample that they had jabón powder cards "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of its works of 1968 in the modern Museum, hundreds of card cards were exposed. These did not warhol (for expenditure), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" card factory.
It was not art works, but examples (which was only some of the objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce a few wood boxes in Sweden but were not exposed to the Modern Museum.
The Witnesses of those times now speak that almost 15 boxes, which in that time entered into the history of art and substate as the original "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased for more than $1000,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén would make false statements that in Sweden in 1968 were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the tree boxes that Warhol left them to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö to Hultén and for exhibition in San Petersburg.
In this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the leader of the modern Museum conservators, invested six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First, they were printed and exploded their swimming plates and then painted them to the oil with the pincel.
On the contrary, the structure of the copy of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a routine without printing directly the cutting plates. Furthermore, it is not the painting of oil, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of the modern Museum, and adds that if the Commission of Authentication "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not reach any conclusion, the modern Museum will classify these six boxes such as the copy/objects of exposure."
In July, the Commission of Authentication announced formally that it accepted these "grave accused" in which it is jabon powder boxes.
But since that time, everything remained absolutely silent.
