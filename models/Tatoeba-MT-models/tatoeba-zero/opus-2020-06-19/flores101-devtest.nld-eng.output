Gold can be edited to many forms. It can be opgered in small forms.
It can be cut into a small strip that can be draged and fleet. It can also be mixed or gered in plates.
After it has been completely made, it can be placed on another metal. It can even be made so douled that sometimes for the switching of handed illustrations was used in books that are called 'refined manuscripts'.
This is the pH value of a chemical substance. You already make a indicator using red cold samp.
Then the color of the coal samp changes on the basis of the acid grain (azul to base or alkalic) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated on the basis of the quantity of hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemically tested substance.

When you call someone who is on thousands of miles away, you can use a satellite.
When the space satellite receives the call, this is immediately returned.
The satellite is the space shooted by a raket. Scientists make in the space use of telescopes because the earth's shoes forms a part of our light and image.
To reach a satellite or telescoop in the space, you must have a large raket that is over 30 meters long.
The chil has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing he gave us is a simpler and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other vehicles are the result.
There are disasters of the average size between the prooi of medium sizes, from hair to antipasses and herbs.
Furthermore, there are many small kitchens (such as swimming cats that are held as a household) who kisse smaller prooies, such as insects, kids, hairs, and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that has every cat that does not competite with others.
Leahs are the most social chats and lives in large groups that are called troops.
The troops exist from one to three adult men who are family and also have thirty women and kids.

The tiger belongs to the same group (Gennus Panthera) as lesions, leopards and jaguars. These four disasters are the only ones that can burn.
A tiger burns not from full power like a lion, and it's more like he's a whole sense.
The favorite piece of ocelots are small animals. They sweet bones, skins, kids and birds like that. The ocelot sweet almost only on animals that are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists suggest that the ocelots use their ability to spend on small animals (they prooi) by cutting on the ground where they were.
They can look well in the darkness and move very unexpectedly by night. Ocelotes swim on prooi by making themselves one with the environment and then spring on their prooi.
When a small group organism (small population) goes from the large population of which they are coming (e.g. by moveing on a mountain chain or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they are not easy to return), they are often in a different environment than previous.
In this new environment, other basic materials and other enemy are proposed, so the new population must be differently established or adjusted to provide competition.
Because they still have the same adjustments as previously, the original population has not completely changed.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to seem less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from appearance, that you can't call them the same kind.
This process is called a kind of form and simply provides for the form of new species, and the type is not to prevent and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce acids that inhibit people and take carbon dioxide on those people.
By photosynthesis, plants take their nutrients from the sun. They also care for shadow.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants, we eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosault was on the top of the food chains of that time, and he had no fear, except other Mosaws.
His long boxes had more than 70 flegscherpe dentists, more an extra set in the hill, which means that nothing or no one could miss him.

Although the mere part of their food would be trusted for us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or inhabited skins, including eternal wines, slaughter, and a kind of boyfriend that was called a sleep museum.
Furthermore, there was another difference; poor people and women already stolen during the eating, but rich men would like to take together a banket where they were swearing at their feet.
Later, Roman ancient times did not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in the past centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomates, ground snakes, cacao. Furthermore, no old Roman has ever eating a caloon.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the house of that god.

Sometimes, as a part of the temples towers were built in the form of piramides, called ziggoterates.
The top of the Tower was a special sanctuary for the god.

He did this discovery, but there lived there at that time for Eskimos.
Although it was all 'Scandinavian countries', the people, the king's family, habitats and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norwegian were very different.
You may think after the film National Treasure there is a card behind the Independence Statement.
However, it's a misconduct, but there's something written on the back, but it's not a shadow card.
On the back of the American Independence Statement, the words 'Original American Independence Declaration, or 'Original American Independence', on 4 July 1776. The text is subscribed under the document.
Although no one knows who it has written, it is certain that the big perkament (from 29 inch at 241ä2 inch) has been previously discovered for store.
So it seems that the indication is just added as a type of label.
Thanks to the D-Day countries and the fights that were followed, the northern of France was released, but the south remained employed.
It was registered by Vichy-France, and these were French people who, in 1940, settled on the side of the Germans and so cryed with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, many allied with Operation Dragoon South France.
The Americans and the Free Frenchs had freed Southern France only two weeks later, and then they went to Germany.
A structure is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a community.
From the Latin civilism, which means citizenship, the term of the terms of the Latin citizens, which is then the state of citizens, and citizens, which contain the city or state of the city, and that also defines the form of society in a certain manner.
Capital states are the preachers of nations, and a culture suggests that knowledge is transmitted on several generations, a continuous cultureal footprint and a balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often do not allow the relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognised as an alarm.
During the revolution, ten States were a weak central government in the Confederation articles, only a congress existing.
There was no national executive or legal power and trusted in the implementation of all decisions on State authorities that often did not want to cooperate.
It also did not have the power to reject tax laws and tariffs between States.
First, all States had to agree unilaterally with the articles before they were adjusted, but the states named the national government not so seriously affecting their representatives.

Japan consists of nearly 7000 islands (with the largest Honshu island), and thus Japan is the seventh largest island in the world.
In view of the cluster/grupe islands in which Japan is available, Japan is often known as a 'iceland'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when marine members from Europe run through the island and gave the name Ilha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC founded themselves in the south-west of Taiwan as an exile basis, where the VOC packed the domestic grain production processes and the work of Chinese employees on rican and sugar plants.
In 1683, the western and northern coast areas of Taiwan were transferred by manoeuvres of the Qing dinastics (1644-1912), where Taiwan was as a province of the Qing Keizer Republic in 1885.
After the latter in the First Sino-Japan War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed in 1895 the Shimonoseki Treaty, where the Sovereignty on Taiwan is transferred to Japan that the island goes up to 1945.
The Machu Picchu, built in three large buildings, consists of Intihutana, the temple of the Son and the Kamer with three Ramen.
The largest part of the buildings at the edge of the complex is rebuilding so that tourists have a better image of how they are exhibiting it before.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was rebuilt. The renewing is still on the gang.
For example, the worldwide is the most possible photo format for staring images 35 mm, which was the normal film format at the end of the similar film time.
These are produced up to the day of today, although it is especially the relationship of the image that transfers the image sensor of the digital camera.
Funny enough 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The image relationship of this size (of 12 to obtain the simplest relationship of all numbers) would be in that case 3:2.
Many gangable degrees (e.g. APS) are equal to or a deep approach of this image relationship.
The rules of third parties, where many misuses are made and found by many, are a simple directive which makes the image dynamic and even overview.
The most effective place for the main underwerp is on the swimming point of the lines. This way is the vertical and horizontal image in three (see example).
In this period, in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For over a thousand years, the Christianity of European States agrees, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizens, his whole mortal power had influenced everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that the welfare must be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has this reason for money.
The church was over a thousand years the central authority in Rome, and this relationship of power and money led to the fact that many people began to doubt whether this principle was fulfilled.
The Great Britain set a block box on sea towards Germany, just after the extinction of enemy.
The strategy was effective, since it was not possible to provide vital provisions to military and citizens, but this block box was the general international law adopted in the past two centuries in various international agreements.
The Great Britain has placed mines in international waters so that it could no longer vary ships in all the parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
As a result of the limitated response to this tactic, Germany expected that there would be a similar response to the unmarried under-sea war guidement of the country.
During the 20s, most citizens and nations had a attitude of pacificism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent that there would have ever been such fears.
Tesla migrated in 1884 to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 hundred, a close bond and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (her former father) for Thomas Edison.
The old Chinese had a unique way to reflect different periods; each stage of China or any dominant family had a distinct dynamic.
There was also an instable period in which the provinces were distributed. The most known time was the three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin dinastics.
In that time there were huge wars between different elements that fight for the troon.
In the history of the old Chinese, the time of the three Kingdoms is booking as one of the most bloody horns. Twelve people die in the struggle for the highest place in the great palace in Xian.
The Revolution has had major social and political impacts, such as the use of the metropolitical system, a movement of the absolute monarchie to republicism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants instead of a certain leader.
For all human demandants, after the revolution, the functions were obtained, so that the most ambitious and appropriate candidates could store.
The same is for the army, and the army are no longer based on someone's class, but on the pocket of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired in other countries the impressed working class to a revolution.
Mohammed was intensely engaged in above-term issues. He often went to a green that was later known as the Grote of Hira in the mountain of Noah.
The green itself, who has passed the tooth of the time, gives a very vital image of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The green is on one of the mountains on the northern side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even as it was known that the green had, it was not very easy to find. Once in the largest dominant total isolation.
The only thing to see is the light, beautiful air and the many rounding mountains.
The Great Piramide of Gizeh remains one of the seven world winners.
The Great Piramide is built by the Egyptians in the third century before Christ and belongs to the numerous large piramide structures to honor a dead pharao.
The Plateau of Gizeh or 'piramides of Gizeh' in the Egyptian Valley of the dead contains different piramides (which is the greatest Piramide), several smaller tombs, temples and great sfinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Farao Khufu. Many of the smaller piramides, tombs and temples were built as honor to the women and family members of Khufu.

Top means that you must start at the point and take the strike away. It means that you must start with the boot kitchen (the place where your hand holds the strike) and accumulate the strike.
A remarkable movement generally produces a severe sound, while a swimming movement produces a sound more stronger and more attractive.
Take the freedom to draw your personal characters, but don't forget that the printed strike signs there are a musical reason, so they must usually be respected.
A group of market women was held on October 6th 1789 after the departure of Louis XVI, Mary Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They are reasoning for returning to the French capital in a train, rounded by sweet and thirty-third monkeys that threatened the King's couple.
Through the actions of the multitude people, the king and the king were forced to open the windows of their cups completely.
At a given time, someone held the head of a king's waiting that was killed in Versailles up to the eyes of a terrorized Queen.
The war costs of the imperialism of the United States regarding the transfer of the Philippines are paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were assigned to pay the American colonial regime tax to finance a large part of the costs and the interests on obligations were issued through the Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippines government.
The American imperialism was a large part of the huge profit of the long-term exploding of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templates, we must know what the context was that the task was given to the end of the order.
The time when this happened is generally indicated as the High Mediterranean, the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th century (1000-1300 n.Chr.).
After the early Mediterraneans, the high medium juveniles came, and they were again followed by the late Jews, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a major association ideas in practice: of technology offer or technological obligation to a strict feeling that human throat is struck by a subjective logic connected to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
The majority of the interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of the technologie follows a track that is mostly more than cultural or political influence, and that technology has the "efficacy" on joints inherited instead of socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the coming of the car automatically leads to the explanation of roads.
However, a agricultural road network is not economically admissible for a few cars, and therefore new production methods are developed so that autonomy costs can be reduced.
The massive automobile also provides a larger number of accidents on the road, which leads to the development of new health care techniques in order to rebuild human body.
The Romantics included a large part of cultural determinism, which was resulting from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romania, the geographic formed the individual and after the past of time, there were habits and cultures towards this geography, which were a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws.
Constantinopel was seen as the capital of the feodle Europe, as Paris is the current Modeof City.
It was known from about 400 after Christ to about 1100 after Christ as a epicentrum of luxury.
In the 12th century, the status of the rich was decreased, mainly through the return of the crossing farmers with sediments and specifications that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Round this time, Paris also took the title of modeofstad over Constantinopel.
The quarter of the beach is high-time in the 10th, 11th and 14th century.
Kleding was at the beginning strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the eastern.
However, because of the long communication channels, the styles in the west were 25 to 30 years later.
At the end of the Mediterraneans, it began to swallow a own style in Western Europe. One of the major developments was the result of the crusts: people began to use buttons to confirm their clothes.
The self-visual agricultural is a land where food is produced enough to meet the needs of the farmer and its family.
Agriculture with a purpose of lifekeeping is a simple system that is generally biological, which is used by the seed which comes from the ecoregio and is combined with changing plants or other relatively simple techniques to make the fabric the most optimal.
In many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures ensure that equivalent persons who feel unreasonable are composed of social standards, and that they can develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may distinguish themselves through age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of quality: language, ethical, religious, political, sexual, geographical or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture are often shown to which group they belong through a certain symbolic style in what they carry, in how they act and the jargon they speak.
One of the most useful methods to illustrate the importance of society was the number of regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults during the growth.
They are called "wolf children" or "wolf children". Some wolf children have been covered by people (or mostly their own parents); sometimes this child was left in the stake, because parents did not want to accept the serious intelligent or physical limitation of the child.
Untreatable children may have brought serious child malnutrition or a serious trauma before they were abandoned or before they were disfellowshipped.
Others are confirmed that they have been brought by animals, and some are said they have used only in the wilderness.
A disfellowshipped child who has not grown by humans can show that the behaviour of the animal (in the physical limits), such as fear of human direction or invariability.
Teaching on project bases must simplify and make education more interesting, but smoking will continue to be a step further.
Scopolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who have a new learning experience, for example, a new computer program or which begins to a new project.
Support can be virtual and real. For example, a docent is a form of support, but the Microsoft Office's clipman network is also that.
There are some virtual scaffle that is built in the software that asks, offers memory supports and declares procedures that may be difficult to understand without help for students.
There are several reasons for children to justify the care, such as smoothing, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow in an environment where they are not careful, where they are not given to them and where they are not able to develop themselves, but this happens.
We are considered a safe area for these children.
It is intended to ensure a safe home, lovely suppliers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care must be satisfied with all the needs that were reserved in the previous home.
The inter-personal and mass communications are accompanied on the Internet.
The various characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, "Learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important reasons for use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivations as 'personal participation' and 'conserving relationships' when they investigated the reactions of the public on websites.
To use video records, it leaded to an outstanding findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are face movements that long a few milliseconds.
In particular, no one can recognise a lie by leading only on microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks describes in his test The President's speech how it can be possible that people who cannot understand the conversation because of the brain damage, the honestity of them can clearly invade.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as home dogs, also about the ability to interpret the behavior of people.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variants: hiding and visible.
With change, new genetic variation is added; by selecting this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation there is a variety of divorce and recombination between the two groups.
A primate with a swimming system that seems to be the man in the savanne but difficult to get the necessary amino acids from the plantable sources that there are.
Moreover, it may not have serious consequences: growth rate, subnutrition, and even death.
The most easy to find plantable sources are the skins in sheets and fruits, but unless they are cooked, they are for primates as we are difficult to reverse.
Not only animal food (man, termetics, eggs) is bleedable, but contains also very many proteins containing all essential amino acids.
While we do not have to be disfellowshipped if our grandfathers solve their 'protein problem' in the same way as Chimpanzee on the savanneous problem today.
A sleeping interruption means that you will wake up with a reason during your normal sleep period and that you go back to sleep within a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This is easy by using a relatively sweet sweet wheel that brings you back to your consciousness without that you will immediately wake up.
If you're in your sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get your bed out to get him off.
Other options on the basis of the biorhythm, for example, drink a lot of liquid substances before you sleep (and especially water or thee, a known diureticum).
The quantity of internal calm in which a person has a person is against the amount of stress that brings someone in his or her body and spirit.
To be less stressed, even more the present life force. Each person is able to reach satisfaction and total peace.
Everyone can be able to light her mind. Only your own stress and negativeness are in the way.
The Tibetan budhism has its basis on the learning of Boudha. However, this form of budhism is expanded with the path of love and with a large number of technologies from the Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple kern of chain-yoga, meditating, and a follow-up of universal love.

Domesticed gears were generally held in skins on a heavy or other grain area. They are then monitored by snakes, as well as the more known sheeper often a child of youth. Today, they are still healed in the same way.
Almost in the 16th century, it was built in an Anglican horseway.
Although the horseway was only a rail of plants, the horses had to walk faster and continue larger numbers than the difficult ways of that time.
The dwarsbars were already rationally used to keep the rails on their place. However, rail was more effective if there was an iron point on the top.
This was already the gangable practice, but the iron resulted in more swimming day to the wooden cooks.
The woods ended with wood variants. In 1767, the first total ice rails was put into place.
The first form of transport that we know is walking. People began to walk up two million years ago when the Homo Erectus was taken up (which means a right man).
Their past, the Australopithecus, went less often on right.
The Sahelanthropus has been marrying seven million years ago, and it was possible to have two pieces.
We can make a more environmental life, connecting us to a environmental movement or even acts to relieve future sufferings.
It is, in many cases, like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a timely solution, we need to determine the cause of the problems and slow them out of the way.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have significantly changed the earth, and also have increased overpopulation and the extravagant human life style.
After the Declaration of Independence adopted on 4 July, a manual draft was sent to the press chair of John Dunlap, which was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
It is made during the night between 150 and 200 exemplaries. These are now better known than 'Dunlap distributions'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document first on 8 July in the garden of Independence Hall.
One example was sent to George Washington on 6 July and was predicted to their troops in New York on 9 July. Another example arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flights are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many Paleonologists believe that there is still a dinosaur type today, and we call them birds.

The manipulation of data encoded in binary digits is the base for almost all computers that are used today.
A binary number may have only two values, 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal income is not clearly clear. Symptoms like brakes are so common that cannot be placed directly.
The presence of open doses medicines or giftal domestic chemicals is the best indication of internal compulsory.
Check the label for specific EHBO instructions for that specific gif.

Find out how the world works on the basis of the scientific method is the main objective of science, and this method is the directive for most scientific research.
However, it is to be more than only testing companies; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential appendix, to place questions and to observe, as a guide for scientific research.
Natural knowers and philosophs focused on classical texts, especially on the Bible in Latin.

In physiological and behavioral observances of ritmes, there is often a strong dependence of endogen processes and the production through the biological clock.
Most bodies, including bacteria, mixtures, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not so much reactions on external periodic signals.
Biological horses are self-predicting oscillators that pass a cycle for a certain period, even if there are no external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experience was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to inject their own DNA in a bacteria.
Two experiments were performed. In one experiment, the DNA was marked in the faggle with a radioactive fosfor and, in the other experiment, the ice of the faag was marked with radioactive swivel.
Mutations may have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned, and whether the cells affected are kimbing cells.
Only changes in kimbanians are patrimonial. Other mutations can lose cells or cause cancer.
Natural tourism is pleased to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.

Everyone in this dynamic transport chat is on one way in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Scientificness shows that this huge carbon economy does not have the biosphere in the stability that human evolution could occur in the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and makes use of transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developing countries, problems with water quality or instant burden are rarly compared.
How does there be so many complaints in transport systems, why is it going to be wrong daily? his transport techniques are just unreasonable? or is it something fundamental?
The movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between individuals shall be regarded.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow because the conduct of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% of security.
Happily, the conductors are reasonably prognosed, and this means that traffic flows have some level of coherence and that there is something to say in a wise area.
There have been relationships between the three colour properties to improve the development of the traffic: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
The planning, design and exploiting of road-based equipment is facilitated by such relationships.
Insects began to fly as the first animals. Thanks to their air power, they could escape more easily to enemy and more efficient food and parking partners.
The benefit of most insects is that they can raise their legs through the body.
This is why they can hide in a larger number of smaller places for rabbits.
Currently, there are only libles and switching their legs.

People know the most basic chemical elements such as gold, zilver and copper from oldness, because all of these are in nature and it is quite simple to deal with these with primitive tools.
The philosoph Aristoteles showed that everything consists of a distribution of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This looked more like what we know of the four situations of material (in the same order): fixe, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theoreticalized that they go into new substances to form themselves to what we see.
Legerations are simple said a combination of at least metals. As you surely know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and kalium fall under the metals. Of course, there are also metals as zilver and gold.
Legerations may also contain little amount of non-metal elements, for example carbon.
All in the universe is built from materials. All materials consist of small parts that are called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there is a trillion atom at the end of this sense.
That is why the pool for many people was a faithful friend when it was started.

Currently, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a point driver.
You can ask what happens to the keyboard when something comes on the market.
The atom tree works according to the principle that energy costs to combine a nuclear with many protons and neutrons.
It's like you're cutting a heavy car. If the nuclear is redistributed again, a part of the energy will be free.

The corst is dark under the maria and swimming under the height of the surface.
There may be more seas on the side because the short is dark. Lava could be easier to reach the surface.
Content theories are aimed to figure out what people move and what they talk.
This theory makes people feel like certain needs and/or desires that are innovated to be adults.

This is often leading to a crowd between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards as the normal teams, although small differences are different.
In most cases, virtual team members have the first point of discussion for their direct physical group.
They are often more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams can gather according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.

It has been known for a long time that different types of brain cell, traumas, wounds and tumor behavior can affect and can lead to changes in the spiritual capacity.
Since there are still more technologies, we are increasingly learning about the structures and processes in the brain.
This offers us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models in which we get more inspection in the processes of our mind.
IA does soon think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research on machinery behavior, learning and intelligent approach.
Developing machines to automatize tasks for which intelligent behavior is required, AIDS is under investigation.
A few examples are management, planning, the possibility of responding to diagnoses and questions of customers and recognition of manuscript, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.

Virtually part of an excursion is also a fantastic way to share back on a trip and experience with future classs.
For example, students of Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website on their travel to the headquarters of the State, which is re-formed every year and which previous online versions are saved to serve as a platbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Many are their grammatics and games at the beginning still bad, but it changes quickly by having a public.
Since students are often the most critical public, the blogger aims to improve the writing work and to avoid such critical.
By blogs 'Twitter students were also intended to learn more about the world to go to them'. The need to keep the public interested is inspiring students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires cooperation and students to expand the learning from the traditional school day.
In good use, the blogs "Learnings can help to develop and think analytically; by active discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other materials and simultaneously determine their own position in certain matters" (Oravec, 2002).
