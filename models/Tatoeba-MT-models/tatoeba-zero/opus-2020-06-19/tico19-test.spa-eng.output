How much more or less do you have these symptoms?
and always the pain of skin must be treated in this way, especially his age
and also fibres
and should also be controlled by your colesterol and arterial pressure
And now it's fiber?
And do you feel this pain of skin now?
and has also difficult to breathe
And can you tell me what other symptoms have more than this?
and how much he had fever
and I also have tos
And I have a little relaxed and tos.
And today I really have a very strong pain of skin
And this is the time given for its allergie to the pool.
and the pain of skin appears
And I think I've got a little fever.
And I want to describe where I feel the pain of skin
And they're having something of fever too
and with its previous diabetes
And you know, I feel like the skin is struck me
And you know, people touch me over all the time
and feels pain of skin
and said it's a pressure on the skin
Someone of the family has a heart problem, cardiac disease, heart attack, collesterol high, high arterial pressure
Is there any other symptom or problem that notes beyond muscle pain?
Is there any other sick people like you with the same symptoms in your home?
Do you have any other symptom?
Do you have something out of air?
I still feel pain in the skin
Because this is the grip time
But they should also not ignore us through the pain of the pain of the heart of origin.
But now a more important problem is this pain of skin.
But I have difficult to breathe
But I know that many people touch me above.
But always we should treat skin pain with the maximum seriousness
But now you're breathing well, right?
for this pain of skin I forgot completely
it feels like if someone destroys you
It's still feeling as a lack of air
Do you want to be sick with similar symptoms?
Do you have another chronic disease, such as high blood pressure or something like that?
Do you have another disease, chronic medical problem, such as diabetes?
Do you have something lacking of air in addition to skin pain?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have some episodes of lack of air with that?
Do you know what symptoms?
See the picture?
drink very liquid today
but I do tests for diabetes
However, it has very similar symptoms to mys
How much fever has?
How is your arterial pressure?
if continues to have high fever
if there is a hundred fever of the levels or higher
if you believe that your symptoms or problems justify a better review
I gave me fever last night
I also had a little fever
I've got fever last night
I've got a soft pain here, in the skin
I also have some difficult to breathe
I'll send you a image
I have a bit of skin pain today
Today I've just got a little head pain and something of fever.
in my opinion, it's a grip
in my opinion, it's a little grip
Is it like someone very, very weak sit on his skin?
all started with head pain and fever more or less at the same time
I swear the center of the skin
is a pressure like skin pain
It's in my skin
It's in the center of my skin
is in the center of the skin
I feel pain in the skin
I'm so worried about this pain of skin
I want to tell me how this pain of skin describes
as high blood pressure or diabetes
as just in the center of the skin
Now you can take a Tachipirin tablet for fever
Now, Mary, how many days ago has the symptoms
Now he said he had a pain of skin.
On the other hand, I have a little pain of skin
Well, you have some other symptom beyond this, which is not only the pain
Or someone sit on his skin?
Basically similar, with fever and tos, head pain and muscle pain
just in the center of the skin
Show me in this image where the pain feels
since it has fever
So you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
Asking me about his skin pain
the fever is higher for the night
the fever that had the last two days
the fever began to be higher tonight
this is the doctor Porter in the triage center of the emergency room
Well, can you tell me a little more about your skin pain?
Well, I'm feeling a pain in the next part of the body, here on the skin.
Well, I'm feeling a strong pain in the skin.
Well, when I have that pain in my skin
What kind of pain do you have in your skin?
When did this pain begin in the skin?
Where does he feel pain in the skin?
{NS}
feeling as a pressure in the skin
You know, I have diabetes and others.
He said he feels this pain of skin.
Accumulated rapidly increased incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulated incidence of cases of illness by coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although in different phases according to the country, COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerated cases of unknown ethiology neumony was reported in Whan, Province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Control and Prevention of Nurses reported that the caused agent was a new coronavirus that now is known as a severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80% of the people with COVID-19 have a weak disease, i.e. a infection of respiratory treatment with or without neumony, and that most of them are recovery.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of the cases develop a critical disease that require intensive care.
The mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the trends in the accumulated COVID-19 incidence in each countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEE) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the RU of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the RU
After China, COVID-19 continued to promoting geographically and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently continued.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiter et al. was informed about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the definition of WHO case.
In the EU/EEE, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in people returned from Whan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date, were registered 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, with 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths in Italy only.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and accumulated incidence of cases of COVID-19
In the European Headquarters Control and Diseases Prevention Center (ECDC), case accounts of COVID-19 reported in each world, only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, National and Regional Health and WHO are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the RU and to compare it with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the accumulated incident of cases of COVID-19 to 14 days; so we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEE country and RU, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the quantity of cases reported in each country to 15 March 2020, at 8:00 p.m., compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 tendencies in the EU/EEA countries and the RU
In the EU/EEA countries and the RU, in general, followed the province of Hubei (China) to 14 days.
In the EU/EEA and the RU in general, the accumulated COVID-19 incident began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly the rapid increase in Italy's reported cases, but all other countries of the EU/EEA and the RU showed tendencies from the accumulated COVID-19 incident (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and RU countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, at March 15 to 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEC countries and the RU had already registered a total number of cases comparable to Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 informed is rapidly increased in the EU/EEA and RU.
The trends observed in the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemia is progressing in a similar ritme in all countries.
This is therefore despite the different stages in which countries are found, the variations in national health responses and, perhaps, the different definitions of case in countries and protocols to select patients that should be tested to confirm COVID-19, including the late tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of the regions affected in Italy described a situation where 10 per cent of the patients with COVID-19 requested intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and the intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (not data shown).
However, systemically should be collected to complement current monitoring data focused on the quantity of informed cases and the amount of death.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, which was 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100.000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and intermediate care in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEE country and the RU of the prevalence of COVID--19 hospitalization cases associated with risk >90% supervision of intensive care capacities, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the ECDC risk on COVID-19.
Since cases have been consolidated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally attend to a defined regional capture population, the information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be available at the level of the designation of statistical territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the RU.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 that require medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the regions affected by Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and integral approach to delay the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in a mixation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time to the decisions and hospitals responsible for understanding, accepting and adapting their response in order to agree if it is not implemented with anticipation.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of pandemia.
There is a short period of opportunities during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to strike the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, it is likely that health systems from other EU/EEA countries are affected by patients who need intensive care in the next days and weeks.
The illness brothing by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), until the time caused death of 3000 people and infected more than 800,000 in China and other parts of the world, which generated a disaster for humans.
Similar to his homogeneous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the murcillago and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and more affected by older people than youths and more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emergency disease, the purpose of this article is to provide an appropriate and complete analysis of the research theme, which is quickly developed.
We will treat the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognostics and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis helps to understand and eliminate this threatening disease.
The spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an inaugurable and unbelievable memories for all Chineses, who were urged them to stay home during the whole festival and for a number of weeks more because of the breast of a new viral disease.
The virus is almost the same name as the Coronavirus (COV) caused a severe respiratory syndrome blote in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called SARS-CoV-2, and associated disease was named by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Epidemia started in Whan, China, and rapidly proclaimed throughout the country and almost 50 countries more than all over the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80 000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3000 failed patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including their virus, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnostic and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the follow-up of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to resume progress in research on this new matter which is quickly developed.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a brote in 2012).
We will also consider what is known until the time on the prevention and prognosis of disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Traditionally coronavirus has been considered non-legal pathogens for humans, which are mainly caused by 15 per cent of common refrigerators 4.
However, in this centuries we found two times with high-pathogen coronavirus in humans, i.e. the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused a brote in China, 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon distributed to many other countries with a spontaneous mortality and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID 19 brote is the third by coronavirus from which it is registered in the history of humanity.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, the first time of the Unknown neumony was informed to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, he was known the sequence of the coronavirus.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case was registered in Whan.
During the period, epidemics were rapidly promoted to the cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was informed, as suggested that human transmission could be possible.
On January 23, the city of Whan was placed in quarentery and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had been directly contacted with the Whan's marine market that was considered the origin site of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the brochure a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, disease has already been propagated throughout China and almost 50 countries more than all over the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation evolves rapidly, the dimension and the final severity of the breast cannot still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more updated illustration of epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1QA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected to people of all ages, but mainly to people from 30 to 65 years of age.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons had more than 50 years, very few had less than 20 and only 14 infections were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more than men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was expanded mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
In the meantime, 5 days (of 2 to 9) were between the appearance and the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (inter3.0 to 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (inter 4,8 to 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95%: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the time of massive mobilization before the Primary Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1,44% (95% IC: 1,10-1,86%) and the adjusted mortality of patients was 3,06% (95% IC: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender, age (≥60) and serious neumony.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large and involuntary virus containing a single sense ARN.
They can divide in four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gama and delta, of which the alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those who infect humans.
Spiga glucoprotein (S) of the involvement is one of its cell-receptors, angiotensin enzymes 2 (ACE2) and peptidel dipeptidel 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the fusion of membranes is produced.
The viral ARN genome is released to plasma cyclopedia; after the replication of the viral genome, the genome ARN, together with the glucoproteins of the envolture and the proteins of the nucleocapside, a vescules containing viruses, which then fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 secundary samples taken from the original broth site: the Huanan marine market of Whan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particules were found in human respiratory epitelium ultradelived sections.
Human ACE2 has been determined to be a SARS-CoV-2 receptive and SARS-CoV.
However, protein S from SARS-CoV-2 is one of the more weakest human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN’s expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., it revealed the structure of electronic chromoscopic of the ACE2 human length in resolution 2.9, in complex with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was accompanied as a digme, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can join two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic dialysis for the medicine study to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Heritage and intermediate guest
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were originated in snakes and were transmitted to humans through skins and cattles, respectively.
In a philosogenetic comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was considered that the murcielago is the native host of the SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96 % to two similar coronavirus to the SARS of murcilelages called ba-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate hosped helped the virus to crush the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains dissolved the path of transmission.
Ji, and al., I proposed the serpients as the portators of the virus of murcilelates to humans, which implies the homologue recombination within the Protein S.
According to a study, Guangzhou (China) researchers suggested that pangolines (length hocicles that are food of hormones and which are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate SARS-CoV-2 host based on a genetic homology of 99% in a discovered coronavirus in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% distributed by the totality of two genomes is still a great difference; however, it is expected to be concluded that they provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive in vitro 48 hours in a severe environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolete and warmth and 56 °C for 30 minutes; Eter, Etanol to 75%, a desinfectant with clore, prochloric acid, cloroform and other grass solvents, but not clorhexidine, are effective to disable virus.
All human populations in general have no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, however, are likely to be the new coronavirus.
Until the time, no detailed study on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
As a result, we can only recurr to previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognised by the host’s immune immune system through the pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including the C-type-receptors, the Toll type (TLR), the NOD-recepters type (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR).
Through different ways, the virus introduces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maduration of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferencies that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate macrophazic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus to save immune responses.
All right, the adjusting immune response is summarised to the fight against virus.
T Linfocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, meet a significant role in defence.
The CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells to produce specific antibodies for virus, and CD8+ cells directly kill the virus infected cells.
Co-operator T cells produce proinflamatory cytocins to help defence cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the T functions by inducing the pharmaceuticals of T cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies from a recovery patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exagerate reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free roots that can cause serious damage to pulmones and other bodies, and in the worst of cases, multi-organic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, has more likely to affect older people with competitiveness and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large amount of virus or whose immune functions are compromised have more likely to be infected than others.
The average estimated period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Whan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days in average and was 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as previously described, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (inter 3,0 to 7,2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the time of quarter effectively based on the most accurate incubation period; this will prevent asthmatical persons to transmit the virus to others.
As a habitual practice, people exposed to virus or infected should remain in quarentery for 14 days.
The quarter should be extended at 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as sweet, disnera, muscle pain, marble, head pain, sweet pain, skin pain, skin pain, diarree, nausea, and sweet.
Some patients had disnea or hypoxima a week after the appearance of the disease.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly until developing acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested for an early diagnostic.
A demographic study of the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentage of the symptoms was 98 per cent for fever, 76 per cent for seal tube, 55 per cent for diarrhoea and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients request breathing assistance.
Similar places were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of a asthmatical person.
A 2012 demographic study demonstrated that the patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry tons (47 per cent) and disnee (55 per cent) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory assistance, much more than the patients with COVID-19 and in line with the most letality of MERS in relation to COVID-19.
Diarrey (26%) and gargant pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99-100%) was demonstrated by severe tube (29-75%), disorder (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and gargant pain (13-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance required by approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent when confirmed cases reached 66.576 throughout the world.
Similarly, SARS’s mortality for November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, according to a democratic study of June 2012, mortality was 37 % in 2494 cases confirmed.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and was up to 6.47 with a trust (IC) range of 95% from 5,71 to 7,23, while the R0 of the SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparation of the SARS-CoV-2 with the MERS-CoV and the SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater dissemination capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its letality is less than that of these two lasts.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerated conglomers usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruise.
Patients often have travel or residence previouss in Whan and other areas affected or contacted with infected persons or patients in the two weeks before appearance.
However, people have been informed that the virus can be brought without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital high data can return to the virus, alarm signal that the time of the quarentee should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white white bleeding in peripheral blood (especially linfocitos) in early stage.
For example, linfopenia was observed with a white bleeding container of <4x109/l, including a linfocytes container of <1x109/l, and high levels of aminotransferated asset in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The hepatic and muscular enzymes and myglobine levels were high in the blood of some patients, and protein C reactived and erytrocytic sedimentation were higher in the blood of most patients.
In patients with serious cases, the level of dimere-D, a product of the degradation of fibrine present in blood, was high, and linfocytes account was progressively reduced.
Annomalisms are detected in the toracic radiographies of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or options in bilateral smeriled vehicles in pulmones.
Patients are often developing atypical neumony, a sweet pulmonary leakage and a cold respiratory syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously affected by gas exchange.
The disfunction of type I and type II reduces the level of surfacting and increases the superficial pressure, which reduces the ability of pulmonary neumocs to increase and increase the risk of pulmonary failure.
Consequently, the worst findings in the toracic radiographs are often in parallel with the maximum gravity of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the disappearance of neumocits, the training of a hialin membrane and the infiltration of linfocides in the interstition, and multi-nucleated synthical cells in the pulmones of a patient who died because of the disease, which corresponds to the pathology of a viral and SDRA infection, and similar to patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ARN was used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high rate of negative false rates that could accelerate epidemie, clinical manifestations were started to be used for diagnosis (which was not yet based only on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the SARS diagnostic.
Consequently, a combination of preceding of diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radioological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SERLOCK technique application protocol based on CRISPR to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 to 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitro) using a graduated switch in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Successfully, the new technique can drasticly increase sensitivity and conviction if in clinical samples is checked.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may mostly provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed before the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapy includes currently or potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosupresor, steroids, plasma of recovery patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is proposed to use the plasma of recovery patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are working to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the pulmones to the principle and probably also, at a lower level, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive device and the rings.
However, disfunction and respiratory insufficient are the largest threat for patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to eliminate symptoms and save life, including oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in accordance with the gravity of disease.
Patients with serious respiratory symptoms need extracorporate membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonal bypass technique that is used for the treatment of cardiac or potentially mortal respiratory insufficients.
In addition, the maintenance of electronic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary and septic shock infections, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytocin torment is the result of a excessive reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytocin torment is a form of systematic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytocins, including TNFα, IL-1ś, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNś, IFN _BAR_ and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead to immune cells to release a huge number of free roots that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-organic failure.
Immunouspression is essential for the treatment of cytokine torture, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-receptor IL6 antibodies, were used to treat cyclonic torment.
Other immune treatments for cytokine torment are the modulation of immune response by T cells; IFN- Gamma block, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; an overview of 4 cytokin signalization, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosupresors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce inflammatory damage gravity.
However, steroids in high doses did not benefit from serious pulmonary leakings in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious secondary effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects prognosis notably.
However, the careful use of corticosteroids was recommended in low-modered doses during a short period for patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the time of this analysis, no antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotic analysis, has been tested in intravenous way in an American patient with COVID-19.
remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Afterwards, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with monocatenary ARN, such as MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead provided the composition to China to make a couple of tests in infected people with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarea, nausea, vomites, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may be produced after the combinated treatment with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Recovered patients plasma and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients that have been recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy persons so that they do not interfere with disease is not something new.
In fact, recovery patients are usually relatively higher antibodies against  pathogen in blood.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B linfocytes to fight pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and direct neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from a group of patients recovery of COVID-19 and was injected to 10 serious sick patients.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, along with inflamation reduction and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to check and clarify this to propose the method for its use at a large scale until specific therapists are developed.
In addition, data of therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be considered detentively.
For example, antibodies may stimulate in excess of immune response and cause the syndrome of release of cytocins, which may cause mortal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is normally low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to fight global pandemia.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of patients recovered and to identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or search for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, their effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a form that would be diagnosed in accordance with MCT theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or implicit, since it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
At present, because of the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with leak to moderate symptoms or for those who have been recovery of serious stages.
For example, the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hungary (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT at only 30% of their patients with COVID-19, had the lower recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a quite approached comparison, since many other effect factors, such as the quantity and gravity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study compared to Western medicine treatment (MO) only with combinated MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the necessary time for the recovery of the body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group only in the MO group.
What is more surprising, the deterioration rate of symptoms (the weight to serious) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4 per cent against 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8 per cent against 39 per cent).
However, the efficiency and security of the CTM continue to wait for more well-controlled tests at larger levels and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to determine the effective components of MCT treatment or their combinations as possible.
Patients with suspicious or confirmion of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of highly contagious and even mortal disease, and people in quarentene also experience abuse, solitude and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and tos, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early stage of the SARS breast, a series of psychiatric moratives, among them, persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotropical excitation, psychotic symptoms, delicate and even suicide trends were reported.
The trail of contacts and the quarter binding, as part of the public health responses to the COVID brochure, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of the county, the quarter and the estigm in their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health should be given attention to patients with COVID-19, people with suspect and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public you need.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health equipment, clear communications with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 brochure and treatment plans and use of professional devices and applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupte the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to potential guests and often supplement the antiviral treatment in the control of emergency viruses.
Develop vaccines based on S protein to generate powerful neutralizing antibodies and long-term or immunity protected against SARS-CoV.
Vacuns have been evaluated with live virus actenated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivon effectiveness of these potential vaccines in older people and the letal stimulation models and their protection against the infection of zoonotic origin virus should still be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the expansion of SARS 17 years ago, and no new case has been registered since then.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomers of MERS in the Middle East that are distributed to other regions because of the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
MERS vaccination strategies have been developed using disabled virus, DNA plasmed, virus vectors, nanopartical vectors, similar viruses and recombinating protein subunities, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunities is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemia.
However, it is difficult to overcome difficulties because of the long period (18 months in average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently started to demonstrate its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may be gradually recovered without secules.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with serious cases.
The establishment of a prognostic model for disease is therefore essential to enable health agencies to priorize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies until now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
age: age was the most important factor for the SARS prognostic, which also results accurate for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was increased in people from 30 to 65 years and 47.7 per cent of those patients had more than 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requesting intensive care more likely had substantive competitiveness and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not (a mean 66 to 51), which suggested that age is a prognostic factor for the development of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 before 0.27/100 000), as previously described.
Compatibility and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care with more likelihood are suffering from augmented and arrythmic infection.
The cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause hepatic disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is noted that age and substantive diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere between themselves.
Anormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (PCR) in blood reflects the gravity of inflamation or the leakage of the tissues and has been proposed as a possible factor of prognosis for disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery.
Moreover, the correlation between the PCR level and the seriousness and the prognosis of COVID-19 was proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransfera (AST), aminotransferous alanin (ALT) and Chinese creatine (CK) may also help predetermining the patients’ evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and the heat, and are released when the tissues are damaged.
Indeed, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic disfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: torax radiography and temporary progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for preventing clinical disorders and COVID-19 complications.
The use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immune who are commonly used as adjuvante treatment for infected diseases in order to reduce inflammatory damage gravity.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with serious SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent and bad life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stresses: as previously described, during the COVID breast of 19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, since generally long periods suffered in quarennium and extreme incertitude, and attended the death of neighbors and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies until now, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than the SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the higher respiratory ways and causes light symptoms or not symptoms in the early infection, as happens with other coronavirus that cause common refrigeration.
Therefore, patients infected in premature or incubation periods may produce a large number of virus during their daily activities, which is very difficult to control epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV would occur when patients were seriously ill, while mostly transmission would not occur in the early phase.
Indeed, the current COVID 19 brown is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS breast.
Great efforts are made at the time in China, including Whan's closer and surrounding cities and nearly all the population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating a significant damage in the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is reduced, which indicates the deterioration of epidemic.
According to the most optimistic prediction, the bret will be concluded for March and the descendant phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, and al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly infected than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., created a model for predicting epidemic evolution and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could be infected to two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected as native and pharmaciens in patients who had been recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, which indicates that recently identified virus could become a similar cyclic episode to the influenza.
However, promising signs have been observed in China, given the reduction in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategies could operate.
It was originally predicted that ebola would cause up to a million cases with a mid-million of deaths.
However, through a quarter and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
It is possible that, as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weak as infectious terms and finally is extensive or become a less pathogen virus that is associated with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is following (f. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible via the tube or the extracts, and may also be through direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the fats, which provides a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 per cent of the cases may have been caused by nosocomus infections, which includes 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
It should therefore be careful to protect humans, particularly medical care providers, social workers, family workers, colleagues and, in particular, trans-related patients or infections.
The first defence line that could be used to reduce the infection risk is the use of maskers; the use of chirurgic and maskers with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps to control virus propagation.
Surgical maskers impede that liquid bottles of a potentially infected person are transmitted by the air or adhere to the surfaces, from which they may be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 maskers (serial number 1860) can be protected against the inhalation of virus such as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can cut them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both half of 85 nm.
Since particules can penetrate up to five appleted surgical maskers, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 maskers (serial number 1860) and not chirurgic maskers.
In addition to the mass, medical care providers should use isolation limits in order to reduce the contact with virus.
Virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, despite using a N95 masker; it is possible that the virus has entered his body through inflated eyes.
Consequently, medical care providers should also use protective or transparent cards while working with patients.
For the public generally affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that the population is laid down the hands with the most defects of the habit, trying to stay home in voluntary quarter and limit the contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered a suitable distance to keep people away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and to avoid dissemination of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great warning in China for his experience with SARS breast in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the Director of the Whan's Headquarters' Control Center was quiet to citizens saying that the new virus had a low contagious and limited reproduction capacity, and that there would be no problem to prevent and contain disease.
This message noted significantly the warning of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was disappointed to contain the disease at the minimum level in Whan.
The Chinese Diseases Agencys should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public advertisements, since every word is important for citizens and can make a change of their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to clinical information, instead of waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their early stage, instead of trying to tranquilize the public; and (4) more regularly in implementing adapted and effective simulations to increase the consciousness of the public about epidemic diseases and to test and to improve the system of reaction of society regularly.
The COVID brote (19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has been distributed throughout China and some 50 countries more than all over the world at the time of this analysis.
Since virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between COVID-19 and SARS symptoms, COVID-19 bread has generated the feeling of reapparition of SARS.
However, there are some notory differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain epidemia and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects young people more than young and more than women, and seriousness and mortality are also more than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 are transmitted to the virus even though they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do it when seriously sick, which generates a higher difficulty to contain the propagation of COVID-19 in comparison with SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 was promoted in a very faster and generalized manner than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, treatment can be positive in the virus again.
These results are dramatically increased the risk of propaging virus.
In view of the so fast progress in the research of COVID-19, there are remains a number of important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 go?
Although a 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-moleaker coronavirus, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates.
What animal was the medium species that transmitted the virus of the original guest, say, the murderers, to the humans?
Without the answers to number 1 and 2, the transmission is not effectively possible, and the brown can be resurrected at any time.
While molecular modelled and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the ACE2, how is the virus exactly entering the breathing cells and causes post-patoological changes?
Is the virus also one of the cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a fast and necessary diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will epidemie be?
How does the virus genetically evolve while transmission between humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, will it be extended as SARS or will it periodically resurrected as the grip?
Although you can take some time, it is essential to search for answers to these questions and to many others.
However, you take care of what you want, we have no more option than stopping epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Sonotic origins of human coronavirus
Change and adjustment have stimulated the coevolution of the coronavirus and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronavirus caused mild diseases, such as common refrigerators.
The severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have inverted the currency when revealing how devastating and mortal can be a human coronavirus infection.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 in Central China to the end of 2019 put the coronavirus again in the centre of care and surprised us with a high transmissibility and a reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, the SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have their origin in the musulmans, in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate hosts of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests have direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of interactions between coronavirus and hosts in animals could also provide important information on the pathogeny of the coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronavirus, with emphasis in the history of their discovery, as well as in its zoonotic origins and in the transmission between species.
Of course, we compare and contrast human different coronavirus from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is analyzed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the virus development in the seriousness of disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a positive monocatenary ARN virus group with envolving.
These viruses, which have the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kg, among the ARN viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, in the form of coron that have under an electronic microscope.
With regard to its structure, the coronavirus has non-selected genomes that share similar organization.
Nearly two thirds of the genome include two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyproteins.
Poliproteines are further processed to generate 16 proteins in structures, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including, of spy (S), of the membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessiry proteins of each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in the sequences of protein, the coronavirus is classified in four kinds (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), including the gender of the betacoronavirus contained the majority of human coronavirus and is subdivided in four languages (A, B, C and D).
The philosogenic evidence has demonstrated that the murcilels and routors are the source of genes of most of the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while the birds are the main reserve of the gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
Thousands of years, the coronavirus have constantly crossed the species' barriers and some have occurred as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a coronavirus of the Middle East (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 normally cause weak symptoms, such as a common or diarrhoe.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious infections of the lower respiratory ways in a relatively higher quantity of patients, with a higher probability to develop the acute respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and extrapolar manifestations.
The first chep of HCoV-229E, B814, was excluded from the birth secretation of patients with common refrigerators in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause auto-limited symptoms.
In fact, even with SARS breast, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection generally is inoffensive.
The SARS brote that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastators of the current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude latality of around 10 percent.
10 years later, the breathing respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) placed a persistent epidemie in the Arab Peninsula with spatical propagation to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV), who later was appointed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the current epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been covered more than 3120 lives and infected by more than 910,000 people to 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronavirus have a zoonotic origin in mucilelages, ratons or domestic animals.
Several evidence lines support the evolutional origin of all human colonies in murcileals, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but represent great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Strengthing the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework to understand the natural history, the impulsor force and the factors of salt restriction between species.
This could also lead or facilitate the search of the reserve and intermediate animals and amplificators of the SARS-CoV-2, which would have significant implications in the prevention of propagation in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origin, the transmission between species and the pathogeny of human coronavirus.
In particular, we emphasize and analyze the common topic that parental viruses of human coronavirus are normally not pathogens in their natural reserve hosts, but are returned to pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also review the trend of development of human coronavirus, in which the increased transmissibility is generally facilitating the reduction of pathogenicity.
The development of the current SARS-CoV-2 brothing is also analyzed in this context.
There is a knowledge of animal coronavirus since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first time the B814 skin of HCOV-229E of the birth secretation of patients who had affected a common refrigeration, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals such as shoe, mushroom, skin, skin, and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronavirus were identified.
A short summary of the history of human coronavirus discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructional.
The first skin of HCOV-229E was excluded from the respiratory ways of patients with higher respiratory ways in 1966 and then was adjusted to grow in the WI-38 cellular lines of the pulmone.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E presented symptoms of common refrigerator, such as head pain, shocked, general pain and sweet pain, with fever and tumor in 10~20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organ and the after-serialized passing in the brain of milk ratons.
The clinical features of HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to the caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus A and rinovirus.
The HCOV-229E and the HCOV-OC43 are distributed by the world and aims to be forwarded predominantly during the winter station, in template climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruss is less than one week, followed by a disease period of approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed a weak common refrigerator.
Only some immuno-committed patients presented a serious infection of the lower respiratory ways.
SARS, also known as "atypical neumony", occurred the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the ethnic agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS is retired to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
SARS's epidemic resulted in 8096 cases informed with 774 deaths and was promulgated by many countries and continents.
In addition to superproviders, each case could occur for about two secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral charge on the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present mialgia, head pain, fever, general and scalofish, followed by disnea, tones and difficulty breathing as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, modified hepatic function and high level of chinasa creatine are common anormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Disfunctional damage, proliferation of epitelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory ways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, hepatic and renal, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytocin Torment, which could be mortal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was isolated for the first time of the pulmonary biopsy in heaven by a family of the initial patient that traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been dedicated to the investigation of human coronavirus.
HCOV-NL63 was excluded from a 7-month child of the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevailing in smaller children, adults and immuno-committed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corea, conjungitis, fever and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a natal sample taken from a 8-month child suffering of neumony in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
HCOV-NL63 has been estimated that nearly 4,7 per cent of common respiratory diseases were caused, and its maximum accident was at the beginning of the summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringite, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with neumony and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to neumony and bronquiolitis acquired in the community, HCOV-HKU1 was associated with acute asylum exacerbations.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused light respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviers in the community have been adapted well to humans and, in general, are less propens to change to high pathogenic diseases, although there were accidents because of unknown causes, such as in the shortest case of a more viral subtype of HCoV-NL63, which recently reported that serious infection of the lower respiratory ways in China has been infected.
In general, when these human coronaviers purchase the ability to be effectively transmitted and maintained in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was isolated for the first time in 2012 from a patient’s 60-year-old pulm that had developed acute neumony and renal insufficient in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases have been recorded with time contact to close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary brown occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the SARS, characterized by augmentable neumony.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal insufficiency, which is only given with MERS among human coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrey and vomite.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed in the laboratory, with high letality of 34.4 per cent, which became MERS-CoV as one of the most devastators of humans.
From average to the end of December 2019, conglomerated patients with neumony in Whan, Province of Hubei, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 were detected.
The World Health Organization declared the current breast infection of lower respiratory ways caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also named COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases were confirmed throughout the world, with a crude latality of 3,4 per cent.
Obviously, the letality in Hubei (Chine) is 4,2%, while out of it is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, tones and disnee.
Therapy has also been observed in some patients.
Neumony is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly evolve the acute respiratory syndrome.
While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nucleoid sequence of 82%, they are classified in different branches of the philgenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less pathogen, but more transmissible in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asthmatical people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been informed, which could contribute to their rapid propagation throughout the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, similar and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 remains the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the gravity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community (i.e., HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or leakness symptoms or, in particular, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as SARS-CoV infection is, although the relationship is a little lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristic patterns both of the human coronavirus acquired in the community and of the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least equal to the human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains aware of whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after human passes, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with the other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 meets a significant role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, should still be dissolved in future studies.
You also reviewed special interest in finding whether SARS-CoV-2 could show statisticality, such as the case of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable dissemination after human passes, will affect the final development of the COVID broth.
The four human coronavirus obtained in the community that causes light symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four human coronaviers.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient pandemics of human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus has been eliminated by human coronavirus that cause serious diseases in humans and humans who have developed severe diseases by human coronavirus.
To this happen, human coronavirus should be replicated in humans in a sufficient manner to allow the accumulation of adaptive changes that contrary to the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, while more time continues the SARS-CoV-2 brown and more infected persons, it will be more likely to be completely adapted to humans.
If appropriate, your transmission to humans would be difficult to stop through the quaren or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronavirus acquired in the community have moved into human populations and have caused common refrigerators in immuno-competentious people.
These viruses don't need a animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV high-pathogens have not been adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is insufficient.
They need to keep and distribute themselves in their zoonotic reservations and seek the opportunity to spread to human objectives that might be possible through one or more intermediate and simplified guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features both with SARS-CoV and MERS-COV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the human coronavirus acquired in the community at least at the time.
However, it is more pathogens than human coronavirus acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains seeing whether it will be completely adapted to humans and circle among humans without a heavy animal of reserve or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, we will be useful to examine the definitions and features of the evolutionary, natural guests, reserve, intermediates and human coronavirus simplifications.
A animal acts as an evolutionary hospital of a human coronavirus if he has a closely related older who shares high homology at the level of the nucleotic sequence.
The ancestral virus is normally well adjusted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve host has a continuous and long-term human coronavirus.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parent virus.
Instead, if the human coronavirus is introduced in the just intermediate guest before or almost the same time of its introduction in humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and usually to be patogen.
The intermediate guest can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and comply with the function of a simplified guest by allowing the virus to be transitoryly replicated and then to be transmitted to humans to the expansion of human infection.
A human coronavirus can cause a infection in the terminal guest if it cannot support its transmission in the intermediate guest.
Instead, human coronavirus can also be adapted to the intermediate host and even to generate long-term endemics.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve host.
Epideological data have discovered retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been contacted with caza animals.
The following investigations on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had an increased prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Massed palms (Larvate Paguma) and a map dog on live animal markets were the first identification of similar virus portators to SARS-CoV, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were registered after killing all market targets.
However, it was noted that the skys of sacred or grain massed palms without exposure to the markets of lived animals were negative in SARS-CoV, which suggested that the massed palms would only act as a simplified intermediate host, but not as natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Of course, since 80% of the different animals of the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, they cannot be discarded of the possibilities that several small mammal species also act as a medium guest of SARS-CoV.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
A closely related coronavirus of mosquilages, called CoV HKU3 murcilelago Rhinolophus related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is in mosquitoes of Chinese.
These murcilelags are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other muscle coronavirus are shared with the SARS-CoV homology of nuclear sequence of 88-92%.
These studies have seen the bases of the new concept that murderers have seen emergential pathogens in humans.
A number of similar SARS (SL-COV) coronavirus have also been identified in muciles, but no one, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the transforming enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) human is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of mucilelages uses the ACE2 of mosquilages, citrus and humans as receptive for ingressing cells.
Surely, patients smiling with convinced SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of the SARS-CoV in mucilelages, which shares a type of nucleotic sequence of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruss, generally, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that murcilelages are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
According to the philosogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 mucilelago and the CV-HKU5 mucilelago.
The CV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host, the dipeptidil peptidasa 4 (DPP4) for the income of the virus.
The polymerarate ARN sequences depending on the MERS-CoV philosogeneticly closer to its betacoronavirus antiparties identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't find a MERS-CoV live in wild snakes.
MERS-CoV and its nearest relatives, the CoV-HKU25 mosquilage, share a 87 per cent of the nucleoted nucleoted sequence.
Indeed, the murderal could not be the immediate reserve host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have demonstrated that the drugs are seroporative in MERS-CoV- neutralized antibodies specifically, as well as the chambers originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the narrow narrow of drugs, which supports more than the chambers act as a good reserve host of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be emphasized that, in general, weak symptoms were observed, but a massive propagation of virus in infected chambers for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Of course, infected chambers propagate the virus not only by breathing, but also by fecal-oral way, which is also the main way of dissemination of the virus of murcilelages.
However, there are still questions, since many cases confirmed by MERS have no front of contact with chambers before the appearance of the symptoms, which is reasonably attached to the transmission between humans or to unknown transmissions involving unrecognised animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleote monology with a rhetorial coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated by Rhinolophus afnis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to allocate a parental relationship.
This means, the murcileans could not be the immediate reserve hosts of the SARS-CoV-2, unless they are found in the future of almost identical muscles.
Probably, intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and are killed in the huanan's largest market market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, which indicates a likely event of transmission of animals to humans.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggested that a group of small mammals in danger known as pangolines (Javanica Mans), could also be a betacoronavirus ancestral related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new pangoline coronavirus shares a number of nucleotic sequences of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90 % at the level of the nucleotic sequence.
They are grouped in two similar virus sublines with SARS-CoV-2 in the philosogenic tree, one of which shares a domain of receptor association (RBD) most similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a identity of amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are more different, despite a higher sequence homology in the whole genome.
A previous study in pangolines was also informed the detection of viral counts in pulmonary samples, which also resulted in being related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various manual assembly and curation methods to generate a partial genome sequence that included around 86.3% of the viral genome of full length.
We cannot disappear the possibility that the pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangoline because of the diversity of sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutional way of the SARS-CoV-2 in mosquitoes, pangolines and other mammals should still be set.
While higher sequence homology is found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the higher genome sequence homology.
It is extremely speculative that the high level of simultaneity between the RBDs of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the median convergent development of selectivity.
A counterproposal defences recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As impulsive force in evolution, recombination is extended between betacoronavirus.
There has yet been no conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the high-pathogen human coronavirus, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 was also studied.
The philosogenic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have been originated from the muscle coronavirus, while the parent virus of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in roots.
A coronavirus of mosquilages called ARCOV.2 (Coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) identified in a three-color mosquilage of North America presented close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another mosquilage coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although the cameras were also suspected as intermediate hosts.
For more clarity, the knowledge of the animal origins of the known human coronavirus is resumed in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The philosogenetic analysis has proved that human coronavirus transmission events were carried out between species in the history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species until infecting humans from grain animals in 1890, a breathing pandemia was registered.
Previous transmissions between species of HCOV-229E are not known so precisely.
Alphacoronavirus of murciélages has been closely associated with HCOV-229E.
Among them is a alphacoronavirus.
Several evidence lines support the transmission of the virus of murderers to humans directly.
First, in contrast with the alphabes, humans could have contact with murcilelets in a shared ecological nice.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alphabes.
Secondly, the alphacoronavirus of mosquilages related to HCOV-229E are different and not pathogens in the muciles, while alphacoronavirus of alpaca caused a breast of respiratory disease in the infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of the alphacoronavirus related to human HCOV-229E cannot be discarded.
In fact, murderers are the direct source of pathogenic virus in humans, such as rabbi virus, Ebola's virus, Nipa and Hendra virus.
Indeed, it would not be too surprising that the murcileans would send HCOV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while the alphacoronavirs act as a genetic acquire of HCOV-229E, alphacorns and drugs could act as intermediate hospitals transmitting virus to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of transmission between species, murcileals to drugs, and drugs to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in the murcileals is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by post-scanners.
It is obviously clear that the murcileans contribute, with a provision of virus species, to exchange genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
The long-term, densely pooled colonies, the close social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favorable conditions that make murderers to the ideal "virus prosecutor".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in the drugs for decades.
It is well adapted to these chambers, which have been an intermediate host, to be a stable and natural reserve host.
MERS-CoV causes very low disease and maintains relatively low variation rates in these animals.
Their spatial transmission to humans is an accident and humans are still a terminal host of MERS-CoV, since transmission is insufficient.
In comparison with the role of chambers in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolines, if there was, is different in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, betacoronavirus of pangolines are highly pathogens in pangolines.
It may be a terminal host of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as civests in the case of SARS-CoV.
several transmission opportunities between species of SARS-CoV-2 of human animals, should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, murderers could be the reserve host of a SARS-CoV-2 virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological kid with the musulmans, through the killing or the mining of carbon.
Secondly, pangolines might be one of the intermediate simply guests where a SARS-CoV-2 virus had been introduced recently.
Humans oppose the virus through the killing and the consumption of cazameat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be likely to be SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies study is needed in home animals and wild animals.
Thirdly, as previously mentioned, the recombination and adjustment of the SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contacted both with muscles and pangolines.
The search for animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the various types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play a significant role in facilitating the crop of the species' barriers.
First, its relatively high variation rates in the replication of the ARN.
In comparison with other monocatenary ARN viruss, the estimated change rates of the coronavirus could be considered as "modered" to "altitudes", with a mean substitution rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, by site 2, according to the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new guests.
The coronavirus has an exorribonuclea of read-test, whose removal from place to extremely high variability and the attenuation or, even, the inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotic analogy remdesivir eliminates the replication of the coronavirus through the inhibition of this exorribonuclease and the ARN polymerasis dependent on ARN.
remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the change rates of the coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
Furthermore, the change rate usually is high when the coronavirus is not well adapted to the guest.
In comparison with SARS-CoV, which has a high variation rate, the changing rate of SARS-CoV-2 apparently is lower, which suggests a higher level of adjustment to humans.
It is expected to have already been adapted to another guest near the humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the drugs.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic derivative makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 lose their efficiency rapidly.
Secondly, the long ARN genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination, and thus increases the probability of coevolution between species, which provides the appearance of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique copyright open read frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded to direction 3' of the genome.
Thirdly, the coronavirus changes randomly and frequently patterns during the replication of the ARN through a single "copy-choice mechanism".
In a guest acting as a mixer vehicle, the chain change is often produced during the ARN transcription of the coronavirus.
ARN of full and subgenomical length could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
The philosogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as the SL-CoV of mucilelago and the CV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three of the previously mentioned viral factors, the viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that affects the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in events of transmission between species.
Based on the comparison analysis between human-coV-isolated SARS-coV-ceases, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences a rapid adjustment in different guests, in particular with mutations in the S-protein RBD.
Generally, the RBD of the protein S of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the response of the guest antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in 318-510 amino acids in S1 fragment, which is one of the human ACE2 and its corrections for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognise the ACE2 receipters of several animals, including skin, skin, mouse and map dogs, which allows the transmission of virus species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated cypaes of human virus and cives in RBD and 4 of them were found in the reason of association to the receptive for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the majority of the spaga protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be essential for adapting the virus to humans.
It is emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with the SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 unit S implies that the majority of protein S association with human ACE2 could have been changed.
Indeed, an electronic chromicscopical study indicates the majority of 10 to 20 times greater than this unit in comparison with human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be interested to determine whether any other corrector could be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surely, HCOV-NL63 is also one of the ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptide N in HCOV-229E and sealic acid 9-O-accepted in HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after transmission of species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell-receptors, the result of the transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the guest.
The divergence of these guest proteins between humans and natural reserve hosts of human coronavirus, such as murciles, drugs and roueers, could be an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus should use hosts' dependence factors and substantiate hosted restrictions factors so that the transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction with virus-hoested should still be identified and characterized.
A Objective Research of Full Genome could result in use of SARS-CoV-2 through advanced CRISPR technologie.
The appearance of new human coronavirus: we leave from zero
The diversity of the mushrooms coronavirus gives many opportunities for the appearance of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, the coronavirus of murcileals act as the genetic acerve of human coronavirus.
Furthermore, the rapid change and genetic recombination, also stimulate the evolution of human coronavirus and represent two important steps in this process.
For example, the purchase or loss of new protein-coder genes have the potential to drastically change viral phenotypes.
Among the accessibility proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in adapting humans, since the SARS-CoV-related murcile virus was isolated, but it was determined that ORF8 different proteins were encoded.
A elimination of 29 SARS-CoV nucleotic characteristics was found in isolated cepas at the beginning of human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed that it is a adaptive change that promotes the change of guests.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has potential recombination preceding with alpha and gammacoronavirus rings, where a larger number of rebuilding regions were identified in polymeraric ARN dependent on ARN.
Recommendations were also identified in NSP9, most of NSP10 and parts of NSP14.
Similarly, MERS-CoV epidemics suffered recombination events between different languages, which occurred in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reconstruction events have also been observed in other human coronavirus, in which human coronavirus are reassembled with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that the artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genome, which is most likely to release viruses from the earliest selection pressures, for example by the guest immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of an ORF4 full length in the HCoV-229E prototype cap, due to the elimination of two nuclears.
While a ORF4 intact intaked in the HCOV-229E virus, Alfacoronavirus alpaca presents an insertion of a single nucleote, which would result in a framework change.
Lastly, although not less important, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also encouraged by the selection pressure in their guests.
No symptoms were detected or only leak symptoms were detected when muscles were infected with coronavirus, which indicates the mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the murcilelages.
It seems that muscles are well adapted to the anatomic and physiological coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in muscles reduce effectively the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in muscles is eliminated due to the positive regulation of the inhibition receptor of natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I of the higher compatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of muscles could eliminate the replication of the coronavirus and affect the testing of exorribonucleasa, which provides the selection pressure for generating high-pathy virus cepas when they are introduced into a new host.
The more pathogenic coronavirus cepas could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adjustment to the guest.
Therefore, it is not possible that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the past two decades.
The coronavirus is not pathogens or causes weak symptoms in their guests of reserve, such as murcilels and cattles.
Strengthly replications are not caused by a strong immune response to the guest.
The secrets raised why there are asthmatical portators and what causes serious human infection cases.
Severe symptoms should mainly be the hyperactivation of immune response and the torment of cytocins, where while stronger is immune response, more seriously is pulmonary damage.
Instead, in the asthmatical portators, immune response has not been associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy to devine immune response could have benefits in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the murders.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should therefore be benefitous at at least in the early phase of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
Furthermore, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in mosquitoes is defectuous.
According to this reasoning, NLRP3 inflamation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 remains the general line leading to the appearance of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus of murcilelaes has been found that shares a 95% nucleote monology with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of murcilelagas that shares a 96% nucleote monology with SARS-CoV-2.
While the civests and other animals of the market have been determined to have an identical virus to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hire of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronavirus of pangolines has been significantly homologed to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests, or that betacoronavirus of pangolines could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questionnaire remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by the man, being deliberately or by accident.
The coronavirus have recovered protagonism because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 breast.
The study of the coronavirus in murcileals and other animals has deeply changed our understanding of the importance of zoonotic origins and the animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
Another evidence has demonstrated that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were originated in the murciles and transmitted to humans through intermediate hospitals.
Since infection by SARS-CoV originates in the contact between human and market civics, closure the hume markets and killing the cybers that had been effective in them to trail the epidemic of SARS.
Following this same reason, pangolines should be removed from the hume markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several betacoronavirus sightly associated with SARS-CoV-2 bands.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in the droids for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, cute and lana for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all chambers to control MERS, as did in China with the salvage animal markets to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent MERS breasts, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for cakes, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to remove these viruses, they could appear new genotypes that cause brotes.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus are circulated in salvage state.
In particular, the museum coronavirus with potential zoonotics are very different.
There are major possibilities that these zoonotic coronavirus evolution and recovery, which would lead to the appearance of new coronavirus, more transmissible or more mortal in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between human and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be taken.
In fact, many virus have existed in the planet for a long time.
Keep in their own natural reservations until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although murderers have many features that promote the dissemination of virus, human contact opportunities with murderers and other wild species can be minimised if they are educated to the population to rejoice them.
The continuing monitoring of mothers is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and breasts.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans are left from the environmental nichos of the natural reserves of zoonotic virus.
There are still a number of pieces in the rupture of the SARS-CoV-2 синothic origin.
First of all, if the murcileans transmit a ancestral virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze what circumstances the murcilels and pangolines could share the same environmental nick.
Secondly, if murderers have a more direct role in human transmission, they should be determined how humans are in contact with the murderers.
Thirdly, if a third mother acts like the true intermediate, it must be diluted how it interacts with the different species, including humans, murcilels and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be likely to be SARS-CoV-2, the supervision and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is already a murcilelago, a pangolin or another mammal, is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their parents who are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research on this area will dilute the evolutional way of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications in prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The criteria for diagnosis of "speaked cases" and "confirmated cases" of COVID-19 should be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and is a good reference to fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guide and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of "speaked case" and "as confirmed" in accordance with the last guidelines for COVID diagnostic and treatment (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a breast, which is now officially known as the illness of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO was qualified to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a rapid advisory guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
He took a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Training of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts significantly changed.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., submitted a simple classification proposal based on its clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence for our guide and also represents a valuable reference to this pandemic throughout the world.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, its work also needs to update according to the last COVID diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020) to confirm a suspicious case, any point of the epidemiological antecedent features must be combined with two points of the clinical manifestations to complete analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological precedences:
Epideological advances: (1) travel or residence in the city of Whan and the German areas, or other communities in which the cases of COVID-19 were informed in the past 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (2) the presence of contact with infected cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a test of a positive nuclear acid); (3) beforewards of contact with patients with fever or symptoms of the city of Whan and the garden areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases have been informed in the last 14 days before symptoms appearance; (4) previous contacts with groups confirmed (≥ 2 cases of sympathy or sympathy).
Clinical manipulations: (1) fibre or respiratory symptoms; (2) features of COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white gluble containers showing a container of normal, decreased or reduced linfocytes in the early start phase.
The diagnostic of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some character of pathogenic or serological tests in the following way: (1) the test of the polymerara string in a real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the complete viral genome that shows high homogeneity to new coronavirus recognised; (3) positive results for the specific IgM antibodies and the specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a sugar test; or a change of the IG antibodies specificly against the negative SARS-CoV-2, or increased title of the title of the ≥4 times in the rescue phase.
We can see that the reaction test in the real time of polymerase to detect nuclear acid in samples of blood or respiratory ways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
Furthermore, there are more evidence that they remember that we should be careful with the asthmatical and symptoms of atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou and al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The pointing system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct tests and ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnostic of "speaked case" and "confirmated case", we recommend searching and implementing the most new guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely way to provide help.
Bangladesh informs five new deaths because of COVID-19, the largest amount in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths last night because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day because of the virus.
By the evening, the Bangladesh Epidemiology Institute, Hepatic Control and Investigation (IEDCR) reported that the amount of registered cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovery cases were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
At a online informal meeting, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said that the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases had more than 60 years, two between 51 and 60 years and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic COVID-19.
A hospital official told him to Anadolu Agency, a local media of news, that one of the defeats was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission, who were attending in Kuwait Maytree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video advertisement, the Minister for Transport for Carretera and Bangladesh Punts, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for more time from initially expected, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport was initially started on 26 March and was expected to end Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products was still allowed, such as medical, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection occurred in Bangladesh on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and the woman of one of them.
On March 19, these three were already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections throughout the world
Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections over a million over the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University's data.
At least 52.000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The shooting took place the same day that Malaui confirmed his first colonavirus infections and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without infection by coronavirus.
On the eve day, the World Health Organization informed 1 051 635 cases confirmed, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Hour (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were registered, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting the data from University Johns Hopkins, that Wednesday was more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
In the whole world, countries announced more strict measures to prevent disease propagation.
The juvenile Sergei Sobyanin, the camp of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia would continue to understand their wages without going to work until 30 April.
Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national emergency status 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes for, ten abstentions and a vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the rest to the sanctuary citys La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the remaining touch was held between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thai planned to implement a retreat touch between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia decreased the hygienic paper limits by transaction
Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles decreased their hygienic paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all the supermarkets of the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These restrictions were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chain.
It was reported that consumers were disappointed by fear of COVID-19 if people had to be self-related.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of hygienic papers to deliver home to a request package.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four transaction packages applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press communication on 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "Those supermarkets even ended the product within a time of delivery", and said that the request "no previous," while ALDI, on March Facebook, said that it was "unexpected".
The sales went up with a "furt increase" last week, according to a Woolworths voter.
Costco Costco was also limited the amount of two packages last week.
To enhance the deficiency, Coles requested more packages to providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional existence, while ALDI had existences available for a special offer of Monday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of Australian Retailers Association, said that minorists are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions of local rents on vehicle delivery time are difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, in accordance with suppliers, to satisfy the request, and less offers.
On Monday, ALDI announced that, after previously released existences, some supermarkets could not make the special offer of Mondays.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a minorist expert at the University of Queensland Technology, said that supermarkets provide the existences every night.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a volunteer article, which causes a low amount of existances in numbers, and, when explode, leave a wide empty space in the stars, which intensifys the sense of slowness.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [que] if there was a abundant amount of article in the stairs, if products like hygienic and desinfecting paper rolls could [be purchased] and have large amounts, probably would be minimised by the panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The reciclated hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said the past Wednesday that the existances were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who produced the Kleenex hygienic role, and Solaris paper, which produced Sorbent, indicated that they were working 24 hours the week's 7 days to maintain the supply, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some owners of property offered free hygienic role to the first income in Melbourne, when they were performed less substances because the buyers had free time on the long weekend of the Worker Day.
The edition of NT News's Thursday, a newspaper in Darwin, included a eight-page card designed to be cut and used as a hygienic paper.
The supermarkets at the principle were reacted to imposing restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report of 3 March, in which they said that there were no plans to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including mass, desinfecting, severe products, liquid jabine and skin.
Similarly, out of Australia, Sunday afternoon was observed that the British Online Supermarket Oka limited the purchase of the Hygienic Paper Andres to two packs of 12 rubbers.
The World Health Organization declares pandemic COVID-19
On Monday, the World Health Organization (OMS) declared pandemia the current brote of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the magnitude of propagation of a disease, not how dangerous are specific cases, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take measures:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, do tests, treat, isslan, identify and mobilize their people in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
We are very concerned, both of the alarming levels of propagation and seriousness, as well as of the alarming inaction levels.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, director of the Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses of the United States, pandemia "no preceding".
In the statements published by CNN in February, "After the influence, no other respiratory virus has been raised from the appearance to the continued world propagation."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, and said, "We have never seen a pandemia caused by a coronavirus."
"And we never had seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," acknowledged.
The new condition of pandemic emerges after WHO's decision in January to declare the brood an emergency of international public health.
The director of the National Institute of Alergy and Infectional Diseases from the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the brochure, "in conclusion, it's going to be worse."
By Thursday, Associated Press reported that at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 were worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The pandemic of the coronavirus 2019–20 is a cured pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The brochure was identified in Whan, China, in December 2019, as a international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as pandemia on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million COVI-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths were resulted.
Some 364.000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the letality rate per case was 4 per cent in China, while at the global level is 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, tos and lack of air.
The complications may include neumony and syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty.
The time from exposure to the appearance of the symptoms, generally, is from some five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supporting therapy. Recommendated preventive measures include lavaging hands, covering the mouth in the tuberculosis, maintaining distance from others and controlling and self-extradition of people suspected to be infected.
The authorities of the whole world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarters, retreat touches, danger controls at workplace and installation locks.
Pandemia has caused a serious socioeconomic global change, post-up or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized lowness of provisions raised by the purchases motivated by the panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local levels in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Error information on the Internet virus was distributed, and there were incidents of xenofobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of academic and East Asian appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Because of the reduction of travels and the closures of the weighted industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Whan, China, (the capital of the province of Hubei) informed a group of unknowledged neumony cases, and at the beginning of January 2020 began an investigation.
The cases, mostly, were related to Huanan's largest market market, therefore it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the brochure is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus closely discovered with the muscles coronavirus, the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Afterward, it was found that the first person who knew that symptoms were ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the modelled market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, a non-controlled South China Morning Post report suggested that, a case resigned on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases according to the reports were decreased in China but gradually increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the amount of new cases outside China had first exceededed the number of new cases within China.
There may be a significant amount of uninformed cases, especially among those with lower symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been informed in young people, and those of 19 and less people represented 2.4 per cent of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the main UK Scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people subject to tests of COVID-19 and have received a positive result as confirmed according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries have had official policies to not perform evidence in persons who only had light symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, a estimated amount of 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these infections were the source of 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March stated that the amounts of infections in Italy were significantly higher than the cases reported.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the United States Control Centre and the Prevention of Diseases decided that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovery.
For those who do not, the time passed from the development of symptoms until death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequentest 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, about 97 000 deaths had been assigned to the COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to people older than 60 years, and 75 per cent had prerequisite diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official death records for COVID pandemia-19, generally refer to the defeated persons who have made positive COVID testing, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the amount of real deaths due to COVID-19 is much higher, as maybe it is not included in persons who have failed to do the test, for example, in their homes, in older homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the amount of additional deaths during pandemia exceeded the official COVID death record in a factor from 4 to 5 times.
A voter of the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Diseases (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the amount of decreased deaths] is a substimation", a statement corrupted by the anecdotic sub-containing reports in the United States. This substimation is frequent in pandemies, such as the porcine grip pandemia H1N1 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Whan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the continental China occurred on 1 February in Philippians, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On February 28, outside the continental China, more than twenty deaths were registered in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than fourty countries and territories had reported deaths in all continents except Antarctics, generally several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and with the time, and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial brochure and the quality of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the amount of deaths shared by the amount of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
According to University Johns Hopkins statistics, the global death rate of cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number would varie according to the region.
In China, the estimates of death rates on cases reduced from 17.3 per cent (in those with the appearance of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (in those with the appearance of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the letality rate by cases, reflecting the percentage of diagnosed persons suffering from disease, and the letality rate of infection, which reflects the percentage of infected infected (diagnostic and non-diagnostic) that caused disease.
These statistics do not have a specific period and consider a particular population from infection until the case is resolved.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the letality rate for pandemic infections in its totality is 0.1% to 0.39%.
The higher estimation of this range is coherent with the results of the first allergic tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study which analyzed the impact of the tests on the letality rate estimates per case.
WHO states that pandemia can be controlled.
The pico and final duration of the brown are incerted and can differ according to the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania stated: "Infectional brotes, if they are not controlled, generally stabilize and then start to reduce when disease remains without available hospitals.
But, at this time, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction when it will happen."
The main medical advisory of the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, suggested that it would be able to end in June if it could be moved to all countries to follow the recommendations of the WHO on measures to stop the dissemination of virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 "this will be circulated, likely for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College directed by Neil Ferguson, the physical distance and other measures will be needed "too there is a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted with such easyness, disappears completely" and "It could become a state disease that repairs all the years."
The virulence of the recovery would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively not specific and infected persons may be asintomatic.
The two most frequent symptoms are fever (88 %) and seed tone (68 %).
The less frequent symptoms include fatigue, smuggling production in respiratory ways (phrame), loss of oilfate, lack of air, muscular and articular pain, guard pain, head pain, slowness, hepatitis, diarree or cyanosis. WHO states that some of the six people are seriously sick and have difficulties to breathe.
According to the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty to breathe, pressure or pain persistent in the skin, repentin confusion, difficulty to disperse and blue color in the face or laugh; before the manifestation of these symptoms, the immediate medical care is recommended.
Some of the infected persons may be asintomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm infection, researchers therefore suggested to control and carefully review those who have closely contact with infected persons to defeat the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the percentage of asthmatical persons occide from some to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and appearance of symptoms) covers from one to 14 days; more frequently is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of Olfate in the principle was 30% and then reduced to 15%.
There are still some details of how the disease is spread.
The disease is predominantly distributed during the close contact and through the small skins that produce in the tube, extraordinary or conversation; the close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, the skin can be moved from 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that virus can also be transmitted through small skins that remain in the air for more long periods, which can be generated to speak, and may also be produced breathing baths during the exhalation, even when speaking, however, generally, the virus is not transmitted by the air.
Boats can enter the mouth or narrow of the persons who are near or may have been inclined to pulmones.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonal reanimation (RCP), may cause respiratory secrets aerosolization and therefore air propagation.
You can also propagate when one touchs a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touchs the eyes, narrow or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the works, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China rejected the possibility of the Oral Fecal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious over the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although propagation may be possible before the symptoms and in advanced stages of disease.
People received positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the appearance of symptoms, which indicates that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asthmatical cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asthmatical transmission during contact trace investigations.
The European Heart Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) states that, although it is not absolutely clear the facility with which the disease is distributed, generally a person infected to other two or three, and the virus survives from hours to day on surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel 304, one day in cards and for four hours in cup.
However, this would take place according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 in mascotes and other animals.
There are no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend the hands after contacting animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected persons.
The coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was isolated for the first time from three people with neumony linked to the group of acute respiratory diseases in Whan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronavirus related to nature. Out of the human body, the virus dies when they are in contact with Jabon, which develops its protective envoure. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thinking you have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus groups genetically with betacoronavirus, its subgener sarbecovirus (linea B) with two cepas derivated to the mucilelago.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of muscle coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolines and human beings virus.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-CoV-2 shared as maximum 92 % of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediary host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, in the last moment, it is confirmed through the reaction in the polymerara string with inverse transscription (rRT-PCR) of infected secrets or by computer-tomography.
According to a study carried out in Whan, in which polymerara reaction was compared to the computer-tomography, the computer-tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerara chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not use the computerized tomography as a detection method or a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several NAR test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first published on 17 January.
The test uses the reaction in the polymerara string with reverse transscriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in samples of blood or respiratory.
The results are generally available within some hours or days.
In general, this test is performed with a nasopharinge hypocrita, although it can also be used for the gargant. Some laboratorys and companies are developing serological tests, which detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, no one of these demonstrated that it was sufficiently necessary to approve its general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certificates only.
The characteristic races in the images of computerized radiographs and tomographys (TC) of symptomatic persons include aximetric peripheral displaying opacity and outstanding laughing.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling a online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Because of supervision with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis by images without confirmation by polymerrase reaction is limited to COVID-19 identification.
A comprehensive study carried out in China compared to the results of computerized torax tomographys with polymerarase reaction and showed that, although the image diagnosis is less specific for infection, it is quick and sensible, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect the features of virus in images, both with radiographies and computer-tomography.
The strategies for preventing transmission of disease include maintaining a general personal hygiene, laying hands, avoid touching eyes, narrow or mouth with hands without having been laid before, and shocking or touching on a deceasable swimming puzzle and shooting the swimming pool directly into a deceastal container.
Those who may already be infected are recommended to use a surgical masker in the public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or disadvised all non-essential travels from and to countries and areas affected by the brood.
However, virus has reached the Community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that virus is spread within the communities, and some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that the medical care providers that may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use the eye protection. The track of contacts is an important method to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent more transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments to this end has generated concerns about privacy, and the International Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations made a statement to require limits on this type of monitoring.
A number of mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and at 7 April 2020 more than a twenty-five of experts groups were working in private solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to register the proximity of one user to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were closely contacted with someone who gave positive COVID-19 tests. They are surrounded wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, skin lavage and guards with bucal injury are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The lavage of hands is recommended to prevent disease propagation.
CDCs recommend that people lay their hands frequently with water and jabnon during at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visiblely sweet hands; before eating and sleeping the nest, tower or exhoruncing.
This should be that, outside the human body, the virus dies when he enters in contact with jabon, which disintegres his protective bottle.
CDC also recommended use of desinfecting for alcohol hands with at least 60 per cent of volume alcohol when water and jabin is not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch their eyes, necks or mouth with hands without having laid them before.
The surfaces can be discontaminated with several solutions (in one minute after exposure to desinfecting on an inoxidable steel surface), including ethanol to 62 to 71 %, isopropanol to 50 to 100 %, sodium hydrochlorid to 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 % and yodate pobine 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium gluconate and clorhexin glucoon, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a installation such as a office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactil screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cards that have been used by nursing people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover the mouth and nase with the flexioned cow or with a deceasable swimming pool to touch or exornate, and that they immediately desire the puzzle.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical maskers, since the use of a masker can limit the volume and distance of breathing smells that are dispersed when talking, exciting and toser.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mascarilla can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without a suitable hand hygiene."
WHO recommended the use of maskers by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although also recognised that maskers can help people to avoid touching the face.
A number of countries have started to promote the use of maskers by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommended using non-medical maskers which were produced with the screen. China specifically recommended the use of disabled medical maskers by healthy public members, especially when they are connected nearly (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take the public transport or to be in competitive places.
The health officers of Thailand recommend people to manufacture screen mask in their homes and lay them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited out of public spaces without using a mask or cooking nest and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when they are in public spaces to be able to protect and protect others.
The Austrian Government requested the use of maskers by all persons income to a supermarket.
Israel requested all residents to use maskers in public.
Taiwan, who has produced 10 million mask per day since mid- March, requested the use of mass by passengers in interurban trains and buses.
Panamá uses the binding use of masks to get out of air, while also recommends the manufacture of housemakers that can't buy them.
The maskers have also been used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (as well known as physical distance) includes measures to control infection designed to break the dissemination of disease by minimising close contact between people.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, jobs, stages, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods when they stay in their homes, limit travels, avoid competitive areas, use health forms that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now require or recommend social distance in regions affected by breast.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by the Governments and the United States Health Organizations had been reduced rapidly from 250 people (if it had not been known for COVID-19 in a region) to 50 persons, and then 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two persons. The adults and those with substantive diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune systems have a greater risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommended that they stay in their homes as well as possible in the areas of the community affected by broth. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other healthal bodies began to replace the use of the term "social stability" by "physical existence" to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contacts while maintain social, or virtually dignity.
The use of the term "social distance" has been influenced by the suggestion that people should adopt a full social isolation, instead of encourage them to keep contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines for use during pandemia.
They include recommendations of only having sexual relations with a person with whom it is convinced, which does not have virus or symptoms of virus.
The home self-alimentation was recommended for those who have been diagnosed the COVID-19 and who suspected that they have been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-alimentation, and many Governments have requested or recommended the self-employed populations in the areas concerned.
The most strict self-commerce instructions were issued for those belonging to high risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or a generally transmitted region are recommended to make a self-commerce for 14 days since the last possible exhibition.
Strategy to control a brown is the content or removal and mixation.
The container is carried out in the first stages of the breast and has the purpose of identifying and isolating infected persons, in addition to introducing other infection control measures to prevent disease from the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the dissemination of disease, efforts are transferred to the mixation phase: measures are taken to strike the propagation and to mitigate their effects on the health system and society.
A combination of maintenance and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.

On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100 000 maskers in Cuba.
The United States authorities were also accused of sending aid for other countries to their own country.
And discussions were reported between the maskers between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
Furthermore, Turkey invade hundreds of breathers for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the Coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, ambassador of Italy before the European Union, said: "Solo China has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin provided that the Russian army sent military doctors, special desinfection vehicles and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Prespa quoted an anonymous "Political Source of High-level" which stated that 80% of Russia's aid was "inutile or unnecessary use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of employing an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The President of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mai, disappeared the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a loading aircraft to the United States.
Cremlin's portal, Dmitry Peskov, said: "In offering support to U.S. colleagues [Putin], the United States manufacturers of medical materials and equipment can also match if necessary."
The planned military exercise of the OTAN "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the most largest war exercise of NATO since the end of the Friday War, will be carried out at a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise of the Defender 2020: "In the current crisis of public health, the lives of the United States and the various European countries participating, but also those of the peoples of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two decades of infected parliament members, and over 15 other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rohani, wrote a public letter to the world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country is having difficulties to fight the brochure because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the sanctions of the United States against Iran. The blog encouraged the demand that the United States should adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, family licensation and higher levels of public health.
Political analysts expected that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election opportunities in the 2020 presidential election, and diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea were deteriorated because of pandemia.
South Korea criticized the "ambiguous and passive negotiations" of Japan, after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will be in quarentery for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
The South Korean society was polarized in terms of the response of Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to require the Destitution of Moon for a bad manner of breast by the Government, or to join their response. The pandemic allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation.
Some comments expressed concern that governments could strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the first minister, Victor Orbán, to rule decree indefinitely, suspend the Parliament and the elections and sanctions to those who are considered to have distributed false information on the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
The coronavirus brote was condemned in several cases of lack of supply, as a result of the greatest use of machines to combat breasts, acquires stimulated by the panic and interruptions of logistics and manufactures.
The Administration of Food and Medicines in the United States has published warnings on the lowness of medicines and medical equipment because of the most demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several locations also occurred purchases that were stimulated by the panic which left the empty strands of essential products, such as food, hygienic paper and water, which caused the shortage of supply.
The technological sector has, in particular, been warned about delays in electronic products sending.
According to the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom, the request for personal protection teams has increased 100 times.
This request generated an increase in the prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in providing medical articles.
He also caused a low number of personal protection teams throughout the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers in danger.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to buy shopers to sell Australian products in China.
In spite of the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the northern Italy and the Whan region, and of the following demand for food products, no of these areas had been affected by the augmentation of food.
The measures of China and Italy against the illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been successful and have prevented a deep shortage of food expected in Europe and North America.
The northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to the sector representatives.
Food stars were only temporaryly empty, even in the city of Whan, while Chinese government officials freed the sweet meat reserves to ensure the sufficient food of the population.
There are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergency.
The damage in the world economy was seen in China: According to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop virus propagation, and minorist sales fell to 20.5 per cent.
Since the continental China is an important economic and manufacturer centre, viral breast has been considered a significant threat to destabilization for global economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit Agathe has pronounced that the markets will remain volatile until there is a clearer image on potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of epidemics on global growth could exceed the SARS broth of 2002-2004.
A estimate of an experts at the University of Washington at San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 million in the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.

On 24 February, global value markets caused significant increase in the amount of COVID-19 cases outside China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns on the coronavirus brothing, several U.S. Buruntyl Indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow=1191 points, the largest falling one day since the financial crisis 2007–08.
The three indexes ended the week with lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH declared China's sovereign credit qualification, but maintained a negative perspective.
The action was again under the basis of fears by the coronavirus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a economic recession likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian expressed the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they have reacted to the 2008 financial failure.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments to not travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights because of the smallest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airport Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cross-border enterprises has never reached a level.
A number of rail stations and transborders terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic corresponded to the Chunyun, a major time of travels related to the New Chinese Year's holidays.
several events in which large multitudes participated were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year Festivals, while private enterprises also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Year have been closed to avoid the massive concentrations, including the Prohibited City of Peking and the traditional temple holidays.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's feast until 10 February, and ordered to most of the workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of the GDP and 90 per cent of the export of the country.
Hong Kong took its level of response to the highest infected disease and declared an emergency, closed schools up to March and cancelled its New Year's celebrations. The minorist sector had been affected at the global level, with reductions in the care or temporary closures.
Visits to minorities in Europe and Latin America reduced 40 per cent.
Migrants of North America and the Middle East experienced a decline from 50 to 60 per cent.
This also occurred a decline of 33 to 43 per cent in the Peaton transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the commercial centres worldwide set additional measures, such as higher hygiene, the establishment of the thermal scanners to control the temperature of purchasers and the cancellation of events. According to a estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, pandemic recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America that had been in this situation without pandemia.
In January and February 2020, during the highest epidemic point in Whan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the almost 300 million rural employees from China have been changed in their homes in provinces of the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The coronavirus brochure could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent, according to estimates of the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confidence in India has left decades of Indian migrant workers (which receive daily salary) and 44 per cent of Canadian homes experienced some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British employees requested universal credit plans. About a half million companies in Germany have implemented short-term working schemes, known as Kurzwork, for their workers.
The German work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of scenic arts and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by pandemics, which highlighted the operations of organizations and persons, both employed and independent around the world.
The organizations of the culture sector and arts were trying to perform their mission (freely financed with public funds) to provide it to the community access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacles and other cultural institutions were indefinitely closed, and their exhibitions, events and spectacles were cancelled or posted.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent result and that increases the rapidized ritm of disease is the cancellation of religious services. important sports events and other social events such as music and concert festivals, technologie conferences and modest defilements.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Santa Semana celebrations in Rome, which have been held during the last week of the Cristian Penitity Time of the Quaresma.
Many dioceans have recommended that older Christians remain in their homes instead of taking the mixes; some churches offer religious services through radio, transmission in life through the Internet or television, while others offer rooms to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic diocess of Rome to close its churches and heads and with the Plaza of San Pedro empty of Christian peregrinos, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mixes, synagogues, temples and gardens.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of the vineyards in the areas affected by the breast and then closed the sanctuarys, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the income of foreign dangers and their residents to the sacred places in the Meca and Medina.
Pandemia has caused the most significant change in the world sport calendar since the Second World War.
The major major sport events were cancelled or posted, among them, the EUFA 2019–20 Championship Liga, the First League 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA time and NHL’s 2019–20.
The brochure interrupted the Olympic Games 2020 plans that were originally designed to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "reprogramme for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." The casinos and other game places in the whole world were closed and online poker tours were posted or canceled.
This caused many ambassadors towards Internet, many online sites informed significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concerts rounds.
Many large teachers, such as Broadway, also suspended all the spectacles.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional life spectrum, such as concert transmissions or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet, so that artists interpret, distribute or publicize their work.
Online, numerous internet owns were distributed on the coronavirus, as many react to humor and distraction in the midst of the incertidum.
Since the COVID breast, a increase in prejudiciary, xenophobia and racism has been observed towards Chinese and Asian descendants, and to people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asian region and the Pacific.
Reports of February (the majority of the cases still were limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world that expressed that Chineses were merely a virus or that were receiving what they considered to be just reprise.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Whan and Hubei have informed discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside this.
After the progress of the brochure towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country of Europe who experienced a serious COVID 19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenofobia. The citizens of countries like Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed requests for the ban of Chinese income to their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trend on Twitter.
China, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, has informed more racist insults, in addition to aggressions.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized by referring to the Coronavirus as the "China Virus", a term that many critics considered racist and ancient.
Managers in Ukraine attacked buses that transported Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Whan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the northeastern India, who shared a border with China, and who studied in the main Indian cities, suffered awesome in relation to the coronavirus broth.
The Chairman of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengala Dilip Ghosh expressed that the Chineses had destroyed the nature and "for that reason, God has blessed from them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcuta then condemned the comments and said they were "hero" in China, increased xenofobia and racism to non-Chine residents as a result of pandemia, and was described to foreigners as "foreign base" and intended for "desecho".
Many newspapers with payment walls left them for parts or the totality of the coronavirus cover.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles available with open access.
Some scientists opted to share their results quickly into preprint servers like bioRxiv.

The laboratory tests for the respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those who detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by testing polymerara string with inverse transcriptase, which detects the ARN of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Anticorps tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too weak symptoms as to inform them or were asintomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Because of the limited tests, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there are large variations in the amount of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affected by the letality rates for informed cases, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
Through the reaction of polymerara string with reverse transscriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained by several methods, including nazophringe hypothesis or spot samples.
The results are generally available within a period of some hours to 2 days.
The test of reaction in the polymerara string with inverse transcriptase carried out with pharmageous hyophodes is only reliable in the first week of illness.
Afterward, the virus can disappear in the gargant, but it continues to be multiplied in the pulmones.
In persons infected to which the test is performed in the second week as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the breathing ways by cutting up, or the material that will be excluded by toser (spot).
One of the first tests of polymerase reaction tests was developed in Charity, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerara chain reaction with reverse transscription in real time (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of the 250 000 Kits distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Koenbiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction of clinical polymerasis (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Search the "E" gen, shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific SARS-CoV-2 gen RdRp. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies in obtaining the emergency approval of the National Medical Products administration of China a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymera cabin reaction. In the United States, the Headquarters for Control and Prevention of Nurse (CDC) are distributing its reaction diagnostic panel in the field of polymera with inverse scripts in real time for the new coronavirus (2019-19) to the public health workers of the International Resource Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unconcluded results because of defectuous reactions, and an overwhelming in testing in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, at the average, less than 100 samples were processed daily throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests used by two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only since then state and local laboratorys were allowed to start carrying out tests.
The Food and Medicine Administration approved the test under emergency authorisation, and the US Trade Laboratory began to test at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced the availability at national level of COVID-19 tests based on the reaction of polymerarasa with inverse transcripts.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided tests for COVID-19 at national level.
No limits were announced in the amount; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Attention Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the adoption of the ADA for a test that could be performed within a large period of 3,5 hours, which allowed a machine to perform about 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued emergency use authorisation for Abbott Laboratory for a test in the m2000 system; previously, the FDA had issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorrp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepcity received the FDA ' s emergency use authorisation for a test which delays about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test using the isothermal expansion technology of nuclear acids instead of polymerara reaction.
Since this does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Today, there are some 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott intend to increase the production to perform 50 000 tests per day. In Taiwan, it is developed a test that uses a monoclonal antibodies that is specifically a protein of the new coronavirus (protein N) protein, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as a fast test for the influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "the torax radiographs have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computeralized tomography] may be obtained even before the symptoms appear."
The typical features in the TC include bilateral multi-lotable opacity in the displayed view with a peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution.
As the illness progress is developed, sub-plural domain, implanted pattern and consolidation is developed.
According to a study carried out in Whan, in the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the reaction of polymeraraa was compared to the computerized tomography, the computer-tomography is much more sensible than the reaction in polymera string, although less specific, and many of the features in images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not use the computerized tomography as a method of detection or a first line test to diagnose COVID-19." From March 2020, CDC recommends the reaction in the polymera chain as an initial review.
part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to detect infection in persons nearly from 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and supervision of the population.
Automatized high performance systems in many clinical laboratorys can perform these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analysis, generally only one spectrum of peripheral blood is used, although serial specimens can be used to follow immunity response.
For the tests in the care point, generally one type of blood is obtained by a punishment in the skin.
Unlike polymerase reaction methods, there is no need for extraction before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the Agency as corresponding, and therefore, they can now distribute their anti-corps tests.
On April 7, 2020, only a test was approved by the FDA in an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the approval of Europe for its test kits, which can detect the anti-virus anti-IgG and IgA anti-virus in blood samples.
Testing capacity is of several hundred samples in the time period and therefore is much higher than the conventional reaction test in the virus ARN polymerarase.
Ancients, generally, can be detected 14 days after the infection begin. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that no of the anti-corporate test kits was sufficiently good as to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives to the patient a tube for sperm," the patient is infected in the tube, sent it and obtained a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspect cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infectes others if he goes to the hospital or the need to defeat a ambulance if it is used. In the tests in the COV-19 drive centers, a health professional takes evidence of the appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres helped South Korea to make some of the most rapid and broader tests in any country. In Germany, the National Medical Medical Association of Health Insurance Association said on 2 March that there was a capacity for approximately 12 000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that 10 700 people had been tested in the past week.
Health insurance costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered through the drive-through system in various large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, at the natural week of 12/20, at least 483 295 samples were analyzed, until and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6,9%), the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Technion Institute and the Hospital Rambam have developed and tried a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only to make more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On February 5, 2020, Whan, the BGI inaugued an emergency laboratory of 2000-foods called "Hu-Yann" (Hu-Chine: "Fournishing" or "Fourth of 10,000".
With the construction, which was supervised by the BGI founder, Wang Jian, which led 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei were more than 47 per cent and that the relevant costs for addressing the quarentee were doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Whan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratorys were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Pekin and Shanghái, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 patients samples for COVID19 using only 93 analysis. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratorys without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
For March, the lack and the insufficient reaction amounts affected the massive tests in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that implies to calendar samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN's genome to make more evidence. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had now made more evidence of coronavirus detection in their population than any other country, and was intended to increase the level of tests for the majority of the population.
This has been achieved through the combination of the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a massive production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency detection laboratorys in China).
Construction in 14 days, the laboratory has the ability to perform decades of thousands of reaction tests in the polymerara chain with inverse transcripts per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Several test forms have been developed to address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that sent to countries of low income that had no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses was not available until 28 January, which has delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the fiability of the test kits at the principles of the broth, and these countries and Australia had not been able to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of the health experts on tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of South Korea's tests helped to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity for testing, especially in the private sector laboratory, in the course of several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested the increase in test performance programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID pandemic. The high demand of tests due to the wide dissemination of the virus caused a delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratorys of the United States, and the supply of hisophodes and chemical reactions were exhausted.
In March 2020, China informed problems with the exactness of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; then the government removed the burocratic barriers that had avoided the realization of private tests. Spain purchased test kits to China Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but obtained the necessary results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be to the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Minister of Spain said he would remove the wrong results and replace them by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Tschech Republic purchased to China were wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1,2 million Kits to China that were essential.
The first minister Matovič suggested that they were shocked to Danubio. Atesh Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased to China had a "high error tax" and did not "speak them". The United Kingdom purchased 3,5 million test kits in China, but, at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they did not serve.
The realization of tests complemented by the quarter of those who obtained positive results and the identification of people with whom they had contacted positively in SARS-CoV-2, occurred satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, where the first death of COVID-19 was occurred in Italy, conducted two test rounds throughout the population of around 3400 people, with some ten different days.
Nearly half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases identified were placed in quarennium.
With the restriction of travels in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive attraction of contacts, travel restrictions from the outside, testing and quarter, the pandemia by coronavirus 2020 in Singapore has made much lower than in other developed countries but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced restaurants and minorist institutions.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend the residents who stay in their homes, but schools returned to open at time after the celebration of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled pandemia with the intensive raster of contacts, travel restrictions, testing and quarters, but with less strict confidence, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries who have performed more evidence in terms of the amount of death have letality rates for very lower cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect persons who have only weak symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries who have no capacity to carry out tests and have national laboratory with limited experience in the COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to some of the 16 WHO reference laboratorys to confirm tests.
From 16 reference laboratorys, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by the country's policy for testing.
A country that only performs tests in the hospital income will have a higher number of tests as % of tests than a country that performs tests in all citizens, whether symptoms or not, other issues are equal.
The lavage of hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of lavaging hands with the purpose of eliminating suicide, fat, microorganism or other unwanted substances.
The lavage of hands with jabon constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day predicts the propagation of many diseases, for example, diarea and colliera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral way.
People can also be infected with breathing diseases such as influenza or common refrigerator, for example, if hands are not lacked before the eyes, narrow or mouth (i.e. muscles).
The five critical moments during the day in which hands are important to be laid with jabble include: before and after the defectation, after cleaning the cubit of a child or changeing the ball, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a food or manipulating a crude meat, fishing or bird meat.
If there is no water or jabon, hands can be cleaned with cenizes. The World Health Organization recommends to lay hands:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a nursing person.
After changing swimming or cleaning a kid that used the bathroom.
After sleeping the nest, toss or exornate.
After touching animals, food for animals or animals' wastes.
The medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
The lavage of hands before administration of medicines or medical care may prevent or minimise the propagation of diseases.
The main medical goal of hand lavage is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, virus or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that may cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including minimizing the propagation of the influenza, coronavirus and other infected diseases; preventing diarrhoea infected causes; decrease respiratory infections;
and reduce child mortality rates in home parks.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that improvements in hand lavage practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, children ' s mortality rates related to respiratory and diarree diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple behavior changes, such as hands with jabon.
This simple action may reduce almost 50 % the mortality rate for these diseases.
Hand lavage interventions can reduce diarrhoea episode in a third part around, and this is similar to providing potable water in the areas of low income.
48% of diarrhoe episode reductions can be related to the lavage of hands with jabon. The lavage of hands with jabon is the most effective and economic way to prevent the diarrey and the acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities throughout the world.
Neumonia, a significant acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of a estimated amount of 1.8 million children per year are covered.
The diarrhoe and joint neumony represent almost 3,5 million children’s deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands with jabon before eating and after using the bath to a rare habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half of the deaths by diarrey and a fourth part of the deaths by acute respiratory infections.
The lavage of hands is generally integrated with other hygiene-related actions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of hands is also protected against the impetition, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of the lavage of hands is that their frequencies performance may cause cutaneous damage because of the skin's reaction.
According to a Danish study carried out in 2012, the overwhelming hand lacquer can cause a cutanea infection that causes picassoon and makes sketching, known as hands eczem or dematization, which is particularly frequent in health workers.
The lavage of too frequent hands is also considered one of the symptoms of the obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day in which the lavage of hands with jabon is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orinar, defense), after cleaning the ball of a child (spain changing), before feeding a child, before eating and before/or preparing or handling a crude meat, fishing or bird meat.
Other cases in which the lavage technique should be practied to prevent the transmission of diseases includes before and after treatment of a court or wound; after extraordinary, touching or sounding the nase; after touching animals or handling animals; and after touching skin.
In many countries, there is a low rate of lavage of hands with jabón.
A study on hand landing in 54 countries carried out in 2015 concluded that in the meantime 38.7% of the families practiced hands with Japan. In 2014, a study stated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States was near to half of 77 per cent; and China had the lower rate with 23 per cent. Today, there are different methods for change of behaviors, to increase the adoption of the lavage habit in Japan at the critical moments.
The "essential health care program" implemented by the Department of Education of Philippines is an example of a action to promote children's health and education.
Due times a year, in addition to lavaging hands with jabon every day, the dens to daily with fluorur are the basis of this national programme.
It has also been immediately implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of the microorganisms of the skin improves when adding to jabons or detergentes.
The main action of jabons and detergents is to reduce the barriers for solution and to increase solution.
The only water results in inefficacy to clean the skin because grass and proteins, which are components of the organic material, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid jab, due to its reuseable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria of the contaminated jabon concluded that transfer is unlikely, since bacteria are injured with the spum.
Even so, CDCs claim "that is preferable to the liquid jabon with controls for dispensation that do not imply to use the hands."
Antibacterial jabons have been intensely promoted for a conscious public of health.
There are no evidence to demonstrate that the use of the recommended desinfects or anti-synthetics maintain resistant organisms to natural antibiotics.
However, antibacterial jabons contain common antibacterial agents such as tricloshan, which have an extensive list of cepas of resistant organs.
Thus, even if antibacterial jabons do not keep the resistant cepas to antibiotics, they may not be so effective as promoting.
In addition to the surfacting and protecting skin, the formulal sophisticate can contain acids (actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobic activity and more additive for skin (aloe, vitamins, mentl, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that common jabons are efficiency as the antibacterious jabons that contain trickles to prevent diseases and eliminate the bacteria of hands.
The pleasant water for washing hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bakteries grow much more faster than body temperature (37 °C).
However, the yellow tibia water is more effective than the cold water to remove natural oils that restore land and bacteria.
However, in contrast to the popular faith, scientific studies have demonstrated that the use of Tibia water has no effect on the reduction of microbiological load in the hands.
A desinfectant for hands or antiseptics for hands is a without water agent for the hygiene of the hands.
At the end of 1990 and at the first part of the 21th century, anti-septic solution for hands to flee or desinfects for hands began to purchase popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl alcohol or etanol formulated with a speeding agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or humidant like glucerine in a liquid, or spumb for easy use and to reduce the impact of alcohol resequence.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. The desinfectants for hands containing 60 to 95% alcohol at least eliminate germes effectively.
Alcohol desinfectants eliminate bacteria, resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (including HIV, herpes, RSR, rinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and hungry.
Alcohol desinfectants that contain 70 per cent of alcohol eliminate 99.97 per cent (reducing 3,5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after the application and 99.99% to 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 logaritmos) of bacteria in the hands of 1 minutes after the application.
Desinfectants for alcohol hands are practically inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of the contagious gastroenteritis. It should be used sufficient solutions to anti-septic hands or to frozen alcohol, such as to hume or cover both hands.
The palm and the dorse of both hands, between the dents and the extremes of all dents shall be frozen for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the spum or the gele sequence.
The thick points should also be laid down well, frozen them in both palms. The United States Control Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses recommend the lavage of hands before the desinfectants for hands to flee, especially when the hands are visiblely sweet.
The increased use of these agents is based on its use facility and the rapid activity of the elimination of microorganisms; however, it should not be used as a substitute of adequate hands that are not available from water or jabin.
The frequency use of desinfectants for alcohol hands can reselect the skin, unless they add emotic or hydroactive for the skin to the form.
Alcohol sequence effects can be reduced or eliminated by adding glucerine or other emotics to the form.
In clinical trials, the desinfectants for alcohol hands containing emotics caused irritation and sequence of the skin significantly less than jabons or antimicrobic detergentes.
Allergic dematite per contact, urticary syndrome by contact or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in solutions for alcohol based hands are very few.
The smallest tendency to cause irritating dematite by contact resulted attractive in comparison with the lavage of hands with water and jabon.
Despite their efficiency, without water agents do not eliminate the organic material of the hands, but simply desinfect them.
For this reason, the desinfects for hands are not so effective as water and jabon to prevent the propagation of many pathogens, since pathogens remain in the hands.
The efficacy of alcoholless hands depends largely on ingredients and forms, further historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol solutions to frozen.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalconium chlorure have persistent and accumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, at the different level of alcohol, whose efficacy reduces after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income communities can not buy jabon and use in changing cenizons or land.
Cenizes or land may be more effective than the only water, but less effective than the jabon.
A concern is that, if the land or cenizes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the propagation of diseases instead of reducing it.
Like the jabon, the ceniz is also a desinfective agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommended use of grain or sand as an alternative to jabn when no jabon is available.
The correct technique for the lavage of hands recommended by the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Diseases to prevent transmission of diseases include the following steps:
Moving your hands with a swimming water tissue or cold.
It is recommended that the flowing water is recommended because the water samples with stainless water can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water looks like does not make any difference.
The hands are broken to form a spum with a generous amount of jabón, including the hands of the hands, between the teeth and under the skins.
The jabon removes the skin gems, and the studies show that people are most thrilling their hands when they use jabnon when they use the water alone.
Return for at least 20 seconds.
Restrict creating friction, which helps to remove skin gems, and restrict for longer periods to remove more germs.
Enjoy well with flowing water.
Jumping in a tube can again pollute your hands.
Search with a clean tube or let the air sick.
Hume and mood hands are again contaminating with more facility. The parts that are more often forgotten are pulling, munching, areas between the dogs and under the skins
The artificial skins and the smalt of discovered skins can accommodate microorganisms.
It is often recommended to prevent the hands to react; skin skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate the lavage of hands when there is no flowing water or jabon, for example, to spend water from a swimming bid, or to use suitable or smell if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to earn water, such as "hospital griffs" and other economic options.
A household grip is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a sog and a swimming palm with the feet to see a small amount of water on the hands and a bar jabon.
The effective hand sequence is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a certain debate on the way of the public baths most effective.
There are more investigations that indicate that paper tubes are much more hygienical than electric hand sequentors that are in many baths.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study by the association of the European Paper Toilets Industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm air sequencies and the most modern air crystors.
After wearing and pulling the hands with the heat air sequentor, it was found that the total amount of bacteria was averagely increased by 194 per cent in the eggs and 254 per cent in the palms.
A mean increase in the total volume of bacteria of 42 % in the eyemas of the dents and of 15 % in the palms.
After wearing and pulling hands with a paper tube, the total volume of bacteria was meanly reduced by 76 per cent in the eggs of the teeth and 77 per cent in the palms. Scientists also performed evidence to determine whether there were cross-contaminated possibility of other bathroom users and the environment of the bathroom as a result of each type of secale method.
The air chorr by air, which swings air from the unit to speed, as it is stated, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), slowed the microorganisms of hands and units and potentially polluted other bathroom users and the bathroom environment to a distance up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air secator propaged the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of the secator.
Paper towels did not demonstrate significant propagation of microorganisms, and in 2005, in a TÜV product and environmental study, different hand sequence methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacteria count after the hand sequence:
There are many manufacturers of different hands manufacturers, and hand sequentors have been compared to the secator with paper tubes.
Hands with desinfect tolls for hands are an alternative during the trips, when there is no water or jabin.
Desinfecting for alcohol hands must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The hand lack of doctors became too obligatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis would discover its effectiveness (1846) for prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
E-mail devices provide comments to remember the hospital staff members who lay their hands when they are forgotten.
A study tested a reduction in infection rates with its use.
The physician hand laundry is performed at least 15 seconds, with a lot of water and jabon or glass to shape and limit all the hands.
Hands must be restricted together by interrupting the teeth.
If there are rests under the skins, you can use a skin cell to remove them.
Since gems can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to kick them well and cut them with a clean tube.
After the sequence, the paper tube should be used to close the water (and open any outdoor if necessary).
This prevents the hands again to be contaminated by these surfaces.
The purpose of laating hands in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms and to avoid transmitting them.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lavage of hands is still unacceptable in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that the correct lavage of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the blood torrent infection rates related to 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a shell in which the lavage of hands and the standard hands flowing in the medical care sectors is shown.
The preliminary version of the guide for the organisation's hand hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Trade devices may measure and check the hand hygiene, if the demonstration of the regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "five moments" for the lavage of hands:
After the exposure to corporal blood or liquids
before an aseptic work and
The addiction of anti-septic chemicals in the jabon ( "medicinal" or "antibacterians") involves the possibility of eliminating the hand lavage agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or around which are very frequently resistant organs to antibiotics. To lavage hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to contain a grip that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a little clorhexidine or yode for lava, sterilized towels to dry the hands after the lavage, a sterilized sterilized cepillo to be cleaned and another sterilized instrument to be cleaned under the skins.
All the jokes must be removed.
This procedure requires the hands and fronts to the cot, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to lavage for a long time (10 minutes).
When slaughtered, the water of the fronts should be avoided to return to the hands.
After the lavage, the hands are seated with a sterilized pan and a surgical battle is placed.
To reduce the propagation of germs, the hands are better laid or use a anti-septic for hands before and after attending nurses.
In order to control the infections caused by stable infections in hospitals, it has been confirmed that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of the lavage and that is very poor when hand hygiene is increased by 35%.
In comparison with the lavage of hands with a solution to alcohol with hand lavage with a antibacterian jab for a medium of 30 seconds, it was observed that the frozen with alcohol was reduced by 26% more than the antibacterial jabine.
However, water and jabon are more efficient to reduce the virus of H1N1 and the hard Clostridium spors of the hands than the desinfectants for alcohol-based hands. Hand hygiene in health care centres can enhance the capacity for hands lavage personnel, increase the availability of desinfecting for hands on the basis of alcohol and written and oral recorders to staff.
There is further need to investigate what such interventions are the most effective in the various health care environments.
In developing countries, the lavage of jabon hands is an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, jabnon or installations to lavage hands in homes, schools and jobs makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand lavage conductes.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few griefs to lavage the hands near public or private retreats, although there are economic options to build hand landing stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be the result of rare habits and not the lack of jabon or water.
Promoting the labour of hands with jabón can affect political decisions, increased consciousness of the benefits of hand landing and cause a long-term behavior change in the population.
In order to function effectively, it is necessary to follow and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, the Community approaches are effective to increase the lavage of hands in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. A example of promoting hand lavage in schools is the "Third stars" approach of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students lay hands with Japan, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can eventually pass from one to three stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations may be part of the main lavage campaigns that are carried forward to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Manos is another example of concientization campaign that is trying to make a change of behavior. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF emphasized the creation of an emoy for the lavage of hands.
A few studies have considered the overall income of hand lacking in developing countries in relation to prevented AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that the promotion of the lavage of jabin hands is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have finished giving light to or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised by the mid-seventh century by two pioneers of the hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "funder of modern nurse".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant eyes called mysmas.
In the 1980s, food and health care browns brought to the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Diseases to promote the hygiene of hands more actively as an important way to prevent infection.
The sugar grip broth in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made more awareness about the importance of lavaging the hands with jabon to protect these infected diseases in many countries.
For example, in Germany, cards were set with "good technicians to lavage hands" together with public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The word "slaper your hands" is a statement that you don't want to be charged of something or to share the complexity of something.
He has its origin in the Matteo’s Bible passage, where Poncio Pilato was laid his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but he has become a more wide expression of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to lay the hands in a compulsory way in an attempt to purify a imaginative piece, which represents his consciousness of guilty about the crimes that he had done and who had led to his husband to act.
It has also been confirmed that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethics actions, people tend to lavail their hands more often than others and aim to evaluate the elements for the lavage of hands.
In addition, those who have allowed to lavail their hands after that reflection are less likely to be involved in other compensatory "purity" actions, such as voluntary.
The religions recommend the lavage of hands with hygienical and symbolic purposes. The lavage of symbolic hands, with water, but without japon, is part of the lavage of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaiism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat anddaim in Judea, the lavatorium in Christianism and wuda in Islam. Religions also recommend the lavage of hygienical hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam binding hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sisiism, Jewishism and Islam bind their hands before and after each food.
Risk controls at work at COVID-19
Risk controls in the workplace of COVID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational hygiene and safety methodologys in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls in the workplace are dependent on the workplace and the work task and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the seriousness of disease in the community and the risk factors of employees that can be used to oppose COVID-19.
According to the United States Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) work with less risks of exposure has minimum working contact with the public and working partners, for which the measures for prevention of basic infections, including the lavage of hands, the recommendation of workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a cleaning and desinfection of the working environment.
Works with a mean exposure risk include those who require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or suspect that have COVID-19, but who may be infected by the existing Community transmission or by a international journey.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a great concentration of people and some major minority sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high efficiency air filters, protective coverages and individual protection equipment available in the case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that health care and funding workers, exposed to people who know or suspected that they have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exhibition, if they carry out procedures that can generate aerosols in persons who know or suspect that they have COVID-19 or take or handle samples of these people.
Risk controls for these workers include Engineering controls, such as negative pressure rooms, and individual protection equipment for workers.
COVID breasts may have a variety of consequences on the workplace.
Workers may lack the job because of sickness, because they need to care for others or fear of the possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which goods are required as the means of purchasing such goods (such as buying in hours that are not pico, by means of home-to-place or by ventilation from the car).
Finally, the posts of articles from serious geographical areas affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparation plan and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans are addressed to risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors resulting from domestic and Community environments and the risk factors of individual workers, such as older or chronic medical actors.
They also describe the controls required to address these risks and the contingent plans for situations that may occur as a result of the breasts.
Plans for preparation and response to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of response to a brochure, there is a reduction in the transmission between staff members, the protection of persons who have more risks to suffer contrary health complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the minimising of adverse effects in other entities of their supply chain.
The seriousness of disease in the community in which the company is affected by the measures taken.
Risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their efficiency.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be removed, the most effective controls are Engineering controls, followed by administrations and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Ingeniry controls implies to isolate workers' risks without recurring to the behaviour of workers and may be the most rewardable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures required for action by employee or employee.
The individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but they can help to prevent some exposure.
All types of individual protection equipment should be selected on the basis of the danger for the employer, put as appropriate (e.g. respirators) to be used in a proper and systematic way, to be revised frequently, to receive maintenance, to replace whether it is necessary and to be removed, cleaned and stored or deleted in a proper manner to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Health and Security Administration (OSHA), work with less risk of exposure has minimum working contact with the public and working partners.
The measures for prevention of basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of deep and frequent hands, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are nursed, the respiratory hygiene standards that cover to the tube and extraordinary, the provision of paper pupils and containers for dishes, the preparation for the telecarriage or the shooted rounds if necessary, the dissuasion of workers to use instruments and agents and equipment, and the maintenance of a cleaning routine and defectation of the surrounding work.
The identification and immediate isolation of persons that may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others.
The Centres for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptom during at least 24 hours without taking medicines to eliminate symptoms or reduce fever; that the license policy of disease licensing may be flexible and authorized to employees to stay at home to care for a nursing family, and that employees are familiar with these policies.
According to the OSHA, work with a mean exposure risk includes those who require frequent contact or nearly six feet (1.8 m) with people who do not know or are suspected that they have COVID-19, but that they could have been counted by SARS-CoV-2 because of the Community’s transmission of the company around the time, or because the person has recently traveled a international journey to a generally transmission of COVID-19.
This includes the workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, the working environments with a lot of people's concentration and some of the major minority environments. Intelligence controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increased risk of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the transparent plastic protection cables and the place of a ventilator for the service of care that the customer can ask from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the greater risk groups are recommending the workers that we are in the home, replacing meetings by virtual communications, establishing anxiety of the survey of the older sisters who are overwhelming the older age of the WWWs, and who are assaulted by the elders of the ancestors of the ancestrators, and the ancestrators of the ancestors of the ageshers of the ages of the ages.
The workers of this group of risk must use breathers.
If a person is sick in a flight, the appropriate controls for protecting workers and other passengers include separating the nursing person from the other to a distance of 6 feet, designating a member of the tripulation to the nursing person and offer a mask to the nursed person, or request him to cover the mouth and the nariz with paper puzzles when it is shocked or extreme.
Cabin tripulation must use decreased surgical guiding to attract a nursing passing or to touch body fluid or surfaces possiblely contaminated and, perhaps, individual protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, its persistent or difficulty to breathe.
In the case of the commercial navigation, such as crosses and other ships transporting passengers, risk controls include posting travel by disease, self-defect and immediately informed to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms while it is on board.
In the case of schools and child care centres, CDCs recommend the short-term closure to clean or desinfect if a infected person was in the school building, independently of Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimum or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancel excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or corn or food classs in the eating, increase space between pupiters, scalling input and output time, restricting visits not essential and use a separate place for children who have grip symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For the staff of the police forces that carry out daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk for health is low.
Police officials who should contact those who have a confirmed or suspect of COVID-19 diagnosis are recommended to follow the same rates as emergency physicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and desinfect their workshops and their teams with a aerosol or toalites of home-use cleaning before returning to use them and follow the standard operational procedure for containing and decrease of the personal protection equipment and the content and landing of the clothing.
OSHA believes that some health workers and morgers are within high or very high risk of exposure.
Among high risk works of exposure, there are workers of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport that are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19.
These are converted into work of very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19 or if they take or handle samples of these patients.
Some aircraft generation procedures are the intubation, the tube induction procedures, the broncoscopias, some dent procedures and reviews or the invasive samples.
High-risk morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of chambers of persons with COVID-19 or who suspected that they may have it at the time of death; they have a very high risk of exposure if they carry out autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, even when they are performed aerosol generation procedures.
The specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some environments of medical and morgue care.
The samples should be manipulated by taking precautions of Biosegurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who ingress are separated in different waiting rooms on the basis of suspect or not to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of maskers for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been counted or suspected that SARS-CoV-2 has been counted by SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 breathers should be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of an integral written respiratory program including tests of adjustment, training and medical examination.
Other types of mass may provide greater protection and improve the competitiveness of the employer. WHO does not recommend the use of protector monkeys, since COVID-19 is an respiratory disease, not one transmitted by corporate fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical masker for patients who income.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport without implementing aircraft generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of chirurgic maskers, sweet or facial, battle and gants.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical masker must be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory.
Since the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends to reduce the need to use them, replace them by telemedical, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the income permit to a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without retirering it while the attention is given to several patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personnel protection equipment and the use of maskers by individuals.

ENVISH/HORA: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universal coordinated time
LICENCIA: CC0: Non-reserved rights
This month, we're in natural circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 shows our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented have not previously, but we know that our best roots in the coherence, cooperation and global Community construction that meet the nucleus of this organization.
The partnership and concern that we have seen among our partners in the e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible they are with whom we have the luck to work.
I couldn't feel more grateful and proud that you all are my partners.
Last week, someone shared my appreciation for our work.
They remembered how important it is for the world to listen to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available for all.
Your work makes this possible, either while maintaining the sites in function, helping our partners receive their payment or safeguard our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but the way we do it will have a deep effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and chronographs
As you mentioned before Robyn, the C team was gathered tonight to talk about our approach and our chronograph for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be a suitable response to what we are addressing and what would be the best way to maintain the organisation's sustainability at this time.
Moreover, we wanted to remove stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and workers with contract:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week, until next warning.
We are not declaring a feast; if you can work in a more normal time, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unprecedented place currently, and if you have to care for your loved ones, to purchase or to your doctor, our priority is your welfare.
We're not taking the account of your hours.
If he's sick, I don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to request a license for disease or free payment; only inform your manager and help your team to review the calendars and chronographs to ensure that they are covered by the key areas of the work.
(If you receive a positive COVID diagnostic, consult Bryan from T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and ensure that management is both of your situation).
People working for hour will receive total payment.
As we have said, we will renew our commitment with our contractors and staff partners who work for hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked in normal circumstances.
This is also applicable if you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use the work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly grateful, especially in those days.
This is again your personal care.
What we requested is that they are communicated with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt us correctly.
A number of works are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Site confidence Engineering teams, Human Resource Operations, Confidence and Security and Rebuilding Funds, among others, play critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and amend our approach to support what is essential for our mission.
There is enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing the speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "duplicate the time to put us on the day" when finishing pandemia.
It will not be expected that I work additional hours to meet terms that aren't already realists.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and terms when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or annual planning?
To adjust our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adapt the chronograph for the delivery of our annual planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to the budget so that employees can priorize the critical work, personal care and care of loved beings while adapting us to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced time during the next weeks.
This enlargement of our chronograph has greatly reduced the current loads of planning and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council in the week that we will come and report the next steps to delegations and teams only to be confirmed.
Thanks to the APP team for his leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we knew that one of our partners of the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautional measure, we contract a antivirus cleaning team to desinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to desinfect all surfaces, in addition to receipt and ascensors that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own protocol of care, using products supporting the safety of its employees.
We felt confidence that the office will be well prepared for when we decided to get back.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to an entirely remote environment in accordance with the shared rates with San Francisco.
As you already know some of our partners in the city of New York, we have also spoken about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still in progress, but it is possible to remain.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our partners who had already worked remotely since before know that this mode of modality requires an adjustment, thus providing the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings at intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If more long meetings are required, consider the way to select them in the course of several days.
Define clearly the meeting with a list of the topics and send the read materials with preview.
Adopt the use of the video in a default way, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and life connection.
Design a leader to modify each meeting, a person that controls questions on the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send a email message to technical support if you need comfortable auditors.
Use the repayment of well-being for refrigerators.
Enjoy the #remoties in Slack to talk to your partners about the distributed work
The RR.HH. Operations team is analyzing ergonomy rates based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This week we requested all the beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel public events financed by Wikimedia, such as editions, until WHO declares the end of pandemia.
We informed them that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could impede their part of the activities agreed for the subsidiary and that there would be no sanctions for the delay or amendment of these objectives.
This next week, we will follow additional tariffs in Wikipedia and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general sense of the community at the global level seems to be partly triste for interruption and, in part, encouraging the clarity and the ability to focus on its own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT will work to establish a page in Meta-Wiki in order to give you a space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID matters19
We will send you a invitation through your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00, universally coordinated time/07:00, time of the Pacific, for a special staff meeting.
We will use this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and pass time to connect us to each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help how we can.
At the same time, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all the information on one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently affected.
If you have any question about travels, events, a important flow of work, some covering problem or anything with which you can need help, do not doubt that you notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and function as link when necessary.
If you have confidential or delicate matters, send an email message to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of RR.H.
None of these changes should be considered a leave of our work and our obligations.
Instead of this, they are acknowledged that our work and our obligations must be adjusted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the necessary measures we believe to support us mutually in order to continue working, to give them our movement the necessary support and to provide it to the world the service in which he trusts.
Our planned work will continue there to be for us when the moment comes.
For now, it is time to support us mutually and make places for the important work that will come in the next weeks and, perhaps, in the next months.
We all need you so that this may be possible and therefore we need to care and care for your families so that you can be found in the best state when the needs emerge.
Now, please, lay your hands and don't touch the face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converter enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is a enzyme that is associated with the external surface (cellular membranes) of the pulmonary cells, artery, heart, rings and intestines.
ECA2 opposes the activity of the transformer enzim of angiotensine (ECA) related to reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increased angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic dialysis for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an input point for cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzim is generally called hECA2.
The converter enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metalenzyme containing zinc and is located on the surface of the endotelial cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal renal transporter of colectrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a single membrane protein of type I with its enzymaticly active domination exposed on the surface of pulmonary cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ECA2 is enclosed from the transmemberal domain by another enzym known as shelves and, as a result, the soluble protein is released in the blood torrent and, lastly, is excluded by the orine.
The ECA2 is presented in most organs: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the type II alveolear cells of the pulmonary cells, to the tumors of the detect intestino, to the coming arterial and endotelial cells and the arterial cells of the muscle lised in most organs.
The expression of MARN of ECA2 is also found in the brain cortex, the striking body, the hypotalym and the encephal throat.
The main role of ECA2 is to oppose ECA.
ECA listens to the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictory.
On the other hand, ECA2 scans the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis to form vasodilaterate angiotensine (1-7)), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also extract several other pepts, including [-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinarine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membrases from the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter and has been associated with the Hartnup disease.
As transmember protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells has a result of endocytosis and translated virus together with enzyme to endosomas that are within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of S protein by the hosted TMPRSS2 protein, the inhibition of which is currently investigated as possible therapy. This has led to some hypothesis that the reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help to combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory entities have recommended that ECA and BRA continue therapy standard .
A systematic methanalis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ECA inhibitors was a significant reduction of 34 per cent of the risk of neumonia compared to cases of control".
In addition, "the risk of neumonia was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ECA inhibitors and had a greater risk of neumonia, in particular those with brain accident and cardiac insufficiency.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also a reduction of mortality related to neumony, although the results were not so solid for the general risk of neumony."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary lesson and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in lechones with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopolisacarides.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes beyond the intercourse of the effect (during) of 24 hours.
Various findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the classic inhibitors of the retina-angiotensin system (inhibitors of the ≥) or in illnesses where angiotensin II is higher. rhECA2 infection was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help contact trace in response to the coronavirus pandemia 2019-2020, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") that could have been in contact with a container.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in certain territories and judicial areas.
several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact trail applications.
There have been concerns relating to privacy, in particular with regard to systems based on the ratio of the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register the proximity of a user to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to admit these applications directly based on Bluetooth on their IOS and Android operational systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore you are using a application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open code application and will be held to the government. In North Macedonia was launched "StopKorona!", a application based on Bluetooth to enhance exposure to potentially counted people and to provide a rapid response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the implementation of contact tracks was on a advanced development stage and that it would be available for its implementation in the next weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether application and the Singapore BlueTrace Protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geometrical application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnosis designed to ensure that they do not get out of their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Ingenie of the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application systems, including positive false and the possibility of efficiency if the adoption of the application is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the propagation of applications of the injury or damage, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus in its App Store to "official" or "reliable" organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the consequences of massive oversight through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to be deployed to be linked with the pandemia of coronavirus after the threat is passed.
International Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication to require limits to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportional";
monitoring expansion and monitoring should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID objectives-19;
the security and anonymation should be protected and should be evidenced of this protection;
digital supervisory should avoid excession of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protections should be implemented against abuse and citizens ' rights should be established to respond to that abuse;
The significant participation of all " relevant parties", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be obliged. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Sin Fronteras (Reporter without borderen, RSF) have also published lists of controls.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of continuing monitoring by removing the rastering mechanism of its operational systems when no longer needed.
In some countries, the location of networks was used instead of applications, which was eliminated both the need for downloading application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the trail based on networks was approved.
The solutions based on networks with access to local data are potentially significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use only central servers for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application to carry out the contact trail.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected raster information from various sources, including mobile device track data and transaction data with credit cards, and combined them to generate warnings via text messages for potentially contained persons.
In addition to using this information to warn possible contacts, the Government has also found the information on location available to the public, which is permitted due to large changes in the privacy laws after the MERS brothing in that country.
This information is available for the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, were considered to use centralized systems and privacy protection.
On 6 April 2020, the details have not been published.
The privacy protection trace of contacts is a well established concept, with a large number of publicationd investigations that are reset by at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen of experts groups were working in respective solutions of privacy, such as the use of Bluetooth of low energy (BLE) to record the nearness of a user to other cellular phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include the decentralized proximity raster to maintain privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the temporary contact numbers (TCN, known before as event numbers, CEN) and the protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact trace for the protection of privacy (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never get out of the device and all the packing happens on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has developed SafePaths, a platform for the use of technicians that protect privacy when collecting and using a location or intersection of routes to accelerate the propagation of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications outside control: how to maintain personal privacy during a epidemic" published in March 2020. Other similar efforts is the SafeTrace Enigma MPC platform, a company that develops private technologies that originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware technology that allows its users to share delicate location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several united groups around which was essentially the same approach and high-compatible protocols formed the World TCN Coalition in order to reduce fragmentation and allow global interoperability of raying and warning applications, a key aspect for the achievement of a broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol code used by its official governance.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies controlling the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact racing that, as they have assured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of the Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy cryptography.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system were also published.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementing instruments to create official coronavirus raster applications that protect privacy
Integration of this functionality directly in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plans to address the continuing and monitoring issues by distributing, first, the system through the updates of the operational system and then remove them in the same way when the threat occurred.
b'Reperfilation (as well known as reposition or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a medicine approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against the COVID-19 and convallery plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemical proteins, each of which has multiple linking sites.
The analysis of these unit sites provides the reasonable foundation for the project to develop an effective antiviral medication against COVID proteins-19.
Among the most important danese proteins of SARS-CoV-2, similar proteases are found to papine, polymerarase ARN directed by ARN, helicosis, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.

The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola's virus and infections by Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences later found that the remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple philosovires, neumovirus, paramethovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of antiviral treatment is the development of resistance by mutations that may result in more serious diseases and transmission.
Some initial studies suggest that remdesivir can have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are in place, including two directed by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for persons with moderate disease and one for those who have more serious disease.
There are in course three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo controlled and one without control (China, Canada) and one (Italia).

b'Una vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical tests, there are many in course to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was not expected to have a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes disease in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in security studies in phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A significant brochure was extended by the world in 2020, which has developed significant investments and research activities to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Determined in April, the requirements of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, implementing and global access.
In April, the CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technological platforms were investigating and developed at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the main platforms that were conducted at security studies in phase I, the following are:
Nucleic acid (ADN and ARN) (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (developer of Phase I and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to the ECPI scientists in April, 115 possible vaccines are in the initial development phases, of which 78 are confirmed in active projects (79, in accordance with the Milken Institute) and the others 37 are announced, but with little information available (as presumed that they are planning or developing).
A test in fase I or II performs pre-security and immunity tests, usually aleatory, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several places, while determined the most precise and effective doses.
Study III tests often include more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects that are produced with the optimal dose.
From the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020) 74 were still not evaluated in humans (mainly "preclinical").
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that he was investigating the potential of a molecular substance that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, informed the development of a similar part of the coronavirus with part funding of the Canadian Research Institutes in Health.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human tests are expected to start in July or August 2020.
Previously this week, The Guardian reported that the President of the United States. Donald Trump had offered CureVac a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19, whereas the German Government was denied.
On 17 March 2020, the US Pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced a association with the German BioNTech company to jointly develop a vaccine based on ARNm.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical tests, and clinical tests are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human tests of the final vaccine could start in the autumn.

The other partners of the CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are modern, Curvac, Inovio, Newvax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
London Imperial College investigators announced on 20 March 2020 that they had developed an ARN vaccine with authorisation against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a financing of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to combat COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian enterprises and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or not at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus broth is produced.
On 2 April 2020, the researchers of the University of Pittsburgh Medicine Faculty announced the tests of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, and said that "the vacuums of the SARS-CoV-2 subunit, which were administered by MNA, have received powerful responses to the specific antibodies of antigen (in rats) which were clearly two weeks after the vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Waterloo University Pharmacea faculty announced the design of a possible vaccine based on DNA as a probably natal pulvery.
Using bacteria, the DNA will be appointed to be replicated within human bacteria and to produce inocuous parts similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, together with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's computer resources.
Some vaccines have no specific effects.
This means that you can have benefits beyond the disease that they predict.
Another aleatorized test in Australia is trying to write 4170 health workers.
It is possible that vaccines that are developed are not safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific COVID-specific animal models, such as transgenicrats expressed by ECA2, other laboratory and non-human primates, show the need to contain biosafety measures for the manipulation of living virus and international coordination in order to ensure standardized security procedures.
Vacuums against OLG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine that protects against the GMO that has demonstrated being safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications 2005-2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of the GMO was a priority for Governments and public health agencies throughout the world, and there is no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing research on the GMO could be a useful model to develop vaccines and treatments against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, an anti-SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed the clinical tests in phase I in humans, other three were now, all of which were viral vectors, two addenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
The publications in the social media promoted a conspirative theory that the virus caused by COVID-19 was known and had already a vaccine.
The patents referred to by several social publications refer to existing patents for genetic and vacuum sequences for other coronavirus cepes, such as the coronavirus of the GLO.
b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectiocontagious disease caused by the coronavirus of the acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, tos and difficult to breathe.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarree, galant pain, loss of oil and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and start of the symptoms usually is of some five days, but it can vary between two and fourty days.
Although most of the cases result in weak symptoms, some progress to viral neumony and multi-organic insufficiency.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been recovered. Virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, generally through cups that produce towels, embraced or speak.
Although these shoes are produced to exhal, they usually fall to the floor or on the surface, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also be counted by touching a contaminated surface and then touch the eyes, narrow or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious for the first three days after the start of the symptoms, although the propagation is also possible before the symptoms and in the late phases of disease. The standard method for diagnostic is the reaction in polymerasis with inverse translation in real time (RT-PCR) of a hisophoid naopharingeous.
The use of maskers is recommended for those suspected that they have virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of maskers for the general public were different. Some authorities recommend that it is not used, others recommend that it be used while others require their use.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
The local transmission of disease was recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asthmatical or have similar symptoms to the grip, such as fever, tubes, fatigue and difficulty to breathe.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties to breathe, pain or pressure persistent in the skin, confusion, difficulty to walk and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are presented, you are recommended to get immediately medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the higher respiratory ways, such as storms, narrow bone and galant pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms have been identified, such as nausea, vomite and diarrea, in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented oppression in the skin and palpitations.
In some, disease has progressed in neumony, multi-organic insufficiency and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 usually is five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do it within 11,5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected persons present symptoms.
The role of these asthmatical portators is still not fully known; however, the preliminary evidence that may contribute to the propagation of the disease is suggested.
The percentage of infected persons who have no symptoms are unknown at the time and are being studied. The Corean Control and Prevention of Nursing (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of the confirmed cases continued asthmatical during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission began to include asthmatical cases in daily cases on 1 April. 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asthmatical when the test was performed.
The shock and the salt can have large viral loads.
Speak in high-speakest voice than when it is talking to a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth in the tuberculosis can make the kitchen trips 4.5 meters (15 feet).
While virus is not generally air transmission, the National Science Academy suggested that the transmission is possible through biological aerosols and explained that air collections in the past outside the people's sleeping were positive in viral ARN.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonal reanimation (RCP) may cause aerosolization of respiratory secrets and, therefore, air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of propaging by the faces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the symptoms start, the risk is low.
The European Health Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) explains that, although it is not clearly the facility with which it is distributed, a person generally infected to two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected during a day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel (IASI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99 % of cowboy.
However, this would be according to humidity and temperature.
The jabon and the detergent are also effective if they are used in the correct way. Jabin products degrad the lyrics protective skin of the virus and disable it, in addition to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium cloruro and clorohexin glucanate (a surgical desinfective), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, there were samples of saliva in a mean of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
The coronavirus of the serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of serious respiratory syndrome, which was isolated for the first time of three people with neumony connected to a group of acute respiratory diseases in Whan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus.
Out of the human body, the home jabine kills the virus because it returns his protective bottle. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The pulmones are the most affected organs of COVID-19, due to the ingress of anfitrion cells through the transformer enzyme of angiotensin type 2 (ECA2), which is increased in the alveolary cells of type II of pulmones.
The virus uses a special superprotein named "spill" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and to involve anfitrion cell.
In 12 per cent of the hospitalized infections in Whan, China, an acute cardiac injury was identified, which is more frequent in serious disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systematic inflammatory response and the disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease, but the acute injury of myocardio can be related to ECA2 receptives in the heart.
ECA2 receivers have a high expression in the heart and participate in their function.
A high thrombosis (31 %) and venereal tromboembolia (25 %) were detected in UCI patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to a bad prognostic. In the autopsies of COVID-19, difused alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrations with linfocytes were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epidemic cells expressing the ECA2 of the breathing ways, the patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of systematic hyperinflation.
In particular, it was observed that the GM-CSF secrets were associated with the reclutation of IL-6 secret monocytes and a serious pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, Linfocic infiltrated was also informed.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in polymerara string with reverse transscription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually made in samples of breathing ways obtained by a naopharinge hyophode; however, it is also possible to use samples of nasal or spoiled hyopides.
In general, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two different weeks and the results have very little immediately.
Chinese scientists achieved the isolation of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that the laboratorys of the world could develop in an independent way reaction tests in polymerase chain (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, anticarbon tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developed, but it was not widely used.
Experience in China with tests has shown that precision is only 60-70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States adopted the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to use it for that month. The diagnosis rates published by the Hospital Zhongnan University of Whan would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
Multiple multiplobulary options with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common in the initial phases of infection.
As progressing diseases may appear underpleural domain, disordered pattern (seven lobulliar rolling with variable alveolar filled) and consolidation.
A few data on microscopic lessons and COVID-19 physopathology are available.
The main patoological results of autopsis are the following:
Macroscopia: pluuritis, pericardites, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral neumony may be observed:
Level neumonia: pulmonary edema, neumocty hyperplasia, atypically large neumoctics, interstitutional inflamation with linfocytes infiltration and training of gigantic cells with multiple nuclears
Severe neumonia: alveolar damage (DAD) with divided alveolares.
The DAD is caused by the syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty (SDRA) and serious hypoxymia.
neumonia in curation: organising exducted in alveolare cavities and intersticial fibrosis
Sangre: deseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leucorytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection opportunities include resting in the house, avoiding places with many people, lay hands with water and jabon frequently by at least 20 seconds, have a good breathing hygiene and avoid touching eyes, narrow or mouth without having been laid down.
CDCs recommend to cover the mouth and the nase with a puzzle when touching or exhoruncing and, if not puzzle, use the internal part of the code.
A suitable hygiene of the hands is recommended after touching or extorting.
CDCs recommended the use of switch switching in public places, one of the reasons for limited transmission by asthmatical persons, and social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of persons infected with large schools and job groups by closing travels and cancelling multi-agency public meetings.
The distance rates also indicate that people should keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there is a vaccine until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is to prevent epidemic pipe, which is known as "planing the curva".
CDCs are also recommended to lay the hands frequently with water and jabon for at least 20 seconds, in particular after going to the bath or when the hands are visiblely sweet, before eating and after sleeping the nose, tower or exhoruncing.
They also recommend the use of a desinfect for alcohol hands with at least 60% of alcohol, but only when there are no water and jabine available. For areas where desinfectants for hands are not easy to get, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from etanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spots in the alcohol; "that is not an active substance for the hand antisepsie."
Glycerol is added as humble.
Patients are supported, which can include rehydration, oxygen treatment and treatment for other vital bodies affected.
CDCs recommend that those suspected that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxigenation (OMEC) has been used to address the respiratory insufficient problem, but benefits are still analyzed.
In order to improve immunity, a personal hygiene and a lifestyle and healthy food were recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have leak symptoms at the initial infection stage. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intentivistas and niomologists in the United States complemented the recommendations of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend commenttamol (acetaminofenofeno), instead of motherprofene.
The risk of transmission of virus, especially in health care environments, should be precautioned to reduce airlines such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that health care professionals care with people with COVID-19 put the patient into a air infection zone (IIR), in addition to use standard precautions, contact warnings and precautions for avoiding air transmission.
The recommended teams are slaughtered by EPP, mascarilla, protective predominant and medical tangents. When available, breathers prefer breathers (instead of maskers).
N95 maskers are approved for industrial environments, but FDA authorized its use through urgent use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect the parts that are in the air, such as powder, but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific bioological agent that is not referred to in the product indications.
When there is no available mask, CDCs recommend the use of protective cards or, as the latest resource, machine maskers.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently serious to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but one percentage of cases is it.
This type of respiratory support is actively studied for patients hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and has a certain evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow skin of high flow or positive bipression in breathing ways.
It is still not known if any of these two benefits the same benefit to those in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol parts compared to high flow skin. The serious cases are mainly given in adults (the older than 60 years and, in particular, 80 years older).
Many developed countries have no sufficient beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle rapidly increased COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 per cent was granted to intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed the mechanical support of ventilation and 1.4 per cent failed.
In China, about 30 per cent of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanic ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 presents a acute respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
respirators need to have different pressure control methods and PTTEs to maximize the supply of oxygen, since the risk of pulmonary lease associated with breather and neumotorax is reduced.
The oldest respirators may not contain high PPTE.
The survey on possible treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
remdesivir seems to be the most promiser.
While the development of new medicines can last until 2021, several medicines that are tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with serious disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of efficiency and security of possible treatment. FDA authorized an temporary authorisation to convaluate plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is in serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to treat disease brown.
Users should enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "strict contact" and, therefore, a potential risk of infection through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application recommends not only self-confidence, but also warns local health officials. The analysis of the information macrodata of cells, the facial recognition technology, the follow-up of mobile phones and the artificial intelligence is used to raise infected persons and those contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security agencies to raise mobile phone data of suspected persons to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarter and protect those who can enter into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, German Telekom shared the summary data of telephone location with the German Federal Governance Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent virus propagation.
Russia implemented the facial recognition technology to detect the incompliances of the quarennium.
The regional health Commissioner Julio Gallera said that mobile telephone operators have informed him that "in all ways, 40% of people continue to be moved".
The German Government carried out a weekend hackack of 48 hours with more than 42 000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxiety by the quarenty, the travel restrictions and the secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, solitude, health concern, stress and economic problems are a perfect torture for mental health and people's welfare."
The disease can follow a leaking evolution with few or without symptoms, so other diseases of higher respiratory ways, such as common refrigeration.
Level cases are often recovery within the two weeks, while serious or critical may last from 3 to 6 weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may run the risk of combating a serious infection by COVID-19 virus, in accordance with the data of other similar virus, such as COVID and SROM virus, but COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect pulmones and cause neumony.
In the cases of more seriousness, COVID-19 can quickly progress the syndrome of breathing water difficulty (SDRA) which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic choque and multi-organic insufficiency.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include seeps, coagulation and cardiac damage.
Coagulation change, specifically the increase in protombine time, has been indicated in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while renal change is observed in 4% of this group.
Nearly 20% of CODIV-19 people have high hepatic enzymes (aminotransferous).
According to the same report, the average time between the start of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the CIU, there was a average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of incredible cases, the average time from the demonstration of the first symptoms until death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.5 per cent and between women was 1,7 per cent.
The histoptopological exams of postmorm samples show alveolar damage with cell fibromixides in both pulmones.
Virus citopical changes were observed in neumocites.
The image of the pulmones was the syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty (SDRA).
In 11,8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted in high levels of troponine or a couple of hearts.
According to the U.S. March data, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a prerequisite infection, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates were different because of these regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
The inadequate census of less cases may make the mortality rate exceeded.
However, the fact that deaths are the results of cases undertaken in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1.4 times more possibilities to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more possibilities to need intensive care or to fall in comparison with non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a decrease of 20 to 30 per cent of the pulmonary capacity in some persons who have been recovered from the disease, and the images of the pulmonars suggest the impact of the organs.
This may also cause intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was noted whether previous infections generated an effective long-term immunity in persons recovered from disease.
It seemed that immunity is possible, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but recovered cases from COVID-19 that later have been positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed that they are a deterioration of persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered natural and animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but, for December 2019, the dissemination of infection was almost completely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, stated as the first date of the start of symptoms at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and at the time, in addition to the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time passed from the initial brochure and population features such as age, gender and general health.
In the end of 2019, WHO designated CIE-10 emergency codes U07.1 to deaths with confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with clinical or epidemiological COVID-19 without confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2. The letality rate reflects the amount of deaths shared by the amount of cases diagnosed in a timely period.
Based on the statistics of University Johns Hopkins, the global letality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
Other measures include letality rates in diagnosed patients (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed persons who die from a disease, and the rate of letality in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of infected persons (with or without diagnostics) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and continue to a specific population from infection to the resolution of cases.
Although not all infectioned people produce antibodies, the presence of these may provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the breast in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) already failed.
In Gangelt, the disease was propaged during the carnaval festivals and affected the youngest, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths of COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overpassed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, according to the blood donors.
69 (0.004 per cent of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in the studies carried out in China and Italy.
The largest risk of men is for those who are in their 50, and the breach between men and women is only up to 90 years.
In China, mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
They do not know the exact reasons for this gender difference, but should be a genetic and conductive factor.
The immunological differences based on gender, the less number of women smoking and the fact that men have comorbiated actors, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected persons were male and 72 per cent of COVID-19 losses were men.
In April 2020, the United States Government does not raise gender information in COVID virus infections-19.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and YAG affect men and women in a different way.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more possibilities to exposure virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of the WMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to coron, VI to virus, D to disease, and 19 to the date on which the brochure was found: 31 December 2019.
The name was elected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations to prevent estigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called a serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus and the "CVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both disease and virus.
During the initial brote in Whan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Cronavirus of Whan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the indication of 2015 to not use locations in the name of virus and diseases.
The official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as native hypotheses and parts of breathers.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed urgently the valve of a breather and the supplier could not deliver it in the requested time, a local emergency company realized inverse engineering and printed the 100 valves necessary during the night.
After the initial brochure of COVID-19, theories of conspiration, false information and desinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread by the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in skins, skins or powders.
No medicines or vaccines approved to treat disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international investigations on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "Essanyo SOLIIDARID" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing anti-virus compositions in terms of efficiency.
There is no vaccine, but several agents are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptive ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are investigated.
First, researchers try to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, is inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID virus-19.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensibilizes the immune system to some virus subunities.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this investigation focuses on the protein S that helps the virus to put into the receptive ECA2.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (ADN vacuums or ARN vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes disease. It has suggested that the improvement based on antibodies is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical studies.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malicious, including four studies on hydrochloroquin or cloroquin.
The majority of the Chinese investigations include nine tests in phase III on remdesivir in several countries and should be submitted to reports at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and possible medicines against COVID-19 was undertaken. several antiviral drugs were evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, cloroxicon and hydrochloroquina, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
A clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassive use of remdesivir.
Clinical trials in phase III were conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of poverty, was studied in China in February 2020.
Nevertheless, there are claims for pair reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of cloroquin.
However, although the Whan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of a gram, it notes that the double of that dose is very dangerous and may be letal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxichlorokine and clorocine to discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese patates also include the use of interferon, ribavirin or umphenovir against COVID-19.
Previous data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivon studies of nitazoxanida were recommended after determined that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that the initial protein S cebad that carried out the transmemberary serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the ingress of SARS-CoV-2 through the interaction with the receptive ECA2.
The studies of clorocine and hydroxichlorokine with or without azitromycine have significant limitations that prevent the medical community to adopt these treatments without more studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The liberation of cytocins may be a complication of the last stages of COVID-19 serious.
There is evidence that hydroxichlorokine may have properties that prevent the release of cytocins. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment rates after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-allerated national test in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with serious disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serial ferritine blood analysis to identify the releases of cytocin, you face these effects, which are believed as the cause of death of some infected persons.
FDA approved the antagonist of interleucine-6 receipt based on past cases for the treatment of the syndrome of cytocin release resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T-Linfocide in 2017.
To date there is no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have been collected from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the GAG with unfinished results.
Virus neutralization is the action mechanism expected by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or fagocytosis.
Other kinds of passive treatment with anticorps are developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convallency sugar, which consists of the liquid part of the patient's recovery blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased in order to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus nurses, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Whan Central Hospital, who later died by COVID-19 after generating awareness about the propagation of the virus.
