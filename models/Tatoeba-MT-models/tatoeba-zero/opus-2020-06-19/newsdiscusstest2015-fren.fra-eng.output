The remainers of UKIP who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that NHS must not serve to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this mind, he answers Yes, when the interviewer specifically asks to ask him whether people live with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First, you will use specific arguments, then discredit them by a widespread homophobia.
Each time I or my family need the NHS, we need to do the skin behind intolerants to chronic hypocontrie that thinks they're all required.
I think you are using specific arguments.
The health tourism, as defined by the right rings, does not exist practically.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would affect UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There's only in the parallel UKIP universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A torchon quote is not a evidence.
Yes, then, get on the messager.
The Mail did not write the report, it just commented it.
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be shocked to promote such a popular propaganda as if it was reality.
I don't think you know what's a specific argument.
You don't know any of my personal situations or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase has been very surprised, but only because we are talking so rare about this problem.
He did not absolutely have any homophobe comments.
You'll have to be successful to get it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come, but I think you don't like when media talk about what you don't like.
It is spoken so rare because in contrast to Pharaoh and his blind disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and inondations are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own incapacity to understand that human complexities are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also in Ireland as well as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes to the period of austerity, nothing will be arranged.
Waiting almost 5% of growth in 2015 is a great angry.
Ireland's 'TIGRE' of the EUROPE' was worth, there are some mothers.
We've known the suite!
This reiterates to read the article.
It is tried to believe that Ireland is a verbal country and that a 'Nuevau MIRACLE ECONOMIQUE' is being experienced.
With the Brussels Agreement, taxes on the lowest societys in Europe, a three-speak job walk, a continued migration.
With these ingredients not to 'pavote' for the moment with the Poland arrival.
In the 1980s of the twenty-sixth seal, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal, considering a constant permission, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was before.
Their development was not a long tranquille river, which is in view of recent events.
Is that the lower taxes in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
There is now a real hypocrisis in France from the policy on impositions actually paid by multinationals.
If there is a report issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only the PME pays full pool.
Now, I confirm that road traffic has become great, and there are new (and chair) cars, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I lived in Dublin for 14 years, it is obvious in the daily legs since the retreat.
Should it be the economic update?
Don't worry about you, I'm sure the comments will soon be frozen.
In another article that they are in writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 cutting.
Is Ryanair now counting the passengers from one to another so?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a new fleet of devices, so some boss and rays on the older ones will soon be forgotten.
That's what I want to be with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these two once struck.
So it would be completely the fault of the other pilot.
Has Ryanair paid a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without such an Irish business, you couldn't allow you to leave in holidays, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with the BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to heart joy.
Any article on Ryanair starts decades of comments of people who would never take Ryanair from those who love to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something else than the basic tariff are only taking themselves, etc.
It's enough transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs for this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and if the passengers are going to be compensated and, if so, if Ryanair will avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport controllers.
The passengers were placed in another aircraft less than one hour, they have no right to compensation.
I'm sorry to deceive you and your dreams of immunition.
Welcome to the board of this British Airway flight that brings the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good journey
Last Thursday in Paris, the street of the Francs-Buurgeois: Marais is in large part of the Peacean, and a large worldwide.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (queconques for most) or for the magazine Hall at the white-money space (hyper-intelligence and slightly poor).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the neighbor is incredibly living and animated.
With many foreigners who depend...
Do you think that the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where boats are open on Sunday, world barried with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that seems to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is disappointed by the fact that they buy in detachment.
Tourism areas lose a significant amount of business for the same reasons each year.
Returns the industry where costful equipment operated on Sunday, they allow prices to slow down.
Dominical rest is a right that benefit, except of exceptions, of employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Nor the minister of Economy, nor the other, the foreign affairs, have less competence to reform the Labour Code.
Then they're gonna cut it off.
What will the law do this?
A part of the population and enterprises that want to work on Sunday is satisfied.
To Montreal Sunday, I take my little kids to the municipal library.
In my Ville of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is opened for 4 days per week but not for us!
That's the access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of time of work.

Churchill wasn't perfect.
I'm not anymore.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 He held his head to the other government aristories who wanted to discuss a “concord” with the nazis and gained very much.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he has joined the country in the idea to fight fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, finally, all the world, can thank God for having had been during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
The largest Churchill has nothing to see with this debate.
That its descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money of successive fees, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
That's so simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can reverse only when it was “the moment of truth” the personality of Churchill was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A renewal of the internal market by public works will only promote major companies that will increase their dividends by avoiding employer, infrastructure chainers will be lowly renewable.
As regards the social reforms made by the Minister, they well reflect the actual franchise evil: the infidelity towards the dialogue
Back to princess values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
That the weakest of us is not in the need!
If we are in solidarity with his help, he has DROIT in exchange of services that he provides or made a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.

The small genius of the Finance is uniquely missing imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of deficiency in major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are exceededed.
The need for infrastructure is, therefore, marginal, a new deal could be a solution.
About a time when the question of decrease emerges in response to a recession that is only a brutal decrease
You would have raisoned 30 years ago: more (or opportunities) of barges, carbon mines, authors...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock, then the need for investment is creating: isolation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A tax that promotes high income and residents.
Who's the power?
It was obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung benefits are made bad by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
A half-seventh introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seized buyers who wouldn't have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones, and I decided for the G3 LG.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not with Apple's benefit.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft established this philosophy, we knew a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and can't be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their sub-jacent philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not accompany no value to design, for them options, functionality and price.
There's nothing bad about this.
Stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different but likely.
I would like to see a forest portable industry with radically different approaches to people and markets.
It's more healthy and must be encouraged.
This is our interest in all.
I am glad you have found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even if I did a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our opposite friends who, according to one of them, fight the ideas and not the men (who, though, on parisian balls), could tell us about the authors who are struggling the ideas of the kind and show us the books they are just listening to fighting.
Or do they attack just like Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemour?
Well, Jean, I love you well, and you're someone intellectual and culted.
I told this about Judith in Furusato's vineyard, who called Holopherne, who wasn't coming to me (I didn't have his life of mind).
Otherwise, in the "fund" because you return it, this issue does not interest me, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I hope that you and your friends could get me out of my ride, because I'm late but I understand well...
@John: Recognize that, culturally, Judith returns to Holopherne.
Who feared the world?
But what are we afraid those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answer elements.
The first by calling the Bible Judith, the second as the qualified Judith Butler of very symbolic gorge.
We see how close these studies touch their homes.
Of course we are no longer in the debate of the idea.
It's another thing, well deep.
Have you read, Jean, what the World has published a article on the need of the theology?
@: As regards a discussion of idea, I thought he had to go to sources.
To fight ideas from the only exhibition that they do with their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, the inventor of Genre or X Lacroix, theocratic) does not seem very strict.
But good, as I explained to our hump-frontist friend, it's the whole difference between having a clear view and a simple view.
I'm not on the other hand that he's understood the nuance.
I haven't read Judith, the very symbolic grace, I was satisfied with the "Third sex" (that was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's words.
While I looked at the elipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was clearly shown when the clouds were opened.
This sudain appearance of the red moon had its charm and a little deceptive of having sometimes been blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the noise of last night would really enter the Coast of Victoria and NSW, while the largest part of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the laboratory responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its real color as far as possible.
You're obsessed, right?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne also succeeded in covering the whole week of the Persesian meteor rain and for almost all the important astronomical phenomenon of the past few years.
I start thinking that there's a bad genius whose only goal is to prevent Melbourne's people to see what is from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for a observer, even though things greatly improved on the other side of the Cordiller.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the elipsis because of clouds above the Melbourne bathroom.
I'll put a TAXE on this elipse.
CHINQUE looks at this elipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thinking of the day is for Abbott, as last before you sleep.
Who or what will obsess you when he will (forwardly) end by disappearing?
It seems that you have a lot of time to read the discussions searching for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government to then accuse them to be obtained by the EUX.
Super photos of Monday above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It seems that Mars's gonna go into collision with the Earth!
Nothing on the barrier and real estate showing.
No inequality between work and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.

Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too or not.
The details and arguments of these preconceptions are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents to make a view.
Let's see today Tuesday 15 October the results of wonderful revenues: in Spain, exports are at least lower than five years.
In Greece, the swimming swimming down.
However, it seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notes would generate a request for unimmunization of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these applications are not based.
Is there a mistake in the Ministry of Economy?
Should the decision-makers have the political benefit resulting in the courageous attack of notes have the same courage when presenting the facture to the State budget?
The next in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
@lol Non's State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporary horizon of the State is theoretically infinitely unfinished while the household is borrowed by the life period of its members.
In addition, less than considering that public expenditure is inproductive, these contribute to financing material and implantal investments from tomorrow's growth and therefore in future revenues.
Some elements of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the holy grain of Hippocrate: the health of profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved before all.
Nice theory of the complex.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasm.
Medical personnel would like to serve it, but they have hands related to the law as written by policies.
It's the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortements instead of having risked surgery interventions, the shooting rooms for drugs rather than have them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to be satisfied with the inculted mass.
In fact, doctors do not win money with medicines.
That's why there are pharmaciens.
physicians do not win money with medicines Since the Liberals want that our health system is like the United States, you should learn about how this works.
Among the world, doctors are shortened in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been bad to put the tube, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of enterprises and the “search”.
So read a few rare reports about our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the worldly prices of medicines present throughout the world, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is in sale or only on order.
This strengthening is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific, direct or indirect process.
In fact, some enterprises are at the time testing on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that strive them and the necessary permissions.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who are reaching a version of good quality products to known doses will be widely benefited.
I'm sorry to tell you madam, but you're wrong, it's going to be a lot of things in the collisions for doctors and pharmaceuticals.
As regards this hospital, they were pleased to serve it until someone puts the pocket to the ear of a hospital responsible.
We can't have patents on herb...
If the "searchers" in social sciences were research instead of policy and networking, their "works" could be used.
A investigator, he does not compare a fact to another.
Compare it is not searching.
Compare it's doing pedagogy not searching.
You can't say "search is out there is to apply" and then in the same jet, "we need to experiment to everything."
If your investigations are overcome, why are you experiencing?
If your investigations aren't cut off, why ask you to apply them?
Can you explain how a "forscher" can deduce that a student who does not like the single mathematics could easily easier the mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow to learn the condition that students learn to serve new technologies but how would they get to learn the new technologies if they don't know?
Pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfied with us.
What will this be to build a indicator that informs you of what you are arranging, an auto-promoting will, a falseness?
One piece to form teachers: electing the sophists and ideologists from training, and the practitioners teach practicians.
Fabric refers to the paragraph on the stages (which is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion puts us to the most inefficient conservatism: "This is a device that leads mostly to the reproduction of the practices in force, which does not allow to progress the system."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, only practitioners do not want to teach practitioners, even though they have all their place in a modern education of teachers.
Theoryans of education should not have any place.
The practitioners, they must have one.
Should you be operated by a surgery whose training is totally theoretical, and who has never put the feet into an early operational block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system.
Giving more weight to educational theoryers, it would finally destroy it.
Your analogy is totally horrible: if I wouldn't like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like to do less by a surgery who has no theoretical training and has learned on the tas.
Mike Weatherley, the conservator for the fight against the violation of the law of author by David Cameron
Why don't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thanks.
If one day I begin to feel guilty to violate the right of author, it would be enough to read a article like that.
In an information economy, the violation of the law of author = flight.
That's the same because they need to quote their sources correctly.
Remember, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of the author's right.
Not all the same thing.
Using content without having the appropriate license, you free the artists of their wine.
You can always discuss the pedestrian hypothesis - but it's flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it will not become so true.
It is a violation of the author's right.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating the author's right
Visiblely this does not trie to save the artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school responsibilities, almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to save them from this fixed income.
Learning No. 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they leave any intellectual property to the site in accordance with the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 ballet with a girlfriend in the school bus, they should be expulsed to have the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we control, the rail that says that everything's going bad....
If it's a PS deputy, we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they're age to choose, I'd suggest them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France shoots people down by continuously assisting them.
I don't want my children to support the debt that this policy will be established.
What takes France down, it's talks like yours.
@gus I'm working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in enterprises leading by excellent business leaders: it exists in France, but it's rare.
I'm employed because I know that I don't have the ability to lead a company and that choice allows me to shoot red balls on the nucleus patterns I'm frequently meeting.
In my baskets I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if it is compared to German companies that French leaders are constantly quoted to request reforms in France, Germany has structured their industrial tissue to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large business and small and medium-What are French patrons expecting to do so?
What's the state holding their hands?
This state they accused of imperiality?
@Jacques L.
Always this counterparty of your business leaders!
Remember, what have you created as a job, as a value added, to be too severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an unsolvable problem: the incompetence of the chiefs of French undertakings to create jobs and which spends and threatens by waiting for the permanent State assistant!
That's horrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, patronal charges, taxes, work at 45 hours/week payed 35, and some, walking on eggs, or claiming the decline of salary without their removal!
I am glad to see all the “negativ” comments on this subject.
What is irone to see how people are always struggling from First Group.
As I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us.
They tried to keep on fleet instead of transforming themselves.
That doesn't mean that the eco-scale paths have not been improved since Last is on it.
But they were also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
We're unfortunately not the power to do this, hey.
I tried to have recently tried, but I did not.
But well, the work will shoot us, isn't it...
It's a international branch.
They already worked trains in Germany.
No one prevents people in the United Kingdom to create more moral and participate in offering.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our private services are finished by being managed by a foreign operator.
I remember the scandale and critics when First has returned the Virgin contract, all of this is to be finally cancelled.
And it's better that MTR, a Hong Kong company, reported Crossrail's operating contract for eight years.
Well, as they repeated us during the referendum campaign, it is totally for common and shared workers and think that all workers must be married beyond the borders.
It may therefore be expected that they will be pleased with this decision ;)
It may be because the management of the Netherlands is on good rails while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owners but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the struggle system of franchis, not the franchistor.
"It was a battleing girl."
God, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
It is likely that the fact of being "beat" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, the understanding, the listening, for example, the fact of being "batter" has nothing to see with the one to survive to a disease: "beaters" cancers that are not less dead, I know palancers.
Doing a disease has nothing to see with merit.
Let's start again.
I don't tell you that it's LA condition to generate, I tell you that it's IADE..
There's nothing to see with some mercy...
When your life's examples, there's only one to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Instructing, wouldn't just a moment, that we may have a merit to get out of a disease or that we can't get out of it, it's just a monster.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lacks, however, despite the will, despite the confidence in the doctor, you have a vague idea of what C?
Instead of thinking the contrary, if, uncertainly, having a solid moral allows to accept easier treatment and to prepare it, to try experimental treatments like this woman, and not to reject them by fear.
Someone who's struggling in a physician is first one who trusts the doctor.
But if we prefer to get it to the "Master" is another thing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
These considerations are own to moralists.
When you touch a salt, a real one, you're going to make it shock so that you're just a zombie.
Personally, I touched two, saltities, bigs, and if I'm "beat" as these psychological purposes say, it's completely missing.
Unless this struggle is only to shut the dents, to suffer the hell and to cast the cuts.
I thought the accused of Milosevic was decided and ended for a decade of years.
I haven't seen that name in newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
An forgotten birthday.
His proceedings were undergoing rapidly and then balled under the mass.
Is it the story we told at the time?
The Communist became nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans during the last decade?
The Communist President of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please ask, therefore, what has been left voluntaryly: 1.
How could NATO bombs be legal in accordance with international law rules?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valuable target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a trailer.
And if he defended him, he would be inflicted by the Western Compressor.
Western smoke screens used to detach a part of a sovereign State which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was presumably recognised by the Western States, who then lie on the ground situation.
The Serbian population is now totally disappeared (ethnic purification).
Vojislav Kostuni, who is mentioned here, was politically dead after his first mandate so that he did not understand the situation developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures of the time's political world.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of Tyran (if we did not like it).
I know that only in Greece a method of prediction of seeds walks nearly, measureing the piézoelectric level in the quarter.
This kind of study is inconsistently useful and thanks to share the results.
A hope, however, is to put this water has nothing to see with the named HAT-P-11b explanet, situated around 124 years of light of the Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and freest planet to present detect water molecules", according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming team and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
The method to follow.
Like those who involve animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thank you for the Scientist's Passer of bringing us often of these experimental weapons that are done in the world.
How would the animals be (In advance)?
Uncertainly, the perception of other elements of which the rate evolves in the case of seismo.
Like radon, for example.
A gas was inodore for man but may be deceptive by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for humans, but not for the measuring instruments it is available.
Or we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been mainly observed (and since centuries) that some animals act in strange way with a seismo, including powders, vaches, dogs, but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen a art report that tells about the struggle of two scientific teams, one of California, the other Japanese, to recognise the validity of their work that leaded to the sensibility of animals to the earthly magnetic fields, and especially to their changes before a seed.
So I'm not scientist but their hypothesis had convinced me!
Or are we on these investigations?
Why isn't it so bad toward this track?
We should learn again to listen to the nature...
If we consider things calmly and strictly, it is published in a serious magazine, and no one is missing it.
Since we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we'll be heated at the same bial: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seed the red fish turned out awkwardly around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservators.
He's done too much as a master of London.
When we listen to the LBC program, we can't stop thinking that this man does not know anything and is always trying to divorce with a blue.
He never answers anywhere directly.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't call one point.
He made so many promises to be elected as a master and has not held it alone.
It's just emphasising how the rest of the Conservator Party is only a massage, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
It was in "Have I Got News for you".
Because it's a celebration, and people were inculked to worship celebrates.
The Londonians voted for him and will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity count of the Tories will grow the platform I'm sure.
God helps us.
I am not so sure that people love the blagues, but do not want their first ministers to be one.
That's exactly what the Londonians said.
He would have brought his friend the parking with him, more intelligent than him.
In terms, I think he's trying to cope R Branson.
The Americans had one as a President.
The Frenchs have really seen and always declined in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been given the punishment of reading a few books (which exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Satan" and the "detroit of ice" speak, so unfortunately that the dead who have remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their slow crews, Australia, must always be through the fund since the Savo battle) did not want to return to it.
We actually pass before the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission touchs its end.
That's the little ones.
But the echo coat is a total smoke.

Welcome I think the red that has demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this journey is sponsorized by the British Region and the Brest Villa.
More seriously, it seems to me that local collectives and public organizations in any way should not devote one of our taxes to finance the dreams of some even sympathetic adventurers!
Is there players in the current Serbia training that is cosovary origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at the Youth and now in Fenerbahuja, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
It's Bisevac Lyon's Defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a terrain environment or before in the 1970s and 80s, and has been incoming many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is of Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a attack in the large team of Velez, which, under the board of the Legendary Suleman Rebac, twice ended in the second place in the Yugoslavian link (and also accounted on points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful Equipment of Arsenène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thanks Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said he was going to become a big player when he was at the Juve, he is now in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen, he was linked to 2016 *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener, and I know there's no title.
Maybe it's still doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Very seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't worry.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the drapeau of this drone is not the dragon of the true Albania today.
It seems to be the dragon of the Great Albania, which includes all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Unfortunately, there was no too many degates (who I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian dragon with the map not what the Great Albania was called, but from Albania before 1913, when the European powers decided to give boards from the country to the neighbouring countries.
How can we feel "a pleasant explosion" by seeing two tours get out of knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What makes me a little at this "share" is that the only fact that I could, would only once, be spontaneously joyed of the horrible death of thousands of people, witnesses at my eyes of a "border line" personality with all" witnesses should be taken with the greatest circumstance.
Uncertainly, in the short moment of "joy," there will be no thought about the dead or the reality of the inflicted horrible.
It would be just thinking, a moment, that, for a time, Muslims have been able to really do and apocalypically hurt the great wicked Satan in his heart.
To make qqch powerful.
The great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims ruined by their feelings of humbleness.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Fair Freude.
We had a little bit of it.
The Western "Christian/blanc/gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, angry, hatred of the muslim when he contempt the general poverty, the sub-social and cultural development of the Arab Arab world today.
I'm talking about Caire or Alger faubourgs, not Dubai tours.
The past splender, certainly magnified, is not a console, on the other hand.
How does the Muslim world out of this diabolic throne?
Totally in the phase, 2 major fishes are irrigating the Arab world: the large conservatism of the established powers and the fascising nihilism.
The common point, the glass of thought and excommunication (douce or armed) of his critical expression.
What have been understood before, you should not make the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I think that's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the automne marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and the humidity of many people.
Moreover, everyone gets sick.
A seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes, it's the hell for me and those like me.
A vitamin D dose should help a little for humor and well-being.
The car is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign is in particular to cut the suffix in autom.
Not as to cut the souffle as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the summer becomes a weekend.
We've been a nice one this year, don't make your grins that rounds the clowns!
Not everyone.
I'm randomly sick in winter.
But now I'm at the retreat and I don't develop immunity for outside germes, it can change, I think.
It's not being on the point of death, it's just a stage in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of swimming owls, with a febrility that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of eternity and full of other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
This is my recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months make me actually more happy and more detained.
For the fiscalization of majorities for children , it is the amount covered by the State which provides mainly from the decimals 8 to 10 .
However , in terms of the number of households that have seen their tax to increase from this measure , these are especially the numbers 4 and 5 concerned ( median income) according to graph 2 .
The elimination of the half part in particular of the widows is not all treated in the article or instead of its impact is completely assessed: EUR 230 m is a shocking that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013, and understood that it is indolent.
And it's not ready to stop.
Well, we're not on the ball, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a policy instead of left we're not going to smile...
It is obvious that those who are part of 20% the richest must support much more than 75% of tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue in this way and you will encourage these 20% to less work or from.
Well, I know, that's not politically correct, but I'm telling it at once.
Live the Trots and the OCI recycted to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you're seeing badly what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same here or in the Bahrein: 20% of the population have 80% of the riches.
Equitable taxes, it's when he forbids anyone to love as much as he can.
Out of a certain limit the money lost its entire use.
And once over the use of money, the money will be more than to do money, i.e. ) to make the worse of the largest number.
It is 20% of the richest.
Indeed also 20% of households who work most (and create riches with a part logically redistributed).
Equitable tax must allow these homes to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or then, as much as low arms and live at least social, especially if there is a social housing.
The utopies of red khmer head cuts have lived.
I made two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have experienced in a 5-star hotel and we have not had to present us at receipt or face a fewer tracks.
It's enough to go home somebody, to sleep there, to spend behind himself and to share.
Dorenavant this will be my first option when I'm on travel.
The logo changed, people...
Check your assurance before loving your house.
In most cases, you will need a type of owner insurance.
Please use a service with the good logo!
Oh, it's too late 6 hours.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and high-risk" It's not true.
You just missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
In his download, the response of Airbnb to Teman was almost fast, almost fast.
At 24 hours, after a email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a lock to change the locks, took provisions for a week to pass to the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is assured, but at times).
So why is this article quoted by the Teman that has not received support from Airbnb?
I'm AIRBNB, to receive how to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used bnb air just to make me back.
I think to pay a shop and a month to lodge from a shop but I'm afraid to send 1 600 £ to a site that I have never really heard.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops” crying the Bu$here on all the tons...
So weapons are inoffensive.
I'm sure that this will enjoy family and nearly thousands of dead curves in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succeeded otherwise than the chemical saddam Hussein bombs.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inadequate (to stay poli).
Moreover, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons found nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not clear the style of the author: "to search for weapons of massive destruction.
We're okay.
You think it's the time to fail the army to strengthen education.
It is never time to strengthen education, because we are always in war.
Alternative: Is it time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
There would already be a lot of education if it would work 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At the time, our teachers now gain more than technicians.
And it is not possible to believe that teachers are about 18 hours a week to prepare their program.
But this does not seem, since National Education does not have the way to provide a office to the college/learned to his teachers so they're in their home.
A sort of forced telephone, except that the employer does not pay the computer, nor the Internet connection, nor supplies.
Furthermore, it's so much the floor at 17 hours per week and 4 months of vacation that we're not coming to fill the math CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How do you don't want to smell you with ill-educated smells that parents fear you over by treating blonder?
I think that the priority in this area is to defeat the djihadites so that the Khurde population could better expand.
Where you see that Bush administration has completely done everything through.
My first job was in the sale, in London, to win nothing three times, but it was a post for which it needed a diploma.
A year later, I saw an advertising to be opened for London's metro, it was paid $5,000 per year and not even asked the patent.
I never regretted.
In this regard, don't make you feel if you don't find a diplomated job, try to find anything that pays well or you like to do.
If I was stayed in diplomatic jobs, I would still pay my student loan.
I don't like the business work so much, so I hope to pass in the public or in the university world at a time.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my diploma in 2011, there was a three-year-old fall.
The best way to reduce the number of non-employed diplomas?
Exhibition of biwnor filiers such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy/political sciences, which is called the unemployment diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas, and I've finished the production director.
He noted that the importance was not the diploma, but, as the above article states, a good professional course, starting at school and all over the university.
Indeed, the department wage was less but it is rapidly shocked because in the real world the results are more than knowledge.
This discussion of engineering/artist subsidies has been dealt with for years.
Scientists cannot resolve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up the morning, to get work at time and to interact with people in a way to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are biwnor filiers?
It's ridiculous.
I think you're talking about general media study diplomas or whatever the subsidiarity is absent where you're gone.
Letters, philosophy, political and art sciences are true branches.
We need people who can explain the major questions to the license, including the importance of cultural basiss such as literature, art, etc., and put them into value.
This would not be better a real territorial policy to desecure Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I see the people of the end-fund of the Eunne and the Val-d'Ocean to go over 80 km every day in the vel to work to Paris.
Intra-more and small ceilings have already many more practical means of transport (metre, bus, tramway).
> several safe and closed parks, as there are already in the northern Europe cities in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the beach.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2RM.
Indeed, it is hoped that the Paris Ville works with the Netherlands and Denmark professionals.
As well as benefiting from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found place for UN SEUL switching device.
The motivation seems to be stronger when it is to find a office for Bertrand Delanoe....
Well, it's not all right.
When it is discussed with pietons and other users of the common transport of the reasons for which they do not spend it seems to me that the main reasons that are resurrected are: 1/ It is dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these shooters that run over fast and fail to survive 2/ are taken full pollution in the head For me cyclable pistes are swimming pools, it must be reducing the car loading (storm loading loading) speed (Paris = 30), to respect the road code in sysmmetric switching (seen swimming swallows need to adapt the switch code for the switch to the 100 years of shoot).
Cyclable pistes are of the apartment, we must cohabit but reequilibrate the occupation of the urban space.
There's nothing on the ship in the Great Paris?
Doesn't a word on the ship place in common transportation?
EELV is right.
The 15% target of speed movement is ridicule.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the green in the fat.
In addition to seeing what OR reports, EELV adjoints seem sceptic.
I prefer very optimistic.
Before the racket doesn't start, it'll be better to find who really hidden behind this mask.
Index: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial activity.
A lawyer expressed his intention to put the case before the CEDH, but I have not heard that a complaint has been effectively issued.
Furthermore, they should first be complained in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases are discarded by waiting for the result of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that it would take.
Yeah, but Libya did not explose Pan Am 103 more.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, in this case the Ukrainian government is responsible for airspace security.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircrafts had been attacked previously, Ukraine was launched in the aircraft area against rebels, and all aircraft could certainly be considered possible and immediately.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has he chosen to play with the life of innocents so that airlines pay the rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their U.S. Government / the Ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - who want to demonstrate that Poutine attacked the MH17 flight.
As I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what happens in their heavens.
The previous: An arrest of 1986 from the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebellious conflict forces to Nicaragua did not mean that the United States were responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia leave this case to the CCI.
It's fun to think Abbott wants to mean Poutine that Australians were killed by Russian rebellies.
I hope that it can present evidence to slow up his allegations.
Until the investigators haven't said anything like this.
Call Ricardo and be such a beoten in Eco, it's affecting!
Call Polyar is losing the north is happy.
A single question of Beoten: is the poor today more poor than the poor inheritance?
I can't stop noting that those who most virgulously criticize the Piketty book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production revenues, capital income, inequality-concentration, labour inequality, capital property, merit and heritage in the term log.
He shows that the concentration of the capital today joins the beginning of 20th to 1914, showing that it is the two world wars that have declined the capital concentration, from 1914 to 1945, and how the concentration returns after...
Bernajuzan: You don't do anything.
I ask you how long this took you to read this pavilion knows that the concentration capacity of a person has a few limits.
Then the question is not to know whether it is easy to read.
The question is if the summary of the central thesis given by the press is just or not.
If it is fair, it is possible to discuss about that without having read the book which is essentially to argue in a single sense for that.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading?
Is the central thesis of his pave summarised by the press is false?
I didn't read and I won't read it.
I therefore trust in the summary of his central thesis and that's the one that seems to be pure fuming.
The concept of difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is humanity not globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to the increased population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and worth the price without doubt.
But remember that she's just 17 years old.
A age in which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a fade for the young girl and she will find her way to carry a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western Governments who want to prove the old adjustment that the colored perverse is the incarnation of the evil.
All my happiness vows in Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educe girls in Pakistan or even in the popular districts of Great Britain!
Someone thought his talk was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but said that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married for 14 years.
Is Malala itself not part of these "colored perverse"?
You shouldn't have no "time" on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible perverse.
It's absolutely revolving.
No, his father wouldn't marry her for 14 years.
She was 15 years old when we shot him up.
His father is leading to a school where girls are schooled, and it is in favour of women ' s equality.
It is, and has always been, so that it receives a higher education and that it has the right to decide it itself from her marriage.
For this reason, it's someone who lives in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that a medium-sized Pakistanian girl should often marry at 14 years without having her word to say.
I'm sorry that she didn't have sufficely loose for you.
This may seem contradicting, but maybe she wants to say that if his father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married for 14 years.
Shortly deceived by this 4-th stage entry, and especially by Jessica Lange, which apparently has a bit bad to find her personality of Marlene Dietrich.
I came to look at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horrible series, one of the most worthy!
A first fascinating episode.
The achievement is near to the perfection and the show of Jessica Lange sing the Life on Mars de Bowie is simplely reversing.
I have not yet seen this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have a shock that looks at 13 episodes stolen on 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, outside Jessica Lange, is especially the risks of scenes and mountains that sit down.
In AHS there is an abalanche of original plans that do not ridiculize the assetting of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you put the shooting in advance for the next seasons without even waiting for the power to shoot the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pilar of this series, but, you say so well, there are still other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially his way and how she uses it) is really the UN pillars of the series outside technical quality.
And I'm looking at a lot for her.
Then I find that the series of sins by writing, she wants to do too much in the same time.
The season 3 was slightly below, in 2 was too dispersed, despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 stations of American Horror Story or this will end as a 24-hour chronic.
But everybody does what he wants!
That's why I say "I will not look later" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, JE thinks she's gonna be fatale.
But after that, it's just my opinion.
Let us speak less tax shoes, please, instead, in the State expenditure.
No, let's increase expenditure, please.
Those who wanted to know in expenditure failed.
Starting pollecs about relatively few expenditure posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the error margin in Government expenditures in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all in talking to noise instead of the orientation change that the elections seem to call their vows and for all that time, in each camp, they seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the electioners are clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Above 1 % of expenditure.
The 'debt' is an asset detained primarily by financial institutions in this country.
The debt is nothing that doesn't worry.
I wouldn't see any problem that the Government applies to a third of my income (or even before I talked about consumption taxes) if I thought he would be aware of it.
But that's not the case, and many contributions have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not actually been honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, high speed 2, the subsidies to eolians nearly unnecessary and the nuclear centers that cost the duplication of what they should do, you will arrive to a number that seems to redistribute the work and the Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residues.
Your first 10 000 £ are not impossible.
This means that someone who wins 35,000 £ per year will pay about 50,000 £ (a seventh of their salary), one with 50 000 £ would pay around 10,000 £ (a fifth), and one with 200,000 £ pays about 70,000 £ (one more than a third).
What about social contributions?
More social rates, more local taxes, more station costs and car wine, and it is before TVA.
About 30% of my money is preleved to the source before local taxes and the car rental.
I'm decently paid, but not extravagant.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But we do not seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where there are billions of tax books.
How can a labour looking for work at the port of the door prove it?
While even 20% of the unemployed people do not look for, it means that 80% are searching and not found.
Has I even unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
What a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, this increases my chances.
Indeed, I haven't had any news from Pole Employees for months, which means that agents are more busy for control operations than to really make job advertisements?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not the state of providing work.
If Pole Employee does not provide enough posts, then it is necessary to pass from Polish Employee.
What is a sensible subject?
We all have rights and debts, in the event, we are assured that the unemployers have a good fulfilment of their duties in contradiction to their rights.
As a supervisor requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a service manager or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody crys the scandale in these cases, right?
It is effectively good to remember that unemployers have rights: the only two times when I had undertaken Pole Employee, my rights to the EEA had been wrongly established, and on one of the dossiers, 40% shocked, it had failed to fight closely.
It takes time!
I'm not a expert right.
Fixing and control is currently above, while stately Pole Employee is near to be an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of decommunization should not refer only to employees, these are those who pay the costs.
Non-France policies and non-salariated rights are granted to them not in fact!
It's not normal.
I would add that a dignity of unemployment involves the value of the employed work.
More than waiting for twins in Arab...
In fact, a direct military reply in Iraq/Syria is to stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then be like the propagation of black pest in 1348/9 in connection with war and population movements at the time.
The Saudians had the spirit of prohibiting Hadj this year in Mexico to the Muslim Pelers from the three touched countries.
The Party reports that 7 400 have seen their request of visa rejected because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a penner coming from Bosnie who contracted the variation in Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably polluted by a peer coming from Somalia, where disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will be the same spirit presence.
Does it be in heart to propose to prevent Ebola's diseases to take a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just a good sense, but apparently those "who knows" decided that we could risk the life of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries, where Ebola is outside control, should be placed in a strict quarter.
Nobody's out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treatment of patients before they could go.
If they're contracting Ebola virus while they're there, they're staying there until they're healed.
There are no dramatic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having contact with West African people, although they had “all the necessary warnings.”
We can stop the advancement of this disease.
It is mainly promoting by airlines.
We prohibit them to fly to these countries.
In addition, Customs agents should be formed to report to people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that those may be immediately miscept in quarentaine.
What happens to pass the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) second and will mercy the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt that it is able to adhere in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this design there.
This only makes 20 years that information appears to be as the first given humanity, while the religion, the brain issue, may lead to our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of become a major protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize no way put the feet to the church, there is only a low number of protesters in France.
What is the next step, is the concept of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: I'm sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, it may allow to touch more worlds...
@MartineE, to be honest (for example) the respect of others like you were expected to be Christian.
Hellel said a century ago, "Do not do any others what you don't want to do to do to you, it's the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!".
Christianity is well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduced the appagy.
Do you "progress justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Nearly step: incarnation and resurrection are taken.
Jesus will remain this hero who boiling the moral laws by redetermining the respect of others.
The Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our society and make progress on justice, peace, brotherhood.
Isn't it very catholic?
I remember that the low number of protesters in France is mainly explained by the fact that their former ones have been exterminated, then they have become forced and struck to immigration some centuries ago.
I'm too hot between buying this, the new Alien game, or Watteland 2.
And the new Elite game is soon out.
That doesn't make it.
I would personally choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fund leverage campaign) but I don't think that's 30 £.
If this is the PC version you interest, Green Man Gaming currently sell SoM to 30 pounds and also propose a good reduction of 20 %.
Green Man Gaming currently sell SoM at 30 £ and also proposes a 20% reduction.
I'm gonna look at it.
Of course not at work.
The joy rabats of the IT department block all the sympa sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ then 20% decrease, or do 30 £ include 20 % of reduction?
However, warning: PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no payment, isn't it.
It's time to buy a new video card * Make the goul*
This is a Brazilian website, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ per PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they're expansive of your library if they decide to strive against the people who buy it there when they're out of the planned region.
So join the beta version of Elite : Dangerous.
So, in 1940, was France a "threat earth"?
So say that Nobel price seemed to me all of a sweet gift.
Should you love France of 40, "the strange of the strange"?
When you see here obtain the literature Nobel are asked whether Proust or Dostoyevsky had it today.
Nobel isn't even an event, it is not even intended to read the early authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Midiano, who is already difficultly liable in French, and who describes a very limited and selfish universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but I'm clearly sure.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a close relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel price?
That'd be better to judge.
As to China, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate M.
Modiano to his just value, if they don't know him already!
From your side, continue to have Levy and Musso frequencies.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who has obtained the literature Nobel: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, ladies.
Since I drived it in Island, I don't stop see Kia Sporting all over.
I think this thing followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to kick me?
Or do you get me out like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, are you still hate?
Hello DQ - No, not today, I took my medocs.
That's merry!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend, I went to the Bird Festival of Nottingham.
It was random.
I successfully trigger 19 different birds, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixing of people there, there was not only CAMRA's fanatics (which did not confront the fans of the camera).
It was really hard to drive on the back of the Sunday.
Thursday night we went to the grandfather of a puzzle to play the nine brag card.
Thanks to a real chance of starting I could share with several decents.
I hope if I get to 95 years old, I'll be as living as he.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar to Farringdon.
One of my drinks has arrived with a shirt upstairs.
I'm admire M.
Read a little Buuddha and you will understand how wrong you do, dear Christian.
This says, without wanting to contrary you, I think you're a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, she bans the demands for the Djihádites to the outdoor of the mosques.
She reports the weapon traffic without late.
We have the large eyes open as Meddeb and Tayya or Boubaker, or we have the big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not watching the closed eyes that we can access to light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but again, you do a monumental contrast: the totality of representative, Muslim or not authorities or organizations, who have formally condemned the II and its crimes, French, Islamic or not, have nothing to add to these unified official convictions.
That's not the word that it allows.
The problem is that people like you first see them as musulmans, Arabs or Africans.
Not as French.
Unfortunately, nice Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said thousand times, some doubt about the approval by the Jews of the Jewish Maskers in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent of accusing them with priority and demanding publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that she had wrongly doubt.
This principle is at my eyes the rejection of the Republic and can only contribute to deliving the French society.
SI there's no doubt, as well as say.
Who does not agree, but what do they agree?
Consents to a proximity with II or EI condemnation.
The silence is well practiced, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the head and the shooting.
Your position is intellectally honest and pragmaticly intentable.
Alex Salmond predicted that, during elections, the Scotia could "wear" of the parties represented in Westminster because a huge shock was crossed between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised to the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be paid to the idea to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron's got to ride.
What are these threats?
Conservers are completely wrong with Scotia because they have no seat.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think that even Cameron is enough stupid to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservers.
Who will smile a laugh for the Travailist Party.
They will completely eliminate SNP and UKIP in Scotia, which will cut their head in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the ProMESSE, thinking that he knew his party but without taking into account that he signed the death stop of his Scozian deputy.
It is not surprised that some labour deputy demands accounts to their leader.
If the SNP won 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats do not come to Conservers, they will then be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservers and Workers to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think this is instead the important thing.
Not if the Labour or Conservators want to be re-elected one day in England.
Decreasing pomps of 8 per cent to 85 per cent, it is not a super-electoral strategy.
Furthermore, when the eco-scale deputy will no longer vote on the issues related to England, the Conservators will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's right.
Cameron may not have a lot to lose, but Miliband yes.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it was successful to him.
However, he is still in license to be the first minister in 2015 and since he returned the Travailist Party's headquarters.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his floor and see what he read, how he is reading, and up to the mouth.
It's "The Life of Others" of East Germany or KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the end, it will at least have a sterdy effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon Manufacture VOTRE book on VOTRE Profile and this is automatically thanks to a secret algorithm!
It's like a world.
Fortunately stimulates.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, it remains reading of pirated files, public domain books or buyed by some editors who have the ability to propose files without mouchard.
Since the price I paid the Kobo, it's unfortunately.
I am excited of the generalized agency of users faced the generalized appreciation of their private life.
In your large public library you will be fully observed that everyone gives his fidelity card (fn*c, d*itre, ...).
There are also demanding leaders whose opening and completion rates are certainly detrimental.
For example, James Joseph’s “Fnegans Wake”.
@Thomas: In Big Data's era, the data really does not need to be personal to be relevant.
Not put the whole literature into the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The collection is not an anonymous.
This is the data published by Kobo, which are not allowed to identify readers, nor the authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exagerated, misleading and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be conducted by a full-sized maternal class of cysophrane children under oxygen.
It is even worse than that if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
It is interesting that some parties in Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not my. ;-)
Very well seen :-P But Turkey does not want to shoot a ball on his feet, unless it won something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will rise, so it's actually shooting a ball in the feet.
A diploma at the retreat wrote on his blog: "The AP reported that Iran has guarded the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad because this would cause Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent there a serious warning of resurrection or if it would simply advise the prudence.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprised is that today the Iraqi and American diplomatic commitment to Syria, Israel and the security of the region is now.”
The read of India Punchline is to recommend strongly that anyone takes attention to the details rather than the traditional media c*nneries. The short article you give is important and should be read in mind by observing the real remarks/advertisements previous from Iran in terms of Afganistan around 1979 to 1980.
Who are those “modified” who seriously fight the horrible Lay Assad, and in the same time the ISIS' wicked ones?
The pipelin policy slows the world to the aime, and I would suggest those who are referring to "modified" inexperienced to give more attention to facts and alternatives before sending children to the third World War.
“It's still worse than if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan” Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
There would be a prosecution of Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide made by the Turkishs.
Should he “deal ”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals, nor the victims, have no less chance of being in life?
A little later for that, my...
Should the criminals haven't been ill now, gender 120 years old?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly on the triumphate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talate and Djemal killed just after the 1st World War by the Armenians, and Envertied by the slaughterers in a small nearby Central Asian place when it was left to establish a Turkish imperial.
That's funny!
A impressive mastery of the fatal pint sophism, but on the other hand, we're just looking for contact with the real.
It's a crowd without argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart that even struggle in the wheel of a portable mother.
Lebanese couples may just be a child's desire and not an attempt to be accepted.
The stereal hester couples are also.
How much kids!
It's a shame to appoint them as a future psychological unbalance.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, saying that they are happy to live, win their life and pay the retreat of this lady (?)
The GPA is certainly a provisional "solution" in the development of the doctor who knew our world.
She doesn't give it today.
Many women took and put into the world children who weren't their husbands.
It's still so, we're doing so...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is covered so that the "marking" of the body is limited.
But ethical surgery, cosmetics are not also marketing body?!
Analogue Faunity...
It is certainly easier to grow a good in far-related countries via Internet and Pay Pal than to send his responsibilities and to avoid the scandale in another century near home without crying it at this time on all the teeths! ...
These practices were no longer made in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who reject these practices ...
There is no less than the exploitation of the body is a real problem.
Oh, you're kidding, this man's angry about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands I saw that just far.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there the night!
But if you love it and you listen to music - this music today she's always touching you as much.
I don't know why there are so many misunderstanding comments on what Paul Mason says, maybe they have been posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sport section there is a article on the foot that waits for your comments.
Super article, very real.
Since Tony Parson's movie, there is a lack of reports that really reflect the reality of the Northern England culture.
It is not surprised that Paul Mason had well taken the social and political context, he understands the things.
Northern soul has always lived, but she has been vampirized by capitalism, and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can take a ear if you're in the London region in November : 99psoul will be able to spend new soul wine, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Bethsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "will always the same story", but this is a small article well written and well thought.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I think you're happy to miss Newsnight.
Last train for Victoria/Exchange and go to Wallgate.
By driving pills.
What the car before Wigan was, 15 minutes walking from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginning of the Northern soul scene are described in a excellent episode of the police series George Gently titled Gently Northern Soul, which is in Newcastle in 1968.
The business becomes more emphasising.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never took an opportunity to ratify an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan : Netanyahou does not search for peace because he wants to continue to take up-coloniser (which was also the case of Rabin).
Of course, Rabin, Netanyahou and all their electors prefered the peace-colonization occupation.
He cut his clothes, put them on the rock, and entered into the water.
A Israelite slaughtered them.
The Israeli representative is angry and voting: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time."
The Palestinian representative (UN) has added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the Palestinian bipolary government and will not decrease the guard...
That this moves to the anti-Israel is a proof, it is not the searching purpose ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translated: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always so since the policy is globalized ...
Evitablely, obviously...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certainly losing!
For Israel's creation you don't answer.
What force report allowed Israel's creation?
Antisionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report!
You doubt?!!!
Moreover, it turns not only around Russell Brand, but the journalists of the Guardian seem to have bad to go beyond anything he shouldn't say.
Many of what he says are only trillions of pseudo-chomskists written not other.
This is the proof that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a follow-up of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves it well, what would mean that it's a matter of immature).
A truly zealous load, with just a conscious suspicion that Russell Brand tells some truths, perhaps truths to those who prefers not thinking.
Accompanying, this feeling will be more wide!
I can understand why Brand horripile some: he sometimes speaks deeply and after all the absurdness of the tablet he actually gives the impression of being a starting popular, but all of this story of not voted has been completely uninterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to say just to the people not vote and rather crush the arms and ignoring the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles / videos that he has posted, he said that it is essentially voting for the only five years for the work or Conservers (or Lib Dems I think) and restricting the democratic commitment to this, the two parties are unnecessarily unnecessarily (in degrees lowly different) and gouvernment in favour of special interests, multinational and rich enterprises, at no time it is not just saying to ignore the policy because these parties are not in our name: it is to insist that it is to say that it is just to develop locally, multinational businesses and organizations in the course of a few years.
I don't say that I'm necessaryly agreed with his solution (for I think that I am politically active in submitting his requests can go to a couple with the fact of voting, since the politicians are rounds that will change their opinions if they can really lose elections), but it is raised to see all these condensing answers that say that this unbelievers that Jesus said to young people do not take the punishment of voter and just expecting that everything will be better because it is really developing his arguments.
His solution is extremely discussed, and it would be well if people discussed what he really said, rather than just labeling it as irresponsable and putting the concerns of him and a large number of persons left in account.
Yes, thanks.
The vote was completely deformed.
The inutility to throw a bulletin in a urn every five years was deeply nervous to me, since my vote does not really contain anything.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who are locally taking account of their elections.
In addition, I react the idea that Russell Brand's proposals are not its (written by others).
It is sufficiently intelligent to have his own proposals and ideas, even though those are strongly influenced by the type of thinkers and universities anti-stablishment resulting from the anticulture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskist billeves".
I am instead convinced that it would be successful to convince Suzanne in a debate.
Maybe this is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a verranda, even the head heights accompanied to the mount!
Like Max Keiser, who first attacked Russel but ended by become one of his fans and invited him in his emission, it's too easy to attack him without really understand where he wants to come.
It is possible in a political talk that exists from generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media, including the Guardian, since generations.
This “fronde” especially shows my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of the history where home historys have become minority, and where the exchanges of specialists have been made to the benefit of condensed types of Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I saw in the intellectual attitude of Peter Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, the need to take it to a guilt, a embassy leg.
They develop one of the very reasonable reasons, but this rationality is on these emissional legs that are the key of their thoughts.
I believe, instead, that the State was essential for Foucault.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificed thought, which is also the magic thought.
The problem of the report is resolved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchism, noo-lib and / or/or /-liberal pen ( of two terms the second marks a duration of the Status's rating desire , the first saver goes looking for State aid for its markets ) in terms of at least state / not all of the state at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is well-organized.
His thinking is built on the fault of the State: without this fault it does not delay.
Here this guilt, this elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
No other support.
The totality left remembers the good old time, the of his god of values, Staline, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you certainly read too fast a chouya if you took the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for a apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Peter Manent wouldn't be able to attack Michel by this bias...
The left is a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and collective, the difficulty that represents the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal society.
Whatever we agree or not with him, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this orchestrated cattle by human sciences from the hard left, which does not support the alliance of their mantras, is sufficientlyリable.
The narcism and the authorism of these people are unlimited.
A important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebelles", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chineses and other "years" I have been witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You did not have the joy of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were sympathy with me when they learned that I was Russian.
The last time in Russia, in the 1990s, in a market.
The Chinese thinks like the whites!
My family lived in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou in the middle of the 20th century ago, and I hear some of them to hold a violent anti-Blancs proposal.
My dad's not happy that her old daughter's lucky with a White.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since 1990 and especially in the past few years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is promising outside major cities, and through this prosperity people travel to the foreign and see how others live.
For what was told me, the Russians have particularly prejudice to temporary workers without qualification originating in Caucase and Central Asia, working in households and in areas where they have many chances to be exploited by their employees or faced with high criminality and violence.
While I lived on the rivers of the Iensiya River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australian opinions on the Chinese and Aboriginals.
It's really strange that a foreigner tells me that I don't support the Chineses, while I met them two in my life (of one to the foreigner), I have not kept wrong memorys, and in fact, all people have been very good towards London is the only reason why I remembered that they were Chinese.
Unless we don't remember who we meet, everyone values, how to remember who he was.
You know what's strange?
That you and the other Russian here are talking about Chineses as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're always going out with that White.
How many Chinese men are in comparison with whites?
Nobody, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly left-handed groups as the trade syndicate of the magistrate...
@Marabout: Excuse me, but the judicial environments are frankly marked.
When in the Judge Syndicat, it is only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its participation may be made from the relativeness of the application of the laws in the courts, it commands to avoid two obstacles.
The observer's political vision as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law is then obliged to renew the basic assessment.
The measure of its inconservation in all the courts' acts, including parking, is forced to operate a distinction between the error and the parity of the judges.
It would only be said that the acts of justice do not divide among these three groups.
Pretension and misconsciousness does not pertinent to an objective analysis.
And if all this has not been analyzed, how can it be said that justice is improved in France?
If it's only by statistics, it's a very low part of it.
The previous preamble allows us to integrate what follows in the third ratio.
That's the corruption* of the magistrate.
Sensible subject in proportion of the power of abuse*, which is confined to the judicial institution capable of such heritage.
The field considered is the of the spoliation* of heritaries made up to the means of scroqueries at the procedure* by successive genealogists mandated by noters.
This professional has a good amount of EUR 150 million, while benefiting from the coverage* assured by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a party was reported in the comments following the first publication.
When this is joined by the statistical improvement of the previous comments*, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many differences between genealogist and heritage to make this spot, a whole set of contrary laws to all heritage laws.
The presentation of European statistics ignoring such racional criteria, isn't it then an elaborated form of lie?
Prices are certainly totally prohibited.
Another material to raise disabled persons.
It can be said, but my brother has one of the whole land tricycles, built as much as his size and his weight, and it really allowed him to benefit from full air as ever a normal roller, with routines and swimming necks, couldn't be.
As we say, the bones and the colors...
Tankchair looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair has the EPIQUE air.
I think the Will's inventor has never been cleaning a dog crystal on a chain.
I'm sure my sister would like all the terrain, but it's just too pretty.
The rolling round of a long distance would be perfect for a disabled person with a long-board pencant.
There are collines that would like them.
The prices seem to be actually high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a slope, then “you see”.
The whole country tricycle seems very useful.
All persons with disabilities are not poor, however.
Many of them have insurance of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
This is that the rolling skin market is a nick, so they may allow to practice high prices for things that they know that we need.
We can't really say that Whill is a minimumist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a break, it's not expected to make it.
I am conscious of the fact that the “long distance” routine does not arrive on the market, because it seems that there is no way to lead this wicked thing.
About 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, when intensive bombs were deeply pooled.
Two million human beings are prisoners in the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupant power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and adolescents who are less than 18 years old.
The eight-year-old children lived all their lives under the Israeli block!
The unique situation in the world, unacceptable, also illegal situation, since this block is inflicting a “collectional punishment” with all the civilians of Gaza.
" The entrepreneurs who work on their projects have a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
Oh, that's not the wood language, instead of beton and armed...
The references are here to support a argument or fact.
Antisionist...
The good ciment goes in the tunnels!
The black market is certain and recognised.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007.
The unique situation in the world is unacceptable for any person who has a heart and moral sense.
US has a well-guarded field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time necessary to control because the dictatorship (which you know) was excluded!
Don't forget also that Morsi had rebuilt the blockus!!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egypten ...
Gaza's children live on a subterranean strongness, built against the population that chosen their grandfathers!
With a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much better than Airbnb.
It is the same definition of the share economy, without lucrative purpose.
Many are looking for a piece of night on Couchsurfing.
So it's to pay (or at least hope) in another way.
It's always much less pretty than a hotel, if you need to find the good addresses.
Furthermore, owners and locators who are trusting are often stopping using Airbnb and treated directly in species, with so Airbnb.
Where the community is in all this.
“What does she place on”?
There's no problem with the word, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word 'to leave' is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
This is an international journal now, where you wouldn't notice.
It would be better to have a good assurance for the boat, make sure it's 100% in accordance with all security rules and ask those who managed channels and rivers the authorisation to practice a commercial activity (which they will certainly reject). I have a ship and I tried to see how to see the louer (in all honestity) on Airbnb, En bref, it's really a...
Have you thought that ships can be moved, shooted, filled, etc.?
The penichs are so slow that if someone tried to steal her, she'd always be near where you left it.
Or distorted by pirates...
All those somalian immigrants who come here and attack our penins...

Not Marine Le Pen hasn't right!
Population?
There's no truth other than that who exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 1500,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in riches between the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends?
Who defends what?
In 2017, the messe tonight!
Capitalism isn't up!
High funding, speculal, play with our business, with our first materials, so our purchase, our foods, and our health care structures, so our institutions are debts.
They are a threat in our daily life by the same and our money they hold..
All this is in the benefit of those hiper-mega-oceans of the fridge.
As far as the contrary proved, FH said, "We have no name, my enemies have no face, my enemies, this is the finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former minister of the economy, Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, only responsible for the crisis of 2007.
Is there nobody else of competence?
You call this How: Return his clothes, down his pants?
Primary and popular reaction
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee had really "refuzzed" to help survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that no party seemed to be certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cousin in the area.
The sea was wooden at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the struggle ended after the sun's sleep, making any more harder rescue operations.
Compare this with the next battle, the Maluins, where, on photos showing survivors in being sealed, we see a peaceful and full-day sea.
Moreover, the saviors knew that there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, this really does not match what I remembered about this battle, then I made a rapid research on Wikipedia:
“A certain confusion was among the German ships about the type of the two shocked crews, who had lost in the black after shooting the shooting, and a shooter began.
Leipzig lived something in fire, but when he approached, he saw that it was just a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German vessels, is late to the battle and lives the Monmouth, crushed and seriously damaged but still moved.
After he pointed out his projectors on the ship's board, the proposal to become rejected and open the fire, finally covering the ship.
Without reliable information, from Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stop research at 22.15 p.m.
It is worried about reports that indicates a British kitchen in the area, he puts up the north. ”
So, if that's true, the Germans, tasting in darkness before the raying, didn't know that a ship had been filled, and therefore they couldn't search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important kitchen of the Royal Navy in the area that could seriously damage them, so in the confusion they degued to benefit their progress.
They were far away from their base, and Spee had very conscious that they should go through many ships of the king Navy.
The sacrifice of Crowdck had already caused them to be angry and had covered them about half of their munitions, condemning them so when they were finally taken.
Several votes are taken to the UNPU to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election is that of the fact definitely unlikely.
This is a courageous position that would also touch the right left elections on.
But Nooon, it's a blague.
FOR THE IDE CATTER AND PROPOSITION FOR THE INSCRIPTION TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAGISTRATS
When does the prohibition of trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality among citizens be tolerated?
Understanded by policies, whose society's vision is limited to these sectors, it is always inclined to engage those who will benefit from their inadmissibility to prevent true political actions, which really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is at the measure of their sufficientness.
I met them in the metro to midday with their small pancarts of sub-justice" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of political trade unions with members put their large power to the service of its party.
It would not defende the same theories if legal or extremely right signs were designated for personalities of its border and settled against them with a legal and medium-sized war.
Your confirmations are totally free.
Yes, now the right defeats the judiciary is just that she has made facts that resurrected it!
There is no example of the left personality that had so much to do with the Justice but all those who have been subjected to his attention have not been treated in favour.
On the other hand, there is still a need to remember that the trade of the courts which are left is not the only trade of magistrates and that it is minority.
A minister supports the trade unions with both commitments shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The syndicat you quote may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great to the Chancellor, it is not a secret.
Now it is asked if the "mission" of certain judges is no longer out of the way to teach.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you kidding?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not officials like others: they're the only ones to have the power to put him in charge and to incarcerate it all.
Jade Goody?
What if no participants would never come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most afflicted weakness of glory is understood that X-Factor can just mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts the offer.
Many of them served as a tremlin to start a successful car.
The One Directorate is filled with the whole world’s cities.
Others then sold a lot of disks or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, which is in fact part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made the contribution of the Eurovision as well as others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the others participated in support in the United States.
In the 1970s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light divertissement stars from the British television.
Of course, some have fallen in the forecast.
But this is what happens in any way to most stars that do not participate in competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, have succeeded in doing others.
In any way, most of the songers / groups can better expect three albums and a better one.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebration comes in part of his marriage with a footballer who breaths through the mouth.
Most Americans know who's Jeremy Clarkson.
can only mean the end of a carriage
In fact, it is more chance to discuss on a carrière than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the cold flyers to guide in the garage of their father and balance three agreements on a primary school poem will certainly become stars and that the only question is how they want to touch before even a album.
And worse than ridicule: it sets a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that looks pretty rapidly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these people as an infinitely superstitious and ritual petris, while most of their ways are strictly equal to us and inspired, such as ours, of practical considerations in the daily.
Excluding that you are imprisonablely interpreting inversely.
If you are, but instead of say that the smooth is cut off of holy character, should it not be better to admit that our Marianne and our Molders have also a little sacred character?
Our biais is remembranced to see the sacred as a kind of well defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
It is very interesting in what it is.
It's the ephemer to switch the empty.
Nothing more.
Super articles, thanks.
The recent Paneonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is a illustration that the feeling of holy spirit is always alive.
Who believes still in the interpretations of the Archaeologists!
Any other discipline would go to the urges of the interpretations not of any scientists who deal with the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critical compared to disciplines for a little rigour?
Because what is valued for archaeology is also for the interpretations that gives the other disciplines.
This would bring a health modesty dose.
Your lack for the Archaeologists is absolutely unjust!
It is thanks to them that a constantly discovery of treasures, valuable witnesses to reconstitute the History, including society, and the example of comparable archaeology here is passive.
This method is not very old and before the archaeologists were instincts and knowledge, and they could be wrong.
Today, there are so many technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the crowds is better but can always be remised in cause by other discovery!
It is in full (and old) political about the callnism extended by the presistent Jean Clottes (cf its book The Phones of the Prehistory), especially the increased redistribution of the scientific controversy, compared to the editions La House des Roches).
Thank you for this strong instructional article
The historical men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could take it.
So it's over between us?
I really don't understand why we can't continue to three.
This newspaper is to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to drop in the ca?
No, but we're not against a theatre room above.
We couldn't look at a musical commodity instead, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have such a comment from your side.
It seems Mary Whitehouse's returning from the dead.
Because your test offer is almost finished, I could suggest you to go to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more home.
He prefers mikedow.
I can suggest that we all search for a journal that pays real, courageous journalists to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Soon than get ridden with these puerry shoes.
Not very bad.
Let's go.
If these "power shoes" shock you so much, you're not obliged to participate, isn't it?
You know also that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is so much possible to do both and publish a article on the anal sex?
Is that the subject you shock, or is it the fact that people strike?
However, there is the amateur video of the crash on the network...
Amateur video of the crash on the network...?
If the FOM has chosen to not show these images is only to protect its interests in any case of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or in another vehicle (e.g., deployed) in the circle.
But it had to be done soon before the type of whom we knew that it was coming, but for which the FOM did not judge good to advance the time of the department (TV, pub, money...).
But in addition to that, they protect the pilots.
Well see, I share this opinion too.
But it is also that if the very British FOM makes SC enter, she will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to fight the English that threatened then...
You leave on this blog my chart Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to break all your c*****s.
No, just not.
There were many conspirations in F1, but never one who puts commissarys in danger of death for a far away history of the possibility of victory of a pilot in the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that gets security because it's the FIA.
Smile to the size.
In view of amazing images, the absence of images allows the IFF to avoid genital issues of the type: How does the Commissioner act with a green dragon in full intervention and continue to do it after the accident (see complete video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is judged too violent than the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because it is clearly seen one of the Commissioners acts a green dragon, signs that the course can be re-educated normally and that it is more under a yellow drap.
Some comments show a shadow of F1.
Yes, car Etian, the course is no longer under the sight of yellow APRES the place of the accident, where the green dragon is actor.
That's the ordinary procedure.
The post of just availability in the accident (in the cases, it may be 10 meters after the accident) moves the green to tell the pilots to get a normal alert.
The sensationalism makes sale from the pub.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda office, but I was very afraid that, at the end, it was just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good to sell things to improve our sexual life.
Information does exactly the same thing.
Make buzz with information that you really don't need to worry is just to continue to fear people so that you can continue to control them.
"When the tablets are all about Ebola, we all touch the fear" It should be "depressing," not "all".
As a result of the medical reference, “allser” is better said in this context than “destroyer”.
I ask me whether all people who feel that Ebola could slow up by airway seeing that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too honour.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that is approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confond Ebola and Murdoch...
Good article, thanks!
A short and concise article that ridiculizes joyfully and firmly this pseudo-journalism abject.
That's a good thing to rigour me.
I am depressed that the media talk about most things with this optimism instead.
The goal is still once again to keep us sufficiently angry and angry (and if to arrive to the historical) for the government may make us disappoint when it needs.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to be a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have Ebola's crisis in the absence of any case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crisis he himself invented.
Is there nothing fundamentally problematic with the idea to dominate by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still from this world almost 35 years later.
Besides the context of the 1980-90s, this was to be horrible.
I'm blue, living with the certainty of passing it for years...
Witness perfectly unnecessary.
Like always when we're talking about sciences.
Not only witnesses serve nothing: they are taken isolately, they cannot serve scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of facts.
@trafic: The witnesses cannot serve scientific material.
This may be because of the need to take questions to patients in psychiatrist when they have reliable observations from closers.
My psychiatric file indicates that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her beauty mother.
This is therefore a objective symptom.
When I say it's wrong, it's a subjective witness without importance.
Ah, because the awareness of a fact (= here this witness, who obtains contamination and efficiency of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific course?
What are you based on research, then?
About fantasms?
Are you at the same level of fanatist theories and facts (= giveing a verified testimony)?
“Resilience”: the word bidon deducted by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, which takes for great psychologists after having read D'anemburg.
@Jim: There are fully empty bugs in the psys.
Cyrulnik took us the “resistance. ”
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he'd bear us a reliable scale of measure to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the air sensors could all save us from Farage and Companies?
Doesn't you think about the American team?
Very seriously, it's not * a good idea to resort the air Sentinels...
And why?
It was a great series and it would seem that those who resurrected it have conscious!
So let our salvation to all powerful who can make miracles.
But how are they going to make kids grown?
The only solution that comes to me is the kind of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
You know, the kids were cut off.
Ah, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP works for mystery.
So keep your American team.
Always in Supermartion?
It's not like if we don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I'm glad to see this (that it is a adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of redistributing older people.
The series has almost never stopped being distributed here in Australia; it makes at least 40 years of age that we have episodes of one hour at Saturday and Sunday at 06.00 p.m.
Since a few years ago the free digital television has been arrived, it is on one of the second order commercial chains and it is always possible to see at these hours.
And in addition to the episodes of a half hour pass at 5:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "shiny" boy of 60 years, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mont of the temple" in or under the mosque of the splanades!!!!
Radical sionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all the israeli crowds under and around the mosque of the splanades since several decades have not been allowed to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if there is another place.
Can you be in argentine?
This mount is not searched for the simple reason that it is the colline on which the splanned mosques has been built.
His sum of Rocher, or Rocher, makes sailty in the midst of Omar's mosque.
For the Muslims, Mahomet is taken into Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is the mountain of Moriah where Abraham failed and sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda but information, search K1K1.
Israel also accounts of his extremists, it is good to regularly remind him, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Abigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, which had accepted the plan to two states, and has continued to discuss it!).
It is also good to show how Jerusalem's anointing is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognise his own?
The shortest of the Jewish blague: "God be loved!"
To overcome the tourism in Israel, young naïdes are often shown to us in half of the beach.
The reality is normally different from what we show advertising, as we can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared at once.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
It hurts that the photo of Reuters did not take on the photo the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the temple and prefer to cast the Jewish faithful in contrabase, praying to the Wall of Lamentation.
@Mat, if this photo strikes you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photograph, but this woman and ideology that she has to be sentenced.
This system is not sweet and will end in smiling.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be broken, large enterprises have greatly benefited from their employees.
They have succeeded to convince their employees that they have the chance of have a job and that they can't allow to increase payments, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave a more important payment to the small elite at the sum.
You're right, it's not tough, but it's not gonna change in this country only when workers really speak of a single voice.
Instead of raise and smell when someone else makes grief, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their grief is not only about their problems, but also shows to your employer that people are not uncomfortable.
Unless we leave the democracy, in the case wherever, it's careful.
I am totally agreed.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American enterprises have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worse.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end up.
That's because we're in democracy that took it.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of society detained by these people in short-term circulation of national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but this is exactly what the mechanism for regulating differences between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the Agreement.
The Greens are against this project and try to advertise people about the immaginable defects that this agreement will be on our lives.
It's just recently starting to talk in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your duty.
Didn't Churchill say "the blood, the laugh and the laughs"?
That's what's going on, while the digital money has no reason to cut down and even less powder on trees.
The next weak maillon will certainly be the market of the car.
This man had the right, in XVIII there were trade signs in all regimens.
In the very French Catholic Army, there is a sacrifice dimension.
Let it (finally, his officers, others, no one knows) believes the strength of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut up.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, value crisis, shortly: the dilution of the nation's idea, have this small recline, is comfortable.
Even if for her, it's even more inconfortable...
They're still missing you the synagogue of married men, celibatarys, married women, celibatarys, lost dogs and I don't know anymore
If you do not correctly write the French, I'm singing.
You're warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of Category interests, the professionals protected by trade unions are already sufficiently undergoing, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are requested not to ride for the fear of the risk of a official.
It is very well to imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without syndicates, or then without the right to green as in Germany, in contrast with the protection they play.
Except assured disaster.
And with the charrets that are prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignore in reality...
Sybill ignoring I made allusion to military and other officials, because it's the subject here commented...
Delete the "intermediate of his delegates" in article 8 of the Constitution of 1946.
It will be: "8.
Any worker participates in collective determination of working conditions as well as business management."
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of the informative power.
And yet you have opened, probably read, then commented a article specifically entitled The Great British Bake Off review. ????????????
Wait, the section was here, all empty.
I thought he had to start the conversation.
In any way, it's Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well murdered.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (cooic tromper: it was wine) in the history of the television.
So, the ball mmmh...
Thrones game!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of fun that the emission is slowly finished with a swimming winner of the worst ; no one has done a sort of "boom, here my shooting shooting now and swing before your master"!
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally affected them?
Previous weeks, all these external persons were held differently.
And there's also this idea of " playing security, always the next week" that disappears last week.
I like kitchen, but I don't think I'm infringing this.
I am grateful to those who do it and offer us so a great divert and tried to try new things.
Previous for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of the last year, the marriage gateway, was absurd.
Professionals generally put days to do, and they had to break up at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to depart, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
Chez Luis, the only real default they found was a little seed base (if I am agreed with Hollywood to say that the green glass on the moulin of Richard did not live, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to say that several challenges in this series appear a little artificial because of the time that is imposed.
There is also the cancer that guides, with the sun wind cuts.
Decisively, all of us are successful at this time.
A bad moment to pass for humanity, we hope.
You confound sun winds and ultraviolet radiates.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone shock that is fairly formed by the impact of residual sun wind and UV.
So even if the magnic field was fail, there was no enough solar wind to "have" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less than UV and "cancer".
Happy that the ozone bag does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If humans are limited to humans, they are interested in allowing us to have oses (Vitamin D synthesis), to shoot us (such as the infrared), to modify our immunity system and, it seems to be, to improve our moral.
The ozone bottle blocks cancer UVC and lets UVA and most of the UVBs pass.
You know that you are not obliged to be condemnant and to consider your interlocutor as a stayer when you make a comment?
Overall for a smaller precision that was understood in the comment, which itself heard proof of pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanom habit, the UV only makes ACCELER its development.
They don't Provoquént.
For evidence, all frozen people have not forced melams.
It is, when a toubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, better do not listen because the UVs are necessary to all humans.
The exception, on the contrary, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause the melam.
Can we get it?
And more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass him to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it has established that everything can be increased if there is a sufficient force and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use of which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a first line communication material.
But for us,
It's a good choice.
most of those interested have established that all can be increased if sufficient force is applied.
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already further?
This breach is made in each debate.
I decided to tell them.
It's the fourth blue on the piece I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before specific softwares are installed, you imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and that is badly seeing how it could return it.
So, uh, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been correctly installed and that is therefore enrolled with the installed plant test code.
I don't know how they're doing these things.
But will they put test software on all?
Ebay photos clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connection.
ah the article for bobo by excellentity.
We want few cherished products and we're surprised that industrials produce in "industrials" It's put forward to or but all teachers and smaller trade are concerned How to swim good, bio Avac 1650€ (Med salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities there where he hears it.
For my part, the food is one.
Go without a punishment, I'll smell you
Bobos, or better boboes, are called people who see the world through an ideological 'software' that leads them to deconnect realities.
That's the total degroupment of thought-resons.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example they intend to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
There are also experts in Tartuferia, joining this the left-caviar, which are sometimes discovered, for example condemning CO2 rejections while passing their holidays to Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixed of solar ideology and tartufery, so do not be surprised to meet critics about them.
Waouh, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theory, as well as for all associated details (avion, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the coffee left?
But you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just a ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short schools.
Boboécolo is actually part of but is only the most visible franchise of the schools because it is the one that infectes the media.
It's a beautiful turnafa.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this turnafe in the face.
She's so bad that she looks like a nine woman.
Chut, you're on the plate.
It must be part of the art microcosm to understand the surprising beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not been innumerable for decades to study and flat great artists.
It is not the fact that Emin does not know drawing and seems always obsessed by the same subject.
It is important that she really has become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
That's, it's of *l'art*.
No, it's cotton.
The fact that Emin does not know drawing
That's not really a deceited fact.
This is instead a view.
Except if the only thing you can appreciate is real dog playings that smoke by playing at billard.
Judging the art may be difficult, but not in that case.
Drawing, it's much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for just this, a photo's going to do this.
The author also speaks of Emin's expression.
Look again and let the image speak of yourself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are also economies: equation activities, the number of horses of the Republican garden or the status of the generals that aren't in active service....
(The honestity is to say that France decreases its effectiveness, but as all countries have done, sometimes more dramaticly, to begin by Great Britain.
It's only half encouragement...
The operational without support, it finds its limits fast!
A unique approach, at the time when we observe the weaknesses, the insufficientness of our defence tool, especially in Sahel.
A bad cut for the relevant local collectives, who lose a dimension of their activities, or a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond : That's what I said, look out where to make economies but especially not at home, my home is not really possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, see otherwise where dogs are certain.
That all those who have buried little or promised the military thing is coming to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there's no money weakened in this perimeter and this without smiling...
As regards the same position in all public functions and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: Really relaxed: look at public job inflation in other ministers and you will understand why Defense can consider a little loaded!
Ben yes, the economies on which everyone agrees to say it's necessary to do, but it's like somewhere, isn't it?
There's no powder, those on which it goes to the killer when it comes home, the poor ones.
It should be done but especially that it does not go above me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Gugnols, go!
What to close the Grace Val will fail our Sahel defense tool?
As regards local collectives, history is repeated to each post, motherhood, hospital and hospital.
But everyone is for the well-known economy.
It is strange, a major UMP who wants compensations and does not rejoice in public expenditure.
This article is really the most exciting thing I never read!
This awesome moment where the first three people who comment the same bad blague.
It's the depression to discover his face Facebook and to see that 80% of his friends started their status by the phrase “This awesome moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarance scenes where someone shoots on his ex in the bus and goes to work and only takes account of his shooting back to his shooting.
It's not funny, it's completely con.
Nevertheless, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been learned to shoot his emotions and to shut the dents.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who has the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can't comment.
You don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe what this article is the most amazing thing I never read!
Charlie really has shown that he is all above the top of the cosmic universe that is satiric journalism!
I'm going to get it back!
I must be able to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they finally have the illumination and discover the unbelievable flexibility and the unpersistent genius that jails from the clavier of Mr Brooker as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really noble.
Of course they're not women or travesters.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracy: the increase of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until the new order, we make the right to save our planet by states that play tortuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into hand.
With the committee they planned to energy, all these beautiful recommendations were enrolled ....
Translated by : Eolians and firms are the rounds of tomorrow.
All financed by the con-dependent.
I ask you to stop this pronucleary talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radio-activeness is much more nervous at the level of its waste and in the case of accident.
While the subsidiary is not controlled in its integrity, it should be better to limit the laboratory.
Renewable energys are our only salvation, with a clearly decrease of our consumption.
The electricity by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is nothing concerned.
Nuclear electricity is CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by the elolic or PV renewable is already more than GES on other stages, especially gas, or worse carbon as in Germany, to compensate the interim.
Replace the nuclear by the elolic or PV renewable would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I'm not insulting you, I'm a state doctor in physical sciences 1981 more I've done nuclear physical research I've put you the challenge to prove to read instead of what I've said.
For what I haven't said is you who prepare me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany, you have never answered what I said and as all the people of right to democrate the speaker I never do it.
I also cite to you the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is a non-renewable and inefficient means to reduce GES emissions and should be arrested.
0 Emission if you do not account for the extraction of the uranium and construction and if you don't contain the gas vessel of a lower effect that Co2 is true to the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear central in water vacuum and a little in the waters of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "a gentleman of South Asia"...!!
The last time, Pakistan wind Hindustan.
This is not mysterious, most of the Indians who make comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it's a good show of your mind.
It would have been like if they had qualified India of South Asia's Gender...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but have a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a full Pandore box of corruption and mafiosi.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening match was very interesting, the Colkata Athletic is 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of ways to do.
In comparison with the billions and milliards that India offers to the IPL's cricket and now on football, how can we reval with our "bruying neighbors"...
The low cost course is payable to the low launcher.
Damn for a so beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design is shown only with a too cold helium.
So we may not be in a defect of design, but implementing...
On the contrary to the alone space that is a private society, it seems well that sozous belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is his own assuranceer..
They may go pay the satellites in fregates that you know..
This is so harder than many media take the only titles of articles - and many readers have only these titles.
In total this creates an incorrect impression against the content of the article itself.
In fact, indeed, the title is not appropriate, it is injustly concerned with the project, while it is just a launcher problem.
