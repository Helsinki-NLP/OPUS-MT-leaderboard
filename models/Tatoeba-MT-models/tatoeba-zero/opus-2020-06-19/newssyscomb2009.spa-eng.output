Triunfo of the right popular in Austria, together with 29 %
The previous elections to the Austrian Parliament have taken according to the first approached results, a valuable deficit of both parties of the current large coalition and a express strengthening of the right-related party.
Some strong and special losses have suffered from the Austrian People ' s Party (OVP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer was severely engaged.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the Chief of the State of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares its triunfal return to national policy.
According to the approached results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 per cent of votes, so that 5.5 per cent of votes are lost in comparison with the last elections of 2006.
The worst has still been completed by the OVP that lost 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
The worst results, literally catastrophic, are in the history of these two major Austrian parties from Poguerra and especially for the people who convoked these previous elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP was out of coalition, the people had a significant benefit in the preference to the SPO.
However, it is clear that the voters punished them because they left the naufragar government.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the division of the President of the party and, until now, vicecanciller, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this Monday could be reached at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This evolution would clearly facilitate the path of the constant and closer start point of the election results, i.e. the renewing of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right popularist parties - the liberalists (FPO) have winned about 18 percent and the BZO, a 11 percent of the votes - and the social democrats expressed their fears that the same year would be repeated in 1999 when the populations negotiated with the populations (the FPO was an unity, but in 2005 was moved from BZO) to a coalition government that came to generate sanctions by the European Union.
For this evolution that has clearly made Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to cooperate with any party and that it already turns back to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach the Parliament, although he had slightly lost and departed from the third to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of the four percent and therefore does not form a part of the Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can be frozen
If it is not possible to resolve the problem of checa scientists who have been accused in India by collecting illegally scharbachos, it could be a cold of Czech-India's relations, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg.
This showed the minister in New York, after the meeting today with his Indian Homologo, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then, then it would be safely reached to this cold," found after the meeting organized by Checa initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in the legal matters difficultly can be put the executive.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švacha, which was exempted of accused and punished with a currency, the Government may negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in which the case was issued.
"It could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years of prison, it would be the best, according to Mukherjee, that would appeal to the highest instances.
Then it may request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence freely, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague was expressed in the same terms during the meeting.
"He recommends to appeal to the Supreme Court and then would be possible the indulgence," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter into the matter is by obtaining the condemned a "respective legal support", expressed the Indian Minister.
On the other hand, he said that such a type of support was already obtained by the Indian party.
"We have the most interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," commented Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as stated by its colleagues, the Czech Republic stressed the problem of the Czechian entomologys of a great importance.
"We really consider the prisoner and condemning these checos scientists aware of tremendous error," announced.
The Minister reviewed the answer to the question of whether he received the promise of the Indian party to take care of the matter.
"I've received a lot of promises," he only found.
A arbitrary cheque struggle on the sea
I am close to a wall map, in which it represents Australia around the sea.
It is not interested, however, that the continent is only a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also to the marine fund that it rodes.
The region is at the same time as a single continent," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuossso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working at the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and Sea.
His head, Director of the Division, the Checa lawyer Václav Mikulka, continues to be exposed and, sometimes, complete.
Gobern this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The marine background has a little known world, rich in natural sources until now.
It can be found oil and other mineral primates, but also unknown organisms that lead to the key for the development of cancer drugs.
The fund is larger than the firm land
Coast countries have started discussing oldly the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these are entitled to the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the called Continental Borde, which sometimes extends to some hundreds of miles from the coast of the given country.
This has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
"Singlely, through the continental Borde is understanding the part of the marine fund and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It comes to the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, i.e., pure economic area," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country given to the Commission, for the delimitation of the external borders of the continent border, must be provided with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
" One of our tasks is organizing a technical and legal specialist assistance committee.
The committee has reached five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the three last countries mentioned have come forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, the success of Australia had a global impact because it was the first that was essentially expanded its marine rule.
However, New Zealand also accompanied it - the sea-floor surface that gave him the commission last week is of 1.6 million square miles, i.e., almost six times more than the size of the state.
Both countries have inverted millions of pain for their study.
The winning that will be removed from the use of the marine fund will, as they promise, be unworthy.
Other states are also presenting their requests.
They can do it until the ten years since they ratified the Montego Bay Trade.
There the Continental Border begins the region of the Ocean fund declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity".
There, no nation has an exclusive position.
The law of exploitation in these areas is to be administred by the treaties established by international institutions.
"But the marine fund, however, is not a gold threat," said director Mikulka, emphasized, "when its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its scheme defined by contract."
Cheques in the Pacific
And today, a part of the marine fund belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the Eastern Block within the Joint Interocean metal organization.
This resulted in 1991 with a treaty as investors as the same as other few states called "the pioneer investor".
It is able to explore the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the inversor is something greater than the former Czechslovakia.
The fund there is accidental, it is something as well as a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetal concreation rings containing niquel, copper, cobalt and mananese," adds the Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A macedonian employee of the Division, Robert Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of concreation.
Remembers us a small patch or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who, according to the legend, came back to the Golem.
During the release of rehenses, the command of special forces was on the place of action
To solve the crisis of rehenses, the Egyptian government had requested the aid of Germany and the experts came.
When the situation was done seriously, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More details are always known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and Internal Ministry in Saving Action, the German special forces also participated in indirectly.
As a result, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office also had experts in the field of logistics of technical benefits.
As they informed the phones of the ministers on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because of seculars, taking into account a violent release, let them go to their prisoners and escaped.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid of Germany to use it as a support in the place.
"Happyly it wasn't that moment," said a porter of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the asshalants had entered a group of travellers composed of 5 German, 5 Italians, a Romanian and 8 Egyptian partners.
After the sequence in the southern wilderness of Egypt, the residents brought them from one side to the other in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of secutors was unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible savings payments.
While the healthy and saved people arrived to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released rehens were under the protection of the German Ambassador.
He didn't say any word about the release details.
At first in Berlin there was no information on the turn of them to Germany.
According to the "Image", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's aircraft and arrive in March.
The United States Representative Chamber does not approve the saving package
The first chamber of the United States Congress slowly failed a large saving package of $7,7 billion for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States Representative Chamber rejected 227 votes against 206 the Government's package to save financial markets.
Despite all calls by President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme that should be limited to disorder on financial markets.
With a dramatic action, unexpected defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $7,7 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of democratic negotiations, had requested Members to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet occurred", admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones went over 6 percent or 600 points.
This was the cause of the concerns of investors that the State saving package could fail.
On the end of the vote, and after the failure was made public, it went again.
Experts have other serious turbulents in the international financial markets.
To stop the programme in force, both the Representative and Senator ' s Chamber must be adopted.
The organizations register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisations:
According to a study, the volume of sales of travel reserves for the next months increased in comparison with the last year - even the winter time in more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the debilitated conjunction, the desire to travel from Germans remains as previously.
As the Monday reported the Germany’s travel association (DVR) in Berlin, travel reserves for winter flights registered a volume of sales in comparison with the same period last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reservations for the months of autumn have already been in number.
Thus, the volume of sales from travel agencies in October was almost one hundred per cent compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results is GfK's figures that are analyzed information on reserves in 1200 travel agencies and computers nearly all the market.
The collected data are the travel reserves until the end of August 2008.
Because of the deficit rate of the dollar over all travels to the United States, DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost a third.
The preferential destination points for the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Over all organized trips are very favorite, Klaus Laepple, DRV's President.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenditure are "move calculable for the customer during a individual travel".
Among other things, consumers can pay money with pre-reserve discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
In the summer months, travels were well reserved, so that the volume of sales in comparison with the past year again went - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who performed a travel, comparing the last year, slowed.
My first October Festival
The shoes of the festivals under the sky opened on the Balneary without end, the bird in jars of a litre and the famous people who were clothed in traditional designers' battles.
A deb in a camping shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much common.
She is ruby, the moderate on the television and takes a traditional bevery clothing.
I have the dark hair, I'm a student and my clothes is already used.
But there's one thing that one of us: we're only in a campaign shop, the photographs have already shooted up to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very lisonyous about everything because I'm first in October.
So makes friends.
Traditional swimming trajectory seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in October, from the north of Germany, my feelings of well-being with a traditional beverage until this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Teresa Prade, it's not all so much.
Almost all the world brings the traditional bever or cute pants; no one seems to be given if or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my delantal receives a rare look at the side of a platform stand in the chocolate.
A municipality calls my attention on my delantal that had been dressed in wrong way: "The left side is alone, the half is the virgin, in the right side is compromised, behind is old."
Oh, God, now I'm cut back to the left.
"He's good," I'm not saying.
Others are not worried about many of the subtle methods to flee and bring gorges where it is written "To drink to get clothes!" and show, without requesting them, their naked ball.
A young man who is conducted in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, is from England and is also the first time in October.
He seems to be "gorgeous", which is expressed with a very long "or".
I know it after he put his vessel on the side of a bird litro that finished drinking.
I put it directly on the side of the fire mouth, most people think that it's a swimming cube.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows drinking very much.
Others don't have a lot of luck and can't consume so much alcohol.
On the eighth night the health groups run on the party place and need to be worried about poor cups.
Health provides always in group - soon four people are always taking the ways covered from a campaign shop to the other.
This works as with most visitors: they come up, go back to bags.
It is not seen who suffers the degrees of alcoholism and is on the way.
"These are those who can't be anymore," answered me a health career, responding to my question and disappeared.
Police injuries identified by the police
It was identified by the 63-year-old peatone after being shocked by a vehicle in the Essex garden.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident in Shenfield Road on Wednesday.
The woman was brought to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspect of nervous conduct.
Since then, it has been put into freedom under fidelity.
Turkey extended its diplomatic horizonts
As far as Turkey was entitled to be a member of the European Union, the European powers would like to spend within this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosforo, perhaps only 20 steps towards Asia, there is one of the most interesting religious ones of the disaster imperial ambition.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacenter style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is placed to spend the end of the platforms and takes two towers, one for each skin, parking to all a typical German shoeting.
The stone is sweet.
The building in your complex is a few decades.
But once the shooting bag over, there is no doubt of what was the size of the company that this was the western door.
The station was inaugured in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this rail rail that was shocked to Damasco, Bagdad, and more beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His holiday ways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
As a result of the relative isolation of the circumstance regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it falls down.
the British rule and when the forces progressed in Egypt, they moved to the Turkeys and their German alliance outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a ammunition train was explosed by destroying its designed piece.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then the station was cut down and remained at the margin of the history.
But today, this rail carriage, the entrance door to Anatolia and all Eastern centres, serves at least symbolically - to highlight the will of Turkey to extend its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, which is the Government, the ACP, has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the circumstance regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, both Palestinian Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new external policy, I went to a letter and I went to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leaders of the ACP, expert on the external policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - a few ten hours and a half later - after a sacudi travel, which produced the chains of the ancient world in the famous documental The Night Mail, I arrived to the Turkish capital - new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the past.
However, the ACP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus.
who has sustained some suspects in Western and, in particular, Washington.
A taxi leads me to the ACP's headquarters, a ultramodern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a development suburb, rounded by medium-sized commercial centres and "power Pastels" where the managers of the media in business clothing - men and women -- are gathered at the first hour of the morning to make business agreements.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a central-right policy of almost any party in Europe.
I'm clothing, corbate, I'm sure he's still got a Blackberry.
"The goal of the external policy of the party is to re-integrate Turkey in its immediate neighborhood.
The Fria War was an anomaly," says me.
Turkey has been cut into relations with its internal.
Today we have to look at the East and West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or another.
You have to do both things.
"But surely at any time," asked I, "Turchia could be obliged to choose? "
"Turchia," he answered, "doesn't want to turn out that choice."
Then he pointed out a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken until that moment had been renewed about me: the relationships that Turkey has not only with the Middle East but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those rail lines that open the world to East Asian and the Middle East.
Another time at the Hydarpasha station, after a second without sleeping night, my thinking comes back to the two German Mrs Ritter and Mr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East would, mostly, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will bring me back through the Bosforo, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
There are no doubts in which the continent must be re-evited by this fascinating country.
Remember Videos: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: What musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (squella, 11 September) was responsible for the Philaric Orchestra of Guildford and the Coro.
As a part of the musical project for the city, in the next year, he founded its magnificent young crowd, Proteus.
It is supposed to be out for the age of 21, but at the time the Proteus sanged its end in 1979, several of us were finished in 20 years - only we refuse to give up to the core.
The name of "Proteus" (the mythological changer of shapes) represented the core will and the ability to execute any music that they are presented, madrigal or Messian, unless they were not accompanied or with complete orchest.
The musical versastigity produced by this core of young people was often surprising, always embarrassing, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the entusiasm for the music that has continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Often, death told us to let music speak for himself.
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
So there's only one to song!"
His shield was always absolutely clear and necessary, although never impositive, not too flowered.
Everyone out of the musical skarar, always ended at a greater level.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If some driver should have been caballer, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well in the two decades in which he directed the Gilldford Philadelphics from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the past 40 years, I have revised more than 100 of its concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed – on the other hand, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers that, in his words, simply "very one or two war horses very well known throughout the world".
We'll miss a lot of less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequence of William Woodruff (25 September) states that "in 1946, the studys of economic history were renewed in Oxford and in 1950 gathered an investigation piece of Houblon-Norman... at the same time he studied for a license title, one of mastery and one of the doctorate."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not completely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the Nottingham University, in which he completed a doctoral test on the UK cattle industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the British Rubber Industry title.
He passed from 1950 to 51 in the United States, enjoying a beach of Houblon-Norman, and the winter 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, nottingham finally left to Illinois.
The reason Woodruff decided to pass this part of his cart, it's unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Filistic Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because its photos in white and black, documental style, are fantastic.
They call me attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating protagonists with very respect.
A exposure shows much feeling.
Resino knows to capture magical moments."
Second attack for the survivors of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If his preceding had already a wide habitability, this new monovolumen presents a more broader internal space.
In all these areas, refined mechanisms are introduced, which increase the conducting comfort and allow more fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanicals should be indicated.
However, before analyzing the new model, it must be commented that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation in the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the employer by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sale phenomenon.
This is Japan's case, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Only in Japan has been sold about a million Jazz units from its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continente, with about a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese signing marketed a total of 83.000 Jazz units, estimates were estimated to 100,000 cars, which would have a growth of 17% in the European market in 2009.
With respect to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which is 6,7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, Spanish branch officers are expecting to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Only the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to pay the decline of sales in Spain.
Indeed, marking officials expect to end the year with a total of 22.000 marketed units, which is 4.000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in Honda's sales, its market share in Spain has increased 1,8%, compared to 1,6% of the past year.
The Japanese sign also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts in the coming of another new model.
This is Insight, a heavy of five doors and a compact size - 4,37 meters of length - from which the company nipon expects to market about 200,000 units every year in the world.
By markets and according to Japan's manufacturer estimates, 50 per cent of the Insight sales will be produced in the United States while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continente and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is expected for the first months of the year, since its presentation in society is carried out in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its coats.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (5 centimeters above), the width up to 1.69 metres (2 centimeters above) and the distance between edges up to 2.50 metres, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, instead, would not go and remain at 1,52 meters.
In addition to increased size, it also increases the internal habitat.
This winning should, on one hand, be included in a new platform and, on the other hand, the introduction of the fuel deposit in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Similarly, the capacities of smooth - which accounts for a double fund system - are up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity for the master of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are the version of the engine 1.4, as the ability of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as trash leds or the possibility of mounting panoramic cristal - is an improvement in access to the backward places.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second row have an open angle of 80 degrees, in front of the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
It's also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will contain two gasoline propulsors 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that achieves a smaller consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refination and at the same time a higher part of the engine regime.
The first mechanical of 1,2 litres obtained a power of 90 horses to 6.000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm to 4.900 turns.
This propulsor - which was previously reached 78 horses - presents a expenditure of 5,3 litres and some 125 gram CO2 emissions.
With respect to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now there is 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combinated consumption of 5,4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'batch' car that avoids colosions
To progress in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired this time in nature, in particular, in the abyss.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking on the base of the shipping flight, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robbot Drive, or BR23C first step in colision prevention technologies.
Nissan Motor Co Engineers have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology Advanced Research of the Prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Technology and Marke Management and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of the Nissan Security School.
This robot has the intention of strengthening the colision capacity to prevent the brand vehicles.
During his flight, each awake creates his own personal space in oval shape that seems very much to the Nissan Security School.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the skin, you can see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To create this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two meters of distance within a radio of 180 degrees front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that is immediately translated into the prevention of colision.
"In the time you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a ball and will immediately change from direction by turning its rounds in a right or larger angle to avoid colision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that evasion manipulation is completely instinctive.
If not, robot would not be able to react enoughly to avoid obstacles," Tushiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Labor and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a switch, robot can not be moved up or down, or in diagonal; only can be moved into two sizes and in the direction that allows you to turn your shifts and not infinite directions and ways like sweets.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation role, in addition to acceleration and disadvantage, so that the small robot avoids colisions.
"This device needs only to process information every few seconds, and act according to these data.
It does not require to store intuitive information or logical information of previous manuscripts, so it can work continuously with only a couple of twenty-five memory KBs.
It may be surprised, but we're not talking about memory gigs, nor even megas."
This is the first step to develop new colision prevention technologies, a vaccine technology that Nissan will be introduced in the series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and harder than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite browser GPS system to drive the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the path.
Of course before hypothecary
It should be recognised that the Department of the U.S. Department, in addition to having much liquid to make injections, is not a skilled machine.
Before the crisis, and to avoid the United States shipping in swimming hypotheses in questionable solvent banks, they have created an amenous and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or, the hotel of the bad credits... or the luxury.
The thermal aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about one, two and three times if it is the time to request a credit.
And, above all, where to do, what is probably your goal.
Of course, you have useful information, but little details.
It's a more page for adolescents than a website for all the public.
What if the game is completed?
So there's a school room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house, we're talking...
Morgan Stanley sold participation in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which would pay $9 million to buy 21 % of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a low-scale quote.
One week after discovered a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 per cent of the normal Morgan Stanley shares to $25.25, or is a amount of $3 billion.

"A week ago, he explained in Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that the participation had only been composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wished to reduce the risks and cover us. "
Based on the average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles a 7 % under its account value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential titles in regular actions within one year if they are sold by more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at $47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to cover investment opportunities, strengthen the balance and increase their liquidity.
However, a port of the group was refused to give exactions on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio animal One about 15%, one of the best sectors.
Morgan precisely had the balance of its balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausted for the group, which saw its quote in a shuttle down to half while the security costs against a risk of defects on its debt were delayed.
This cost was recovered last Monday, but it remained at a high level, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "persistent" of the major Wall Street investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' s slaughter and Merrill Lynch, announced that they had risen $15 million, partly to Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.

Letters - Mayoria silencies of culture
A debate on the financing of cultures makes smuggles and takes the current election campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will be risen to declare the miserable amounts that are granted to the small museums, the files, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that die from hunger?
What policy will the federal government be able to remember that his monuments and heritage buildings are disappointed?
Why don't we have true laws that actually keep our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Do you know that the French government dedicated three million and a half euros to restore only the Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the United States culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all government departments, and all this in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Quebec Federation of History Societys, at least 400,000 people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, files and genealogy are worried about searching in the history, maintaining with little money of private files and maintaining archaeological clothings.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, which protest with energy and dispersion when promotors and responsibilities launch their burdozers against our old stones and our forgotten cementarys.
For when, a monument for history and heritage?
Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The United States of the Netherlands - first in Europe - will assist with nationalization to the Forest Belgian and Dutch bank, which is seen as a result of the hypothetical crisis of the North America market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution as well as business in Hungary.
This weekend, the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have held a higher level of consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsible for the economic competition of the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first who has suffered the crisis of the euro area in the framework of the international financial crisis that is produced in more than one year ago in various oiled oils, so the decisions adopted on the Bank may, in certain sense, be considered as previous.
According to the decision adopted on Sunday's Sunday, the three States will buy about half (49 per cent) of the property of the Bank in their area.
The Bank, with all security, will sell a part of its business, including all the activities - primarily insurance-building in the last year of ABN Amró Dutch.
Fortis' actions began a strong decline last week, and for the second half of the week there were already significant crisis signs in the institution.
However, analists agree that with the 850,000 employees of this Bank is too large to enable them to disappear.
The company's actions so only on Thursday reduced 12 percent, and this is the lower point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions was decreased with more than two thirds.
Observing the current prices of actions, the total value of the market capital of the group is around 14 billion euros, but it is not real according to the company's executives.
The Directorate-General of the Bank imposed the fall of Fortis' actions to the insecurities of the North American market in relation to the adoption of the US package plan of $7,7 billion.
On Monday, actions have already shown a light increase.
On Wednesday, Philip Derrckx was appointed as the new director of the bank.
The Bank also searched for special investors, but until now no one gave a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the bank clients until now there was no panic, they didn't invade bank offices to retire their money.
The Fortis has his own sugar in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Smile in the gallery
In the United States, life and health insurance companies see the data of the medication purchase, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts are afraid that personal data markets are uncontrolled.
" There are personal data protection programmes, which are used for the use of receipt data in all cases for the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "We trust the gallineer to the ship" - quotes Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical receipt follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer health status and, if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to the medical control and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the control.
10 years ago Dick invented a very higher procedure: with the identification number of customers, the list of medicines purchased in the last and mid-year year and the program itself makes the conclusion on illnesses and health status of the customer.
For example, if you take a systemically large dose of pillars to reduce colesterol, indicates that blood fat level is almost high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some also set a number of risks, so the insurance company is only to do something, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
For example, some medicines are multiuse, for example, some substances serve both to treat head pain and warm bones and even antidepressives.
This last is a significant risk increased factor for insurance companies while the firsts are not.
Special companies were designed to consult and process these data, which requested the adoption of the patient before obtaining the necessary information from the medicines.
The authorities are already binding them to this, although they have not received much for the negligence of up to now.
Some companies have recently prepared the results of the laboratory reviews and assembling them with the consumption data, they have more specific information on the patient’s health status.
Each more company has access to these data, and simultaneously it is more difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but only for insurance companies and health services.
The draft law which provides right to the authority for the control of specialized enterprises for the supply of personal data is already before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is inadequate: therefore, he developed its program, which will require the specific approval of the person to provide his own personal data.
It is another question that this person cannot reject its approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
Thus, despite all the things, galls are exposed to the good will of the widow.
Global Menu of Marsella
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue, more than other global problems, has dominated the agenda of the nineteenth Summit.
Today will also be celebrated as a French-India Summit in order to address mainly the cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in developing that should have more voice and voting in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to reach a common designator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This question has not been addressed at the nineteenth Summit in Marsella yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the principal representative of the external policy, received Manmohan Singh, the first minister of India, which reached an agreement to double over five years, i.e., increased more than 100 million euros, its trade exchange.
As regards the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not excessively ambitious.
Thus, they legally harmonized the 20 bilateral civil aircraft conventions existing with India, so the air transport can also fly in the future.
In the end of 2009, India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is the balance, because while the EU is the first commercial partner of India, New Delhi is just the nineth place between the trade partners of the Union.
The Summit focused on global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of this last - and encouraging the convocation of the United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha's commercial liberalization round was also approved, although both parties have great responsibility in their failure.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be addressed, i.e., in 2020, wants to reduce pollution emissions at least 20 percent.
India is also agreed with this, as at the climate conference of the next year should be reached to a global agreement and decrease until 2050 with a 50 per cent of the production of gas that produces winter effect.
They also wish to prevent the increase in food prices and support the convocation of an international conference to overlook the financial crisis.
Today the government chief of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that French companies will receive charges for a value of twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

Find Steve Fossett's aircraft lost a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's aircraft, the Millennium Disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada wilderness.
The shoes have been found on a 3000 meter high level in the area of Mamoth Lakes Sera Nevada, in the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft, there was no human rest.
The Commissioner of Madera Council, John Anderson, has dismissed the doubts that remained: "The aircraft has been located, we sent a shield, and now we have confirmed that this is the case where Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," said in a stamping conference.
The Commissioner has indicated that there have been no human rests found in the aircraft or around.
The Millennium, 63 years of age, has been given for death in February.
The American Transport Security Office (Ntsb) has been informed that some hours after the rest's notice, a researcher school has been sent to the device: this is its own Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett dispatched from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Last night, always in California, not far from the Nevada Confederation, some of Fossett's personal rests have been found by a couple near the house of Mamoth Lakes.
This is two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of the Illinois, the money in effectiveness and one sugar.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after her disappearance.
The Millennium had been conquered a place in the history thanks to a wide series of primes.
In 2002, the sixth attempt was converted to the first Man to complete the world's round into an aircraft global: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later, the world turned on a planet and without scales.
Among their records, also that because he flyed at 15.445 meters above the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A Suv outside the schemes with a original and well established design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born between all "compact" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new window in this sector.
Proposed for the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will be accompanied with the launch of the Glk Suv, available in Mercedes-Benz exposure rooms since the next October 17.
The advertising campaign to accompany the debt of the new car launches an unreceived communication modality through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobilistic brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different stages, which would dominate the central street of the Milan shopping, advenished as, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special donations distributed in the advenida How can you see the new suv in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional format.
Effectly, looking at the image will be the impression that the car gets out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovated Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, to recommend in a single image.
Unlike doubts Mercedes with this advertising, you're trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of the automotive communication.
Can you get the interest of the future purchasers with this form?
is clear who are Italian hooligans
In the Tribune, the prohibition of access to sporting manifestations is stipulated.
But who are those 150-200 girls and girls whose Italia is now hungry? They are part of the "Other Italian" group that has continued for years and now, saying the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they never were found with the rival fanaters.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from the Trivenet.
De Verona, Patva, Trieste and Udine.
A small group of Sofia has been accompanied by the campaign and Apulia.
They have bands of three colors where the city of origin of the warriors appears: Saturday after night have been cut off so they are not identified.
The English fanaters are inspired.
In Bulgaria have found a group of real nazis fans, the Levski.
Figc had available 144 Italian fans for the party: all with the names, so easyly controlable.
And the minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had come out to Sophia there was no one with a Dapo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, no one who had banned him to frequencise a stadium.
Four Italian fanaters, who had previous crimes in stadiums, rejected the ticket and travel.
Now the Ministry of Inlands is expecting to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take steps: in this case, it is possible to give Dapo (prohibition of access to sports events) at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (interdiction of access to sports events) internationally that prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those of Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put more feet in a stadium.
Sure!
But now the fear of imitation is: that those few 50 are added to others.
"We have to immediately remove this fire and not legitimate those in this way," they supported the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Therefore, "good-open goes" in particular in view of the Monday National Party of Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultra Italy's supporters.
The Observatory is meeting tomorrow, on Tuesday, the Cams that can also contain with a section of the Aasis (Agence for Foreign Information and Security, i.e. the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The twenty-twenty-five colors and the slow arm during Mameli? In Bulgaria isn't a crime...".
This is the thinking of Domenica Mazzilli, a few weeks ago the director of the observation of the Ministry of Internal Ministry (he took the place that was previously from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was Chief of Trieste of Public Security where there was a nucleus of supporters from the Ultra Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that Bulgaria is not deceptive to celebrate the Twelve but if, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that have been angry.
"I do not do socialist – adds No. 1 of the Observatory – the crimes will be assigned in countries where the fact is happening.
Eventually, this group has been conducted well now, we will see what happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But we also talk about the silbidos to Mameli's hair: these are also not a crime, but if they don't allow them to be educational...".
