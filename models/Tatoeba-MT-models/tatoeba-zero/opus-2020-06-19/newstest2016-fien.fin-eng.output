Teacher admits his shooting girlfriend during the emergency phone
My voice is just a little bit of a color university student Shannon Lamb tells the police that he shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their home.
The Lamb emphasized that his "good dog" is alive and probably angry, and said that the closest contacts of women were found from this phone.
The police in the field found a message written to Amy Princess' body and to the hair page: "I'm so sorry that I could abolish this love Amya and she is the only woman that has ever loved me," said in the letter that experts are signed by Lambi.
Nothing mentioned that Lamb, who taught two network courses at the University of Minnesota Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 km from school camp, where the police believed that his shot and murdered historian teacher Ethan Schmidt, the door of this work room.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford told the university at 10:18 a.m.
He said to the Lambi's call a alarm call a few days later.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased, and the Lamb made self - murder when the police turned up.
The authorities still tried to find Lambi’s motivations on the day after students and staff were taken behind the doors hidden in the hidden.
Scientists both of the States have published information that showed students and staff to Lambia as a donor teacher, which may have a problem.
Students told them to wait for his feelings.
The police of Princess' death, Gautier, says that there were no violence in Lambi, no crime records.
Schmidt himself was included in the book to write to Lambi, in which he thanked "making people," with whom he shared his life of academy.
Both teaching society sciences and history institutions with a total of 17 members of the staff, and many students participated in the courses of each man.
On the other hand, there were some signs of the problem.
The student named Brandon Beavers was in the Lambie, but he said that he also seemed to be nervous and unpleasant, "no matters that anything had been in the sweet."
Another student Mikel Sykes told Lambi that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
The Lamb had previously asked the hospital from Delta State University to say that he had a health problem.
He just taught two network courses this year.
Recent changes in the principles of the university’s rewards mean that, although Lamb had worked very predominantly before his doctoral value, it did not give him automatical structural development and the department of the opening profile.
Professor William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was "speakly the Lambi's mind was something."
The Lamb can't answer these questions.
After the Lamb fled from the camp, the police went to his followers when he returned to Mississippi's state.
Before he was arrested, the Lamb shoot himself in a .38-caliper fleet in a house behind about eight and a half miles south of the house of his parents in Mississippi Greenville’s former city, reported by the University of Washington, Methel Johnson.
Lambin's car was still in the kitchen.
It was not soon clear why the Lamb was just going to this house, although Johnson said to believe that the Lamb knew the people living there.
The Lamb was in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geographic and educational information. At the University, there are 3500 students and it is in a city where about 120,000 people live.
The Lamb carried out a doctor's study in the educational science with a smooth snake.
One of the old Lambi’s friends described her as intelligent, charistical and fun.
Carla Hairston told her 15-year-old and Lamb's 20-year-old age when they met the communal friends.
Hairston’s friends were in the class, and Lamb was pleasant, older boy who tried to teach Hairston to call a blue for many years.
She was so sweet in those days.
All the girls were shut up when she was there, now telling the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives at Jackson's former city in Brandon.
The Lamb and Princess, of course, were shocking some time.
The Lamb told her murdered wife, but their marriage association has no evidence.
They were called Lightning's dog, who lived with them in the Gautier account.
The police told the dog's okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'St, told them a divorce 15 years ago, but I stayed as a friend, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really funny," O'St described her daughter.
He was his best friend.
O'Sten told you didn't meet Lambi, but she had heard her daughter Abigail that the Lamb had interested in music and called blue.
The Lamb met Princess when Lamb and Abigail were both in the summer market three years ago.
Afterward, they're playing together in some weeks.
O'Sten told her daughter to do and sing his own music.
Princess was a hospital who worked for a number of different network companies.
The Julep Rome's bar near Gautier, a marvelous bar, and a swimming chairman Mike Shaffer said he saw the Lambin and Princess last night when the Lamb had stopped his bicycle and swimming reporting.
There's nothing that seemed to be sweet.
"I'm a happy couple," he said.
We've played, and we shooted to each other.
So they were both very nice.
Dead teacher Schmidt conducted the seminar program of students in the first year and was specialized in Indians and the history of transferring periods, told the English teacher Don Allan Mitchell of the school.
Schmidt was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University of the United Nations, as well as the director of his brotherhood and the Administrative Office.
On the evening in Cleveland, the Delta States camp held a single camp which participated in about 900 people, including educational and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the messenger, which during the university's shoes, Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Learning continues in the middle week.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
Your crisis is over.
It's time to get up.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported about Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Petus from Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
According to the fact that the police now say the Lambi's emergency call after the shot of Schmidt, and that the Lamb was referring to his wife of Princess, there are no evidence that they were married.

The Chairman of the United Nations says that the situation of Syria is not armedly resolved
The answer by Mr Ban Ki-moon is that Russia's military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "Don't solve a weapon", and more weapons will only increase violence and millions of people's suffering.
The Chairman of the United Nations reiterates all parties, including the shared United Nations Security Council, to combine and support any undiscriminate negotiations to find political solution.
In the middle-week newspaper, Ban reported that he would like to meet five permanent Member States, the United States, Russia, China, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the General Assembly, and the French, later in this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the digestness of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional power factors "I did not resolve the situation".
The Bank called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis in view of solidarity and harmonity that they had shown when agreed with the Iran nuclear programme.
8 Assessment results show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to smell her as a winter.
Others just like him as a joke.
Sometimes you're waiting for robbery.
Although some Republicans have tried to shoot Donald Trumpi from the slaughter of counts, it has not been successful.
On the last 11th national question, Donald Trump has been due to the two-number chapter, and some have severely understood what this means for the appointment of the Communities.
It's just in the first stage.
These results still do not mean that Trump probably would be the candidate of the Republicns.
The comments noted that in this stage, Rick Perry had lost her leadership in 2011 to Herman Cain, which did not have to make any State in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he had problems in general.
However, foreign groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth have marked the synthesis of Trump and have started to use care for his disappearance.
The following recent stimulation results refer to the fact that the Communities are not only a unique stage:
The recommendation numbers of Trump have been completed.
Just before Donald Trump announced its emotion in June, Monmouth University’s advisory statements showed that only two ten Republica were positively related to the counterparty gas.
By July, the number was 40 per cent.
It was 52 per cent in the beginning of May.
At this time, six of the ten Republicns are welcomed to Donald Trumpi.
About three decades say they're denied.
These chapters also consider their place in the first pre-agency States.
In the university of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week 60 percent of the Republicans reported that they are positive to Trump.
Two third parts of the Republic of the Republic would be satisfied if Trump was a candidate.
In the last week in the question of CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicns said that they would be "fellowships" or "pleasant", if Trump was a candidate.
Only two decades said they'd be "trained" if he'd be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is divided into the same level as Trump (43 per cent of the "successful" vs. Trump 40 per cent).
The next cause of the most exciting joy?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 % of the representatives of the Republic would be "unpleasant" or "unpleased", if the preference for the governments of Jeb Bush should be a candidate.
Trump's fire is not a problem for the majority of the Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpi has been critically extensive of his potential talks and injuries, the ABC News/Washington Post question has been of 52 per cent of the voters on the national level of the Republic of the Republic, it is believed that the counterparty has an appropriate quality for the President.
According to the last week of Quinnipiacin survey, the number of Iowa State organized by the First Party Committee is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans believes that Trump has a suitable quality for the leader.
However, 44 per cent of the question of the ABC/Post considers that his nature is not applicable to the President, and nearly six ten of them agree that it does not belong to the White House.
The representatives of the Republic are taking into consideration.
When the Republicans consider as commentators, they agree that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four decades were likely as a option if Trumpia would be asked, who would be designated as the candidate of the Republics.
On the end of July, four decades represented Jeb Bushi.
Publication of data: The voters of the Republican Party have not always been able to use a crystal ball.
In this past period, four ten Republicns agreed that Rick Perry was appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final condition, Mitt Romney.
In each case, the majority of the voters of the Republican Party is to be believed by the Trump campaign.
Though the Republicans would reside in support of other candidates, Trump would still win almost everybody.
Some commentators have noted that the circle field probably has promoted the leadership of Trump, since the adverse encouragement of Trump has been shared between several other candidates.
However, the question undertaken at the beginning of September of Monmouth University showed that the hypothetical secondary kit of Trump and nearly all other republicans, Trump will be supported almost in all cases.
He leaders Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walkeria 15 points, Jeb Bushia 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie every 33 points.
He's on the point with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set up against, Ben Carson would win the businessman in the big 18-point part of Trump.
Right and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told the decision.
The new CBS/NYT question shows that only a few more than half of the voters who voted to Trumpia have decided whose voice goes.
Your situation can, of course, change, and no one can completely say that he would never change.
46% reported that they may be able to change candidates.
In any case, the biggest competitor of Trump now has a second inevitable victor, neurochirurgi Ben Carson, but those voters who said that they did the decision are probably two times on the side of the Trump.
Of the six ten republicaries, they're talking about the same agreement with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called mexican immigrants as a "fatal" telephone of the campaign, immigration has been in the middle of the debate in 2016.
Some are concerned that the possibility of Trump's translators to run from the farest Republicans and to harm rebuilding enterprises.
According to the new ABC/Post-skie survey published on Sunday, six of the six decades of the Republic states that Trump agrees with the same regard for immigration issues.
So it affects that as long as immigration is in the midst of matters, it's also Donald Trump.
The smoothing of the government has been upset by a new stage.
The encouragement of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the republicans, which is a large part of their position outside their policy.
Of the six ten Republicns on the country, ABC/Postky, said that they prefer to select an external policy person than a person with a government trial.
They're also hungry to the government of the Union.
Two weeks later, the investigation of De Moines Register/Bloombergin on Iowa showed that three four yowa Republicans were disfellowshipped in the Republic of the Congress: 54 per cent is "unpleasant" and 21 per cent of "real enemy".
The priority of Jeremy Corbyn by the Chief Minister
Corbyn's primary question has been gladly expected since his choice.
The new leader Jeremy Corby at the Labour Working Party will meet David Cameron at the first time.
The Corbyn is going to ask for the first three questions after a little half day, and probably both the media and the unemployed persons were fully able to control his implementation.
Corbyn has requested this weekly display for "The worst theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave part of the opportunity to handle his colleagues.
This approach is the first parliamentary test to the leadership of Corbyn when he was appointed to the guard government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre of Interactions.
At the same time, the decision by the Director of the Working Party on a silence during the national sing in the Memorial Service held in the 75th anniversary of the Britannican Aviation, has risen on the views of the conservative parties in the couples of peoples and have occurred in several prior cases.
Corbyn's decision not to be sing a national sweet has been aware of the attention.
The representative of Corbyn said to his "this is honourablely quiet" and that he recognizes "the sport of the aircraft in Ison-Britannia in the air war".
The Corbyn Administrator Owen Smith said to the BBC 2 Newsnight programme that he would have encouraged the Director of the Working Party to sing a national song, despite his thinking that the Kingdom Room should be delayed.
Nevertheless, the ministers of Warden have refused to join in Corbyn's internal barriers with the differences in the economic, defence and external affairs, and the sixth part of the parliamentary Party has supported him as a director.
The BBC Policy, Robin Brant, states that the position of the co-scale users in the European Union and the government's support chain have been "defeated" in the working group after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Interactions that the working partner will propose a change that would remove the whole disappearance.
Another time later, Mr Smith, Director of the Administration, Mrs Smith, said that the party was "a clear" in respect of the fact that they only opposed the plans of the government to count up to 26 000 trees from 23 0000 pounds.
Corbyn's five director of the Working Party, whose David Cameron has been paragraphed during the last decade, in which he has been the director of the Conservation Party.
The Director of the Working Party has promised a new approach to the policy and now tells us that he has struggled the ideas for the Prime Minister and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, the Popular Deputy of the Northern region, has said that the Prime Minister's question is too contrary to and that he wants to arrest as well as the smooth word and the smiling, instead of confronting serious matters such as poverty, differences and challenges of youth.
Corbyn has said that the Ombudsman's Ombudsman Angela Eagle works on his position when Corbyn doesn't participate, for example when Cameron is outside.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to use talks, and he has said his approach to the President of the Headquarters, John Bercowia, the team.
When Cameron arrived in 2005, he said that he wants to move far from a political theater, which is often combined to the questionnaires of the Prime Minister, but later he had to admit its failure.
Since they were launched to television in 1990, the principal minister's question was an important measure to evaluate the ability of the director, the management of his sector rooms, and the position of his position in other peoples, although the valuers have criticized the fact that they had been only a slight picture that requires great reforms.

The value of the powder is increased in the wage of the UK
The value of the powder slowed down after the numbers appeared to be increased in the britannic growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100-index increased the offering of SABMller.
During May and July, the payment of the United Kingdom, including the bonus, increased 2.9% compared to the same time in the last year.
The growth was fast after 2009, and it was considered to assess the increase in the rates.
The point increased over the percentage of $1,5505 and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed 1.49 per cent to read 6229.21.
SABMller was a separate market share and increased 20 % after the competitor AB Inbev approached it.
The agreement would combine two large world panics and twice together, such as Budshair, Stella Artois, Aberni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased 0.9 per cent after the competitive flowing group from Richmont was encouraged.
The newest sellers of Richemont were expected to be better, and in addition, they showed that the sales in China, which is the key market of Burberry, were starting to grow again.
The Glencore shares increased 5% after the cowboy reported that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating the shares on the movement of the shares.
Package and paper Group Mond shares were the largest independence indexed by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the "very".
JD Sports increased 3,1 per cent after the sporting company publicly informed its production of a half year before taxes: 83 per cent of the rates of 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports Company, the higher payment may harm the expansion
JD Sports Company director Peter Cowgill says that if the minimum payment of employees is higher in the British Island, it may mean that "potental consumers' purchase power is growing".
However, this purchase power probably does not exceed higher working costs for the company, it states Cowgill.
The costs could be addressed to the expansion plans of the company, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grain-freeding campaign against Ald's struggle
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trade in Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
In order to defend the market share of IGA tradeers in South and West Australia, Metcash has started to counteract the foodstuffering campaign in order to defend the market share of the IGA trade in South and Western Australia before the attack of Aldin $700 million.
At the same time, Aldi is prepared for the opening of two departments as well as for the first year in South and Western Australia, which has been reached by 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets establish their relationships with local coal intermediaries and build the IGA bridges through the market of power and social media and events, such as the Adelaide show show.
The trades and purchasers of IGA have been delayed, and the burns such as the refrigerators from Dunsborough offered massives in IGA trades, and the owners of the owners sell a decrease prices for the fighting of the shooter of Australian football customers.
The Metkashi is expected to provide more details on its Defence Strategy on 29 September when this food, alcohol and rail tabagment sales will organize the yearly strategy of investors.
There are many games, since nearly 30 per cent of the IGA trade in Metkashi and the production margins are higher than the IGA network of the East Metkashi states.
The purchasers of South and Western Australia are apparently well-known, and IGA revengeers have much greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% of the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi is taking about 5% of these two states’ foodstuff markets in 12 months after the opening of the first movements.
In its report, Morgan Stanley's analysis, Tom Kierath estimates that the IGA revengeers can lose $360 million per year in sales and Metcash can lose 250 million to the end of 2016.
This prophecy is based on the default that Aldi will open the next year in the south of the 25th and west 30, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and measurements of the higher costs of Metcash can be paid to Metcash about 13 million dollars of trafficking infringements before the height and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in the older states, mainly Ald and Coles, although in the study of Roy Morgan, it was said that IGA customers were all the most faithful ones.
Morgan Stanley believes that the Metkashi food and food sale is 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share is 14% from 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said in the business in Melbourne, that Metcash can "also likely be removed in decades".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it was understood that the member of the Metkashi government would have taken contact to Douglassis last week.
The market share of IGA has been estimated from 18 per cent to 14 per cent after 2010, and the production of Metkash food and food rights, which covers products for 1200 IGA sales, has been estimated to 43 per cent after 2012.
However, it has been invested in more than 150 million dollars annually during the latest of hundreds of products at the same level with Coles and Woolworths, while helping vendors of IGA to make the sales more rapidly increased food, and in the market the best private signs of the market.
Mrs Ian Morrise said that the rate of prices and the increase in sales has increased the strength of the prices, and he hopes that the smoke sales will return to the growth of the products in 2017, first into the fourth year.
President Steve Healy, Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Cokkinaks
Thanasi Kokkinakis offers more honor than its critical practice
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been able to suffer in a recent shock that has shocked his friends around Nick Kyrgios. He gives the honor more honor than his own critical conduct, says President Steve Healy, Australian Tennis Association.
The "Special Ks" named a two-year-old young member Kokkinakis, unless he wants the public case in which Kyrgios doctored Stan Wawrinkaa Montreal Masters.
Shortly after this invasion in Cincinnat, the chief court had two times to remove Kokkinaks and his opposer Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan had to defeat Kyrgios, and I should shoot that shooting."
Even though Kokinnakis was finally seen by shooting his mail after his possible victory from Richard Gasquet in the United States open, Healy was an uncarcerable defender of Kokkinaks.
Right now, young man is in Glasgow in the competition with Sam Groth on another place in Bernard Tomici with Davids Cupin in the semi-final of Britain.
"I'm so strong that Thanasi has been only shooted with its skin," Healy said.
He wasn't the first player who destroyed his mail because of the crampe in the United States open, but he's not the first player who ruins his mail when he's broken, and I'm aware of Thanas enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has been a great well-being, also in a very tricky situation in the United States in Open Harrison, and in this way, and I think he's able to win hers.
He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's got a little angry.
He's a very sweet 19-year-old, he works hardly, including the team, and so still, and he has never had problems with other players. He's estimated in the bathroom, he's slowly practiced, is good, and especially is a peaceful and skilled young man, and I think that he should be evaluated according to his anxieties.
Healy has also encouraged the decision to be not taken from Kyrgyzstan, according to the most important games on Thursday, to describe this "community decision" for all good solutions, but I still support Canberra's return to a stable team.
"We want to be fully concentrated on the games and not all the polymics [Kyrgios] around", said Healy.
And Nick has really been so fast, as, for example, Federer and Murray have been observed, and he has been grown in public, and has made some challenging errors and gains all its criticism, but we are trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his work, and I believe it is the best and the team, and if he brings some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European Immigration Crisis: Hungary announces the emergency account, closes the borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary proclaimed an exception and closed its southern border by arresting those who tried to go unlawfully in the land, but the goal is to cast the voice of the future migrants into the country.
The king followed the caos when hundreds of migrants gathered into the unfair region, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a smooth.
People who run for violence in their homes have now been able to switch and have set indefinitely between two controls of the country.
However, the deterioration increased.
The police's helicopter remained above them, the immigrants cut "Open the border!" and smile the damages of the Hungary Melanchopolis.
Some refused to protest food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable to accept" the return of the migrants from Hungary, when they reached more than the Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be a part of the solution, does not cause a threat to civilians.
The debate must be close to the other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Praha.
The board between the Hungary and Serbian border was born after the 28th group of nationality failed to create a common immigration policy in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed with the same responsibilities for 40,000 safe places for persons who are now reserved to Italy and Greece, which are desperately talking about the final agreement, in the first month or at the end of the first year, of which the EU has taken 1200,000 additional places, including part of the Hungary.
The German Alliance Officer Angela Merkel and Austria require the next week of the EU Summit, which is discussed on the migration crisis of the country.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or Brussels acted in the next days.
On the other hand, the emergency situation in two Southern regions gave the authorities more power to operate in crisis and the possibility that you can close and safeguard duties can be speeded.
At the same time, Peter Ssijarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that now when the Serbian border is ready, the country will also be able to make a part of the swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming pool against the Romanian border to stop the land of immigrants.
CBS NewsīCharlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been disfellowshipped in order to swallow the swimming currency between Hungary and Serbian.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest shock and arrival place for refugees in the European Union, which many are going to fight against Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban has stated that the majority of the arrival arrives is the better life of refugees in searching for a better life, and not the low-border refugees that are justified to protect - this view is strongly contradicting other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that arrived in the middle of the night in Hungary are now defined as a crime to exceed or damage the firm from 4 meters (13 feet) swimming pools, which has built the government towards the southern border of Serbian, and contain the higher prison expansions for human traffickers sentenced.
The Government's reporter Zoltan Kovacs reported to the journalists in South Szeged, because “the situation caused an immigration change”.
We are very clear in this: the overwhelming of the border of the Office is a crime.
The Parliament has still to adopt formally a war position expected for the next week, but the Associated Press providers have already seen a weak armed military personnel for vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, home security advisor, said that the authorities had taken 45 persons by trying to overcome their borders, as well as 15 more closer to the country.
They are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of the crimes defined in new laws.
The authorities will soon correct the aid.
The Hungary officials also closed two of the seven supervision sites from the side of Serbia after they sent one of these places on the slopes.
The main border site near Hungary Roszke was cut into the cake when the Hungarians opened a small office of metallics for human processing, and the population groups tried to enter.
Some 20 got inside, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbian and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Various: National investigation reported by Hillary Clinton, director of Bernie Sanders, has been shocked on the side
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton continues in a two-number democratic board, but Senator Bernie Sanders circled him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of democratic voters (58 per cent) and the second Sandersia supports 27 per cent (reduced from 17 per cent).
The President Joe Bden has not yet reported whether he goes with his president, but it supports 15 per cent of the voters of the Democratics.
Over five months before the beginning of the exiles, the majority of democratic democratics states that it is still too early to say that they would have decided to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choices more closer than other candidates.
Clinton's recommendation has been calculated in several groups last month after the CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders have increased some comparison.
Clinton's strongly leading to women and malicious couples, but his leadership has fallen.
His appeal has been significantly calculated in the couple of men, and Sanders have only 5 percent of the remaining units.
Clinton's prior interest in democratics under 50 years has lost, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading to the couple of parents’ voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-number couple of liberals, but now Sanders lead to this group with five percentage units.
About half of the democrats of the country say they support Clintonia with enthusiasm if he is a candidate to defend.
The fourth says he supported him, of course, and 15 percent had helped him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't help him anymore.
It is not very surprised that Clinton's current supporters are likely very encouraging in his support.
The men are more grateful with those who aren't in this moment to make Clintonia just the fourth helped him.
In which 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they were encouraging Clintonia, the one of the Republicns of Donald Trump said the same rare Republican representative (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in the open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the recommended answer was that he had a suitable experience (16 per cent), and then the most recommended answers were that there is now the right time for the President of the women (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate to the task (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also reported his connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Similar opinions and possibility to be selected were also mentioned.
Since the President affects the possibility of the Presidency, 57% of the democratic representatives would like to see him in a kitchen, although the third is different.
The question of democratic representatives who have chosen to be a second party, Bden is the most recommended choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half says they chose Biden, which is much more favourable than Sanders.
If Bden decides to be able to go without the condition of democratics, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will grow. If B's coming, the lead is 20 percent units, but if he leaves, chapter 30 is.
55% of the democrats consider that Clinton has the best opportunity to win the presidential counts, but this number has been calculated by 78% last month.
By this measure Bden remains far, but the percentage of those who hold him as voters has grown.
However, when democratic voters asked what is the main candidate, they highlighted the opinions for voteability.
Any democratic candidate or possible candidate has not been considered impossible for these voters in the last month.
The candidates of the Democratics or the potential candidates are very good in certain keys among their voters.
The majority of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
B's all right in the best honestity, when Clinton's strength is the lead.
30% of democratic employees say that Clintone does not be honest and reliable, which is two times more than Sanders (15%), but 27% say that they do not have the opinion of Sanders.
Democrats also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically the same agreement.
When we look at all these points, about the fourth democratic voters say they have no idea of Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and service as a foreign minister continues to raise questions, the majority of the democratics are satisfied to explain the matter and says that the matter has not affected their generality.
However, it is another thing when we look at the Americ as a whole.
The pools of the Americans are now unpleasant to explain him, and only about a third part is satisfied.
The views of the nation were divided in March early after the issue comes to a disappearance.
Most Americans say that the e-mail policy did not affect their totality of Clinton, although 36 per cent of them say that their opinion has been bad.
Before six of the ten Republicans say that their opinions from Clinton have been worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own defendants are to be honest and reliable to him, this is still a problem among all registered voters, but only 32 per cent of it is to be honest and reliable, and this number has been calculated by 8 per cent units last month and 15 per cent after May.
62% of the registered voters say that Clintone is not to be honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the voters in the whole country also do not consider Trumpi honest and reliable.
But Clinton and Trumpi are considered a good leader.
The new candidates of Biden, Carson and Bushi are more honest.
Sandersia is considered to be regularly honest, but many have no opinion of him, just as not Carson.
There are 6 per cent units in the investigation in which 351 democratic voter participated.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trumpi in national question
Ben Carson will come near Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times question
Two candidates were collected in the new question of half of all the voices, leaving others to fight the passenger.
The representatives of the Republic are still strongly supported by the country by Trumpia, which has been encouraged to increase the question of the CBS published in Fox News as a 23 per cent from the question published in the last month.
However, in the same time, Carson increased from two percent to 23 percent.
The question was also observed that Carson was very good in the couple of different demographic groups and is being excluded by the high-educated Republicans of Trump.
The final fields have remained, unlike Carly Fiorina and Ohion head John Kasichi. The encouragement of the Visconsin Scott Walker has been the largest: from 10% to the current 2% last month.
The former Flood Secretary Jeb Bush, the former Archansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, are on the third level in the third place of 6 percent.
Error marginal in the heading of the 376 Republican voter under this new, in September, is +/-6 %.
Last week, published by the CNN/ORC question, Carson showed that he had 19% of the encouragement in the Republicns, and Trump is at 32% before him.
The newest ABC News/Washington Post asked also Trump was significantly above Carsone.
Carson's recommendation on the last week, Trump criticized the remaining neurochirurg, even though Carso asked for forgive the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," Trump said last Sunday, his campsite in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of the first year of the student of Baruch College.
About two years after a student died in the smuggle of the brotherhood in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder has been raised against five people.
In September 2013, the members of the New York City Balch College membership Pi Delta Psi were sentenced to Chun "Michael" Denig's membership in September 2013, and then moved to his hospital when he carried out, so later effects on his death, the police found.
The authorities say that Denig's eyes were shocked and then shooted over 13-kill shoes, and then he was repeatedly shocked into the land when he tried to walk on the left game towards the land.
Finally, Deng decided that his head was shocked, and then she lost his mind.
The brother’s members did not call the emergency number from Denig, but, according to the accused, they waited for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police says.
However, they had time to change the clothes of Denig, search for information on their symptoms, and to contact the President of the brothership with Andy Mitch asking that advice, the police chief Chris Wagner reported in the press.
“It was the case, members began to hide their ritual resources and therefore, in practice, put the brother's welfare to Michael Denig,” said the chief Wagner.
Deng couldn't get to the office, and she died next morning.
According to the Deng protocol of the body, shocks in the head, guards and shocks were repeated.
"A lot of families have been able to suffer from the brotherhood, when at least one student has died since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer represented the Dengin family, in his statement.
The brotherships and their members must be responsible, and the step of these authorities is important.
The large cluster of Monroe's district was part of the fact that the first five members were accused of the murder of the third position.
32 Other members of the brothers, including Me, are also condemned by violence and criminal drinking.
"We don't want to be responsible only for individuals, but if there is an organization which has accepted the situation or officially or not, they should also be responsible," Wagner stated in the press.
Burch College spoke to the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood, contacted the local office.
This happens when the US Central Bank increases the rate
The expenditure will be, and the markets of the increased rates fall, the production of debt papers will increase and the economy will be declined.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going or how long it's going on.
The past does not just give help in terms of the schedule, which will be named in the economy.
The income has been held after the first income at times only 11 months, sometimes again has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank has been often, although not always, to determine how the economic and financial resources reacted.
As a result, the officials of the United States Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investmentrs should not be focused on it because higher rates are reduced, but closely to normalization of the situation in the development gases.
Indeed, there are several changes.
However, finally, the market shares may find that all counter-related rates have been exceededed.
"Indeed, after the first global economic crisis of the Central Bank, the main report on the global issues of Julia Jessop in the communication to customers is unnecessary.
Instead, we are not expecting that the United States' rates will return to normal, even though still low, but the level is such an incredible sense that many feel that they are afraid.
However, this does not mean whether it does not affect it.
There is a view to how some economic parts of the regions will react on the basis of an early development:
As the market has been seen in the last few months, the expectation of the impact may make the situation unfortunately.
When the emphasis is true, the effect is not exactly so dramatic.
"Declares that the capital product has a tendency to stop on 12-24 months after the first reiteration, which may be reflected again in the monetary policy," the German bank analysts said in this investigation on what happens after the rating of the Central Bank.
In fact, the markets are generally strong in the last 35 years, at about 14% when the approach is highlighted, 250 days later, the situation is very balanced (the average increase of 2.6%) and the normal state has been reached by 500 days after the average product in two last cycles in 14.4%, is reported in the analysis of Bob Doll, which was published in the newspaper of Barron.
According to the German Bank, the impact on the shares is usually clearer at the latest stage of the highlight cycle when the products start.
Many are part of the economic life, but the rates often promote them.
In the present situation, the Central Bank has a number of challenges that have not previously been and which can slow up the back.
This is in particular a bruto population product that will be closer to the level of all times before the Central Bank's incentive.
According to the German Bank, the number of GDPs in the 118 decreased since 1950 had only been less than 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3,6 %, it is rarely believed that it remains when the third fourth has been advanced by 1.5%, reports the Atlantic Federation Bank.
The expenditure of the costs in the budgetary seat may be risking and urge a question of "is this one different", German Bank stated.
The market shares have been funded to highlight the Central Bank throughout the year, and all will wait for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will be finished in the tour.
Although many strategies and economic advisers believe that the Committee can accept the emphasis on this meeting, the future trade is only 25% of the probability.
"We have shown that since 1950, all the highlight cycling cycles have reiterately occurred in the supersykls, with the BKT's highlighting higher upwards very quickly after the start of breathing", reports.
On the contrary now, there was an exceptionally long-term delay that has been the worst of the time of observation.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has been expecting to have overwhelmed the end of the last round for 35 months, and now it has already been 74 months.
It has also been insufficient when expected that the markets were insufficient, and the model reminds some considerations made in comparison with the capital.
It is mainly that when the Central Bank changes its lines, its effects appear to be faster in the obligation document than in the shares.
The direction of the products of the cycles appears to be immediately changed in the first highlighting/related cycle.
At the end of the recovery cycle, the product of debt documents is immediately calculated," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab Strategy believes that the rate of higher prices causes the slower and shorter prices of the slower and thus the product use.
High-produced bond books often produce better in such situations, although "we are, however, careful for the search of products", stated an analysis of the frozen product in Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Incrediblely, Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to the line outputs of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the cost of the Dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the markets have adjusted the more slightly financial policy visions", he wrote.
The short-term rates are higher, the product is more balanced, the credit margins have grown and the insecurity has grown - all these are characteristic on the market when the Central Bank has slowed its line.
Generally, undertakings with undertakings in the capital to the United States will win when higher rates are increased and local products are more attractive.
Multinational enterprises who have lots are worse when the value of the dollar increases their products in the world markets and their prices will be more than what they have.
"The history shows that the 'deadants' instruments are usually the most productive after three months of the first highlight", analysts of Goldman Sachs performed in their report on customers.
Enterprises with a strong trade change had a weak business exchange undertakings in 1994, 1999 and 2004 after a average of five percentage units.
Enterprises with high capital production and low volatile shares were better performed than low-quality companies. Firstly, the average values were 4 (percentage units) and 3 (percentage units).
The brother's going to be a big problem.
Those who have a lot of switch costs are lost most, Goldman said.
There is also the possibility of consumers to benefit from the increase of the value of the dollar.
The legislators can also win the latter results, although the experts are different of how rapid the effects are.
BBC Radio is copy of Classic FM, mediator Andrew Bingham says
Conservative citizen Andrew Bingham accused of the channel of civilization.
He claims that the distinction of the commercial competitor is still more difficult
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards money, saying that they only go to British Awards money
National College Damien Collins criticizes The Voicea saying that it isn't own
BBC Radio 3 is "more" as Classic FM, declares the pressure of the increased production company in the production company that it makes something that commercial production companies do not do.
The conservative citizen Andrew Bingham also said to BBC's leaders that the radio channel of public service affects the content of the "national" and that it is still more difficult to differ from the commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "Clasic FM", he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards loan, which was launched last December.
"BBC Music Awards started last year only affects different names from the organized British Awards Gale.
So if you're trying to do something different, this is two examples that I'm right to remember when in itself you just copy something that you're already finding from the market," Bingham said.
The Chairman of the BBC urged the accused that BBC Radio 3 is a lot of business packaging to share life music and information to the citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things from classic music that I can't learn from anything else.
Its commitment to living music and music is in itself the primary class.
"Anyway, I think it's really important that Radio 3 has committed to find a new music and to place new things," he said.
Previously, this year, Alan Davey, head of the BBC Radio 3 stated that the channel must do more work than for the purpose of the public, as the Britishs know less about classic music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the provider of BBC that criticizes the funds of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Cultural, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory partner Damien Collins criticized The Voicea, a musical competitor whose BBC purchased from the Hollandic production company from Talpa Media by 22 million reds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it isn't original, and it's not a custom?
Lordi Hall stated that this BBC1 canadian program, which operates as Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced in the "BBC style".
He adds that he wants the producer company "the success that is found inside his own house" next time it starts a reward.
However, he has not agreed to prevent the production of the future The Voice times, or to determine that money would be used for other forms of relief.
On August, Black Friday may have been reasonable
Network sale increased 7 % in 2015 in the first three months
In the last month, the increase has been increased after the start of the lower statistics in 2000.
3 years ago the network sale confirmed the use of mobile devices for purchase
Experts believe that Black Friday can smoke with consumption in November
The functions of the officials have rarely grown over ten years and have changed many of the buying citys in Britain.
However, experts say that there are marks on the level of net sales at the time when the latest figures showed only 7 per cent to the first year of 2015.
The total volume of Monday increased at least before the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five percent of the last year.
Experts say that there are marks on the level of the net sales, when the latest figures indicated only 7 per cent increased in 2015 at the first year of 2015.
"If the growth rates of the previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be raised later", said Andy Mulcahy, provider of JMRG marketing index, reported to Guardian.
He explained that three years ago the net sale was confirmed when the buyers began to use their mobile phones for buying.
This means that most people were buying online, and that they could be able to do in different environments, such as sweets.
But now it is leveld, and it can be calculated.
The Black Friday show from the United States has been held behind the long-term trade.
Experts believe that consumers are shocking the purchase work before the last spring of November.
Last year, the normal average value of five times more buyers paid to their computers to catch trade sites in many trade sites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who received the buyer to strike the findings, can hide the purchase work.
The British Retail Consortium, published in the British Retail Consortium, stated that only one of the five items were used online.
A number of products such as television and pessoms, more than third-party buyings are now made on network trade.
At the same time, more than fourty persons buy clothes and kits from the Internet, instead of using the purchased model chain.

The Meca is around the large mosquitoes, which are part of the great construction structure which is leading to the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arab government family for decades, leading to large construction projects.
The leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family was in the 1990s.
The Romanism was in an winter and swimming arrangement only days before millions of people arrive to the Kingdom for the sacredness of the Kingdom, which each Muslim is to do at least once in life.

The other assaulted ones get half of this.
B & Q-popular says that the workers working for Eastern European authorities are a favorite
The Britishs still use the services of helpers, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the growth
As a search for professionals, Screwfix sales are opened to 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q winters around the country

Laury said, "The biggest part of our sells is still men.
We need to get better balance.
However, the pools of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchasing decisions of the products are women.
Women have a great role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women leading to the most important firms of the British FTSE100 index, and he has rebuild its leading group, as it has a lot of men and women's groups.

The third Government decided to resolve the compulsory legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were made soon.
The decisive decision of the SAK and other NGOs began to impede the same step and, as a result, the country stands on Thursday afternoon because of the wide notice of employees.
Many think of the time, it is also a reason for it.
Let's ask if it supports the laws when it's going badly.
It is even found in the contradiction.
In the network, more than 500,000 people have already been reporting that they are not going to participate in the imagination but to work.
At the time of a good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net where protesting, but openly proclaiming richly would have been a small political suicide for humans.
Military professional organizations are not a lot of time protesting in thousands of people, but it gives it a reason for thinking.
The position of vocational interaction is no longer as clear as it has been for a couple of years ago.
Everyone does not know the goals of the movement to its own, values have changed
In view of the interestfulness of the work of the Ae movement, the restrictions of the government may also be a direct gift to the heavens.
When things have shown their own pressure for years, finally, in agreements, the rights of the employer to defend, visually and honestly.
The government may likely want to shut up the role of the cylindrical movement when the membership in the Professional Union is seeing the cases more necessary.
Whatever the organizations agree, it's not to say that the opinion on the birthday would stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has been stopped.
For example, industrial production has been calculated for 31 months.
Great people's production continues to reduce, and unemployment increases.
Well, you thought you had to spend all of these things.

At least transdev (ancient Veolia), which has so far bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe, has been informed of other international companies.
The United States Central Bank must decide on the rates
Another world will follow on the page when the United States Central Bank is assembled for two days in the middle of the week and struggle to make a critical decision whether they will raise higher rates for the first time for about ten years.
In Reuters' question, a few more than half of those who still believed that the Central Bank had been a higher rate last week, now believe that the situation is still not resolved and highlighted at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This has a historical event, because when your Central Bank operates up to zero, it is seven years.
The first time we are approaching the situation in which the central banks have the possibility to get out of null and start normalization of higher rates", said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute, senior fellow.
The United States economy has been relatively well, and the relief has produced $1 billion and a little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot take attention to less rare global views.
It has warned the markets that they should be prepared to be income, but it also shows that they believe that the likelihoods are highlighted.
The decision shall be published as a tour at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University's shooter left a forgive message
After the shot of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Wednesday, before he shot his colleagues after the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "devil" about the first murder and hoped that "to be able to shoot it," told the authorities in the way.
Mississippi's police reported that the teacher of Delta State University's geographical information and social sciences Lamb called an emergency number around ten mornings.
Wednesday, he told him he shot and killed someone.
The Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send the officers to his home.
He said "her wife's last night" and also said that in the house there's a "small dog," which "not hurt anyone," but it's likely angry.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell it.
The Lamb didn't explain the shoot.
When the police came to the place, there was 41 years of age, Amy Prentiss' body, and 45 years old, a message written by Lambi, which reads: "I'm so sorry I'm so sorry that I could pull it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me."
In writing, the message Lamb was about 500 miles [500 km] away from the Delta State where he killed a historic observer Ethan Schmidt, before finally killed himself as a late day after the police was drawn him.
Professor William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was "speakly the Lambi's mind was something."
The authorities said that, despite the statements published on Sunday, Lamb had believed that the Printis had been Schmidt, there was no "legal information or evidence" of any "true trimondrate".
Shawn O'Sten told her that he was married to Princess about seven years old and described her as a man.
A couple left 15 years ago, but he remained a friend.
O'Sten told him and Princess had a 19-year-old girl who had "trained".
O'Sten told that Princess and his daughter were "the best friends of their everyday time."
According to Linsday Knowles, Princess worked at his home online. Sun Herald says that he was a close friend of Princess.
Knowles said that Princess, who had a dog named Lightning, had been seen with Lambi for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," knowles said.
The police told the family to call Lambi to the family who had a call on the Sunday to tell them that "Don't go to prison."
When the police aimed at Lambi's Kingdom at 1st Greenville after the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the way, left it and went to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb claimed about the educational science of Delta States on Friday 2015, reports the list of the information found on the websites of the university.
Stars that lost their power of anxiety
The viewer (left), pictures with his son Redmond (right), has been angry over the last few years.
In 2001 he was sick, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to drugs, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested by drug management.
All such things really require their taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is outside months because of double destruction
Luke Shaw took two murders to the right legs of Manchester United in the fight of the Mediterranean.
Although the defender left in a shock and is at least six months outside, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be coming to play again in this time.
The Vamman triggered Hector Morenon in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old show was in the PSV region.
He was treated in 9 minutes in the field, and he was forced to give healing before the hospital was carried out.
Van Gaal said, "He has two murders in his feet, and he's in the hospital now."
She's gonna be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then we'll be cut in Manchester.
It's a horrible thing. The boy comes to Manchester as a 18-year-old age, suffering difficulties, and then plays magnificently, and now it's going to be.
When I was in the bedroom, he was on the hairman.
He cryed.
I'm not a doctor, but the two-year-old murder will take at least half years, and he's not playing in the slowest stage.
I hope he's coming to play this time.
Moro affected the happiness when he got or got a red card and a punishment.
Episode Nicola Rizzoli did not punish mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian employee was wrong.
You can judge the situation when I say that it was a punishment and a red card.
It's really bad two ways.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all your messages, thank you, the words are not enough to tell me how crazy I am, I'm coming back now, I'll come back as stronger."
As regards the question: Manchester United suffers on the case of Luke Shaw and losses PSV
The English Defence Defender has an additional capacity for engagement in European mastership competition in France next June.
PSV trainer Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad."
If a player gets out because of the worst, it's all very painful.
Our player's purpose is never a struggle against the opposite.
Moreno's leg struggled when he played a Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland in the 2014 MM schools.
"Moreno takes this weakly, because it is not intended to hurt the opposite, and when he hears that wealth is really bad, it's a bad thing," said Cocu.
I didn't see that in the situation.
The only thing that I saw was the pillar that was going to different directions, so he [Moreno] would have touched it, but I did not see Luke’s back.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know what it feels, I know how difficult this is.
I'm so sorry for this.
Andrés Watchdo was also transferred to the hospital with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know Lorax better about this?
Each parent has learned soon: If your child loves a book, don’t have a long time before he learned almost outside.
So just if you're David Cameron.
When the service offered to childhood was asked from the Prime Minister of his favorite book, he chose the history of the environmental protection published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on SuperCamps' company's websites in the public message and continues to say: "Free, touching, creating and contained strong message. I like to include this book to my children, because it is always feeling a image or message that we have never seen."
This is all true, but the next chapter, in which Cameron is unfortunately described by the book, is the efficacy of the 2012 film version, which has been added to the full of the very short original text of new depicts and details.
"In the city of Tarville, where all creatures have lost and even air is commercial goods, Ted's son hopes to gain his dreams in the heart of Audrey's hope to see the right tree," said and described a lovester who died Dr Seuss, the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, was not written in 1991.
If this is not sufficiently suspected, Cameron's text hears to the place as it had been taken by the Internet Movie Database Internet on the drinking of the Lorax photo that begins to: "In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is methodic and even air is commercial, the Ted son hopes to get his dreams on the side of the heart of the Audrey girl."
Bearing in mind that Cameron is publicly active parents, it is uncertain that he would be so unfair to drinking a book. There, the youth, the son of the name hears how the local nature has destroyed, the trees shocked and needed to kill Kerskane, without interesting in the story of a short name, was of Lorax, which was "the clean trees".
This relatively visible PR work is likely to be foreign assistant who has apparently never read a book 20 times from the child.
The Director of Directors said that the text was linked to Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's personality, but not commented on this moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger to stay on the page of the English team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan has a very task in the Arabians, but when you see what team the English team has chosen to turn around, I don't believe that the last 3-0 series is likely to be repeated.
I didn't close the guest from the counts.
The half of the Cook may have experienced less than a team over three years, but there is a strong way of thinking with good rounders and teams: they have no idea in 2012, just a youth positiveness.
Moeen Ali is developed in the surrounding work and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although it is unknown at this level.
Regarding the question: Adam Lyth slaughtered from the English critical team, his condition will come to Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is very difficult to analyze me because I am his headquarters in York.
His seven games have been good attackers in situations that could be deceived, and the simple but the truth is that critical players are appreciated on the basis of their results.
For example, no uncertainty was before the information, because, as I previously said, the players are the best factors for the choice.
About a hundred more points, and Lyth had been able to continue in the team, but he was responsible for his own goal.
I hope if he gets more walks to the Yorkshire, the second chance is to come forward.
The English chief trainer Trevor Bayliss had led to Lyth's position when he did not do so much as he could, and it wouldn't surprise me. Lyth is first of all the team player.
It's hard to answer the question how long the slaughter is going to leave.
Lyth was elected seven times in the country team, such as Sam Robson before him, once again Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the possibility of playing as well as home and visits.
The only subject of the complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trotti first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in the high school, but it is now the last time.
Alex Hales comes with me, and there's a shoe that I'm worth.
He has a cricket player of something that we had seen in the New York City in this time when he made 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must give at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this really depends on the meeting of the team in the Arab Middle East in the United States.
There was a shocked idea from Moen in the shooting shoot near Cooke, where the field could be extra feed, but four speeds could be held, and I don't have to do this.
I don't understand why the kids could shoot there, and this left-handed has already proved to be a very critical player.
It doesn't necessarily make her task in its creature in Worcestershir, but he's a third and there's no difference.
My old teamfriend Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first castle before moving to open in 2001.
He did three hundred points immediately and you didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be a slaughter of the team, and, the little thing I've been doing with him, he feels very affected by a young man.
Humans can look at his amazing statistics - with a ball of 31, with 35, and think that it is a threat, but there is no too much food and choices that have chosen young people.
He learned a lot in this round.
There are some hard additions from the trainer outside the UK.
The appointment of the Sri Lantern Mahela Jayawarden for consult games can be shown as a neuro-record.
He is one of the most pleasant friends of the game, and it combines a great number of experiences, because it has done everything in all situations and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be involved in the white ball games, and it brings together both energy and unregular disappearance.
I always thought that he was born to be together in the international cricket, then it was playing or training, and he has the same useful intellect as Mahel.
Sometimes the new voice in the shooting room can spend the teams, although their messages were the same as previously.
Colly's Aviation of Durha, Ben Stokes, will be shut up in one day, root was given the same shooting against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Even though all are not the same, trainers and elections do not make timetables.
And you must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions have never been made so much.
The support of the European Union (Brexits) may not be able to overcome if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-first renewal strategies to maintain British people from the day to the EU are still more problems, although it would not take into account even the heart Jeremy, “Isn't it?", the election of Corbyn to the Headquarters of the Centre for Employee or Employees in Europe.
Even foreigners have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatic curriculum explained, silently, that since the EU is in so deeply different crises, all of which is not its own reason, some Member States have made a very self-respective agenda in Britain, which is full of consents to divergences and adverse changes that these States do not want to be larger.
The Central Organization of Professional Interests in Britain decided that there is no desire to prevent social protection.
We couldn't call it Dave and George's self-related.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of State security shall delay the high-sessions or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, taking its own image before the local reminder mark or without her, and then come home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out in the EU-Brittanian Union - "Do not leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that the most shortest ministers and officers of certain capital cities are now in such a position that they do not care for staying away.
The German careful and moderate unions officer Angela Merkel is an alliance, but he has been in power for ten years and wants to leave his step before he goes to the pillar as it came to thatcher for too long (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohli (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a disabled power.
Poland may have a national legal government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries to sacrifice self-electrics when their energy would enhance their energy to prevent Scotlands from the source of the United Kingdom - they do not want it to be because of their own separation guidelines.
Thus, my friend presents that some of these ministers may even provide information on unnecessary comments on the style of the Skotlan National Party style in the Ison-Britannia in 2017 in order to accelerate the Brexit process.
"Review negotiations have been organized, and there was no meaning for the United Kingdom."
The Europeans have experienced how the Fleet Street newspaper will be and how the unique EU newspapers are, which were not inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, when our membership started in 1973 with the relationship 2.1.
They can swearly remember Boris Johnson, the largest European candidate, who made its own name by writeing the "the largest bananas of the EU" in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They were part of the booking figures of visitors, foreigners who had a chariot of telephones, as well as persons whose home is namely other than and who have the most grand part of our newspapers.
Tony Blair thinked of them at the same time, but he knew that if you're in a sweet gorge, the bananas have to be shocked because of the sweetness, if you want to be on the lunch of that gorge and later on the day.
Indeed, Miliband was more blair than Blair himself, which would be opposed to the renewal of Cameron's renewal.Bir had, on the basis of the EU-law abandoned, accepted by the French and Hungarian voters in 2005, thus given to Blair the situation.
The newspaper never let him forgive.
But the lovely Jeremy Corby, who met me friendly on the Westminster Parliament account (I told him that he has no longer time to condemn me) would seem to have a danger to repay the Mordoch Strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 80s.
Although it can take time, however, he must develop a coherent strategy to keep contact with the media. Not me, but doubtless, Andrew Marri, whose BBC Corby's advisory office has gone on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is beautifully developed and developed.
He said we would like to remain reformed in the EU.
Well, the largest part of the United Kingdom's self-defence partnership in the U.S. war into the U.S. Military Communities and the most disgraceful national forces of the Conservative Party can certainly be set on the basis of this view.
Hilary "Ben, but not Ben-fani," Ben said so in the radio and TV this week when his internal party would like to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint John McDonnell as a minister of State security.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father's television swimming up to the TV I tried to be unfaithful against his government partners without that it would go so long that it would lose his government.
Hilary's smuggling was more shocking.
But on the contrary, the fight that we're staying in "the situation where it's good" - the statement of Benin - was not what McDonnell said, and not all of the conclusions of what Corby told the heads and people in private meetings on Monday night.
Anything that is an inherent, sensitive and personal picture that Corby wants to discuss (remember that he is even about me), it is important for the curriculum of the communication during the period of round-earth television, and in particular in the social media orders that have an octile growth in persecution and pects.
As McDonnell has said, it is just the right to be not to give Cameron an expression to Europe by allowing him to support the working partnership in the people's vote campaign clearly.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn, based on the EU membership (and in line with their Benn's economy and their anti-kapitalist past), is no longer difficult to discuss in the couples of delegates whose low differences is the main dogma in channels.
With regard to his two-party, Tom Watson (Tom Watson has convinced that it is not a Corby campaign to resolve), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to its exemplary.
Why would Paris or Berlin support the reward of political capitals (anyone with inconsistent voters) granted to the United Kingdom when it may be totally angry?
The United States have already been struck by a weak military execution of the United States in Iraq, in Libya and Syria, even in the power of the reducing conservative government, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum for security.
Experts criticized the Public Health Electronics Rating of England
Researchers have said that the State financed Agency claims that electrical tuberculosis is less than the traditions, and that it was the start of 12 spirits in which there were contacts with the smoke industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts contacted the use of the certificate used by the Lancet Public Health of the Crisis (PHE) in their report.
PHE has published this "virus relief" report in the last month, which describes it "to be regarded as a two-by-case certificate."
However, many researchers have investigated the sustainability of information and referred to in contact with certain experts and the smoke industry.
Medical Medical Time Journal Lancet published in the last month a record which was rejected against the heading decision of the PHE.
Two more researchers written in BMJ have considered whether the arguments were "build for a ball or a skin."
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee, and professor of the University of Liverpool clinical epidemiology, Simon Capewell say: "The main principle of health is that functions must be based on evidenceful efficiency."
They say that the public expects that the PHE claims "the most typical urge of electrical taxes are at about 95% less harmful than traditional smokes" based on the detailed assessment and model of the certificate.
In fact, it will be a 12-style meeting with a multi-critical decision-making model (MCDA) to synchronize their views of the problems associated with different Nicotin products, and the results of this meeting were intensified in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, which the Director is informed of the financing previously received from the British American Tobacco company for an independent investigation.
He also supported the health capacity of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 meetings informed the financing of the manufacturer of the electrical tube, but not the financing that it was told before it would increase from Philip Morris International.
The elements of the selection of the members of the panel are not reported, but there are several known electrical supporters in the panel, including some of which reports about the financing in the field of the research.
Other sites have not been known for their expertise in the monitoring of smoke.
He also participated in the meeting by the Director of the PHE's Tuberculosis.
The research produced by the group "speakly recognised" is that there is a lack of "increased certificate in the most part of the products and most criteria", McKee and Capewell writes.
However, no such communications or restrictions shall be mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say the claims of PHE that "is no evidence that the electrical tuberculosis operates on the road to smoke with children or non-smoking."
Professor Kevin Fenton of PHE's health and well-being says that the claims submitted in BMJ have been answered previously.
He says, "Electronic accommodations are significantly less delicate than burning."
You're going to swallow your life, and you're gonna die in their dependence.
All proofs indicate that the health risks caused by electric smoke are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the certificate seems and what it does not appear, especially when the relative risks of smoke have so much public intelligence.
About 800,000 people die annually on smoking disease and smoking pay for NHS to $2 billion per year.
Explaining the current certificate material, namely, although electrical tuberculosis are not unreasonable, their deficiencies are only about the customs of the traditional tuberculosis, and we shall comply with our national responsibilities.
The BBC will support the end of EastEnders, says the former Championship 4
The former chairman Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "do anything" of such "also" slowly as in the street of Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license should only be used for programs that other members of the British mission are not doing.
It criticizes BBC that it will establish public service programs which probably have a smaller public publicity, difficulty against the competitors' programs and the channels as regards BBC4.
After the BBC's chief Tony Hall said to want to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson said he had home to Chanel 4: for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in a short way.
"I don't understand that BBC will produce and send programmes that clearly agreed to non-subventional competitors," Johnson said to the above room's communication committee as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the license is held - and I'm not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or for a long time - it should, at least, be limited to the production of programs that others do not and do it.
The Voicea is sent to the most important time of delivery, since it is intended to collect the most possible support.
The idea that nobody else would look at the programme is ridicule, it is ridicule, it is clearly higher.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why return tax should finance programs that could also be funded without State support.
The Voice is one such and the other EastEnders, without refused in the house.
The other channels, which I say, would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about the shipment of public service.
I don't believe that it's going to be weakening any BBC.
In the channel 4 of 2004-2010, a series of Johnson said that BBC is accused of the forests "for the purposes of people working in this area, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on BBC's most favourable series, remembering the comments of Tony Ballin's former director. He used its 2003 MacTaggart player in Edinburgh to suggest BBC's mixing series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smallest public public public services programs "involve BBC4, which is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but BBC will therefore comply with its responsibility area and may then be able to protect 4 billion of punctuary income, as a result of the fact that, "because we do all these unknown programs that no one looks".
They're putting them into a sending place where no one will never look at them.
I'd like to say to the Committee, "I'm looking for you to find the most back-up system on whoever receives the most opposite.
Of course, you all think, we're all thinking that 150 reds have much opposition in the year, but I don't know if it's the place for people who have 150 pounds of money, because they're not going to use the BBC.
The former director David Elstein, David Elstein, who also tested the committee as a stage, said that BBC should reevaluate its temporary task to "inform, training, and comfort".
He said that only a small part of the BBC production is now counted into education - he said that the numbers are 1% of the TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take a model of Australia and Canada's general radio and to change the mission to "inform, valuation and comfort".
What would be towards partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms-conserts, which, according to him, are shown in television only some people, and join with commercial companies so that all of these should be considered online.
"Sound genetics" allows the brain management systems
The video shows how sounds change the direction immediately when the sound-impress is part of them.
Researchers have increased countries with genetically modified neurosystems so that they can be controlled by sound-to-albums.
Small sugars change the direction immediately when they get the sound imple, which is too high to hear the human corner.
Impulses operate by switching genetically modified business cells with the ultrasonians reactions of brain cancers.
Question on: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the madders show a new, sound generation name, the functionality of the method, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and body cells outside the body.
Sreecanth Chalasani, researcher of the Salk Institute in California, reported to The Guardian that a method can be replaced by a deep smiling, which is an invasive action leading to the brain to therapy of Parkinson.
Sugar disorders do not normally react to ultrason, but Chalasani found that when they are around the liquid with a small microscopic complex, the situation changed.
He realized that the balls confirmed the ultrasonal ships that then go into the land.
Verified ultrasonalities affect TRP-4-ionian canab, structures that are in certain cells of some countries.
The vote sectors will receive these ionians to open and activate cells that are enabled in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to prepare ultra-screen sodiums, Chalasani modifyed countries genetically so that their business herbal cells are TRP-4-ionians.
When Chalasani used ultra-modified mathematics, the microscopes confirmed the sound boards and switched them into the maths where they skipped the modified commercial hero cells.
The method has some of the same designs as optogenetics, swimming tool that gives scientists the possibility of skilling hero cells up and remove the light pulses by using.
However, Chalasani says that soundgenetic use may have some interests in comparison with optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent from the optical to the long-term desires of the brain, the low-loading ultrasonal sectors can slowly pass through the skin, so they can be sent to the brain on the face.
"We know that geneitherapy and therapy virus may be possible by using human neurocellular cells to react at the moment in certain neurologs in clinical treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could be focused on cells produced in body cells and insulin, he added.
It's an unfaithful competitive instrument for your home!
The reports may be shocked by the British arms trade.
See the video of Amnesty International's weapons.
Awesome killer machines!
I've got shocked legs!
Shut Booms!
Electronic snacks that cause pain but do not leave shocks!
The joyful language of the image and series does not doubt that this world’s largest arms news is a tragic parodi that Amnesty International has produced to emphasize the difficulty of the British Government to trade weapons to the Defence and Security Equipment International Exception Center in London in the fields where it is available.
Objective: DSEI arms: authorised administrations are reached in London
In the afternoon of a special campaign, many proclamations have also appeared to bus publishers and metroways, which require more accurate knowledge.
"True Information, Travel Station on DLR lines on September 15-18?" On the other hand, it is asked by using London 's land source and product character, as a bank image changed by the DLR board.
In September, weapon traders arrive to DLR... customers are requested to help stop the weapons.
These 300 declares are the works of artists whose work was represented by Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
Collective named Special Patrol Group has helped publish the statements around London by using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This includes six red packs of six cocktails, which are called the colleague, "bear hands on the third part of the world's advertising state of the whole bus package."
Transport for London has not been disappointed by this unlawful "jurisdiction".

According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs and University of Essex’s newspaper, artists want to ask more and want to bring political work to the external publics of the gallery.
Many artists have started working with the aktivists in oppositions when they have found that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
The second proclamation of the weapons was welcomed by the workers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 1000,000 times during the last 24 hours. It was found freely by the VCCP advertising office, and also the graphic designer and the background manager had been freely worked.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever's found that weapons were not mentioned. And also in the ExCeL calendar, it was empty and thought, "Lay them the campaign they try to avoid."
They were thinking of the more realistic corporation of the newspaper, but "the more stopping body pressures things with light colors and animations."
"They have done fantastic work by helping us to raise questions about the unlawful competitive instrument to sell", says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now, the United Kingdom government must take action and ensure that competitive instruments are not legally sold by our own homes.
Perhaps the most creative art of the arms will be associated with ExCeL when showers trade fantastic beautiful products.

Eight golden rules for living in students
11 years later, when I was a 19-year-old age, I changed to a student, and I still believed in baret and moral relations, but now I remember the poor and several, long-term delays of the people I'm disappointed.
Most of my learning can intensify eight simple rules.
Change in the apartment may be the entire fear of any nervous use.
It's shocking in the house: tell me where you're home, you're demanding a interim and what you think about Corbyn, and why, in fact, "I love Marmite, or hate Marmite because it's just a sweetness of Ha ハ ハ me finding in my room."
Take a life.
And help others to ask questions and share interest.
It controls discussions and helps you find people you like, and not those who do not want to speak even if your eyes are in the fire and they shared shammits.
Give people a place.
People’s rooms are often turning into cocktail, leaflets, and generally timeless places, but they also are places where people shoot and correct their bathrooms.
Regarding the question: Don't even imagine your university when you are a couple
The universist is a strict place for the introverte.
Your care should be relaxed, but many households are forming a culture that is friendly, socially and vitally causes life friendships.
It can mean hell to somebody who try to relax.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I want to be friend with you and I want to be with you, but you have to get away that I can get back to the energy that I've discussed with you."
Try to see when a student's friend has cut into socialization, and maybe send text message to the door instead of copying.
I'm going to tell you about the computer.
A guy of my student's house was aware that if the door wasn't in the lock, he was called in.

The National School has a large number of people from 12 different nationality.
They are already in Finland some time students, as well as new low-security demanders.
All in the shooting box have a A expectations.

The East Shuman police investigated the assault as a shock and a crime in home.
Accordingly, the event was considered to students as a lunch of information, where there was also the needlines.
There's no panic here, and nobody wants to get out.
We have been twenty years old foreign students, and this is the first time when something happens about this," Lucifer says.
It's a shock that the battles have already been cut off the wall.
The technicians doubtless were at least three men, and they were moved on a skilled car.
I think it's a young weekend of the headquarters when this is now on the roof.
There's nothing more serious than it," Lucifer says.
Also, Sal has been decreased in a hospital that has been cut off the receipt centre.
The meeting happened last week.
It's what I told you on the MTV website last night.

From Helsing to Raasepor, the Y-june walking to Karja stops walking in March.
The new one shocked the passengers to the beginning of that junk at Helsinki’s headquarters.
Some of the undergrounds attacked the volunteers, said, Torbjörn Bengtström.
That's stupid, because the number of people grow all the time and workers need rapid and close contact in Helsinki.
This can't be anything else than the political will or the lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's video's conversation is coming even if in the main city of Tractors.

The Y wine also uses other than rasisporians and conjunctionists, since it is fast and takes several positions.
A spood Annina Pöyrya slaughtered the city’s longer journeys.
"It's named a slaughter for those who have to be planned to retrace their journey," he said when he worried to the Y flight.
It's a little facility.
The Radio Railway is incoming a new connection that replaces Y-june Helsing's transport in the HSL (HSL) region until our church.
This increases costs to HSL, in practice, to the values of the region and to their taxpayers.
"We are now going to find different options and their impact on services and lift prices", said the director of HSL Suvi Richtnime.
The costs are still unable to assess accurately.
My report tells that, on the basis of the number of passengers, HSL has paid the Y-year-old year, and the Ministry has been much more.
The R line on the main side will leave between two positions.
Instead, in Ainola and Sauna Kale, the number of horses is doubled.

Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on the date of the capital book: "Marx supports the prostitute"
The crisis of the world's economy have led to Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its year 1867-1894, and to write SKP's ex-president, who is known today, in the document published by Marx's capital date.
"He will take more serious than a long time," writes Hakane in his exhibition.
Marx's opinions on capitalism development, internationalization and development on all areas of life, focus on capital and the growth of the capital and imaginative capital have proved to be a surprising cities.
The list of writers based on capital seminars is also found by Professor Aalto-symbol, acknowledged by Economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, the Korkman writes Marx's timely "being and ever."
However, is it not the Director of the Ex-Earth Research Institute and the Delegation of Life?
It's not it.
In the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not like Marxi as an temporary budgetary, but also more interesting social theories.
Today, society sciences have differed and specialized, but Marx was philosophy, historics, socialists, economic partners, journalists, political agitators, and literature hours.
"Attachmental concept is that academic history tells the wrong views of the dead men," Kurkman begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies have been ridicule.
Although Marx understood the creation and significance of the industrial revolution, he took decisions to be too long from the capitalism’s initial gateway, Korkman found.
However, Korkman is seeing value in the radial position of Marx.
"There is more relief in Marx that she asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing on the interests of Marxk, such as the sharing of varyness.
"Marx may give inspiration to him who wants to understand the grand image, the technological changing world," Alkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow does not help Marx.
He thinks capitalism was an unexpected case that should just stop.
However, Marx supports Korkman's defense.
"In the 1970s, Marx couldn't read", says Korkman.
"Mare, tropical, and other donations hated all capitalism, but even more."
Today the debate is more multilateral, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the next year.
"Every social partner should meet Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations requires military courts in Sri Lanka
The United Nations requires the establishment of the Special Court of Justice to investigate the civil warfare of Sri Lankan, reports the AFP.

The report accuses of the armed weapons, both Sri Lanka and the renowned capitals.
In the internal war, Sri Lanka is estimated to die at least 1000,000 people.
There's no check of information about the victims.
In particular, in the last few months of the long-weapon attack, the United Nations report is required.
The report of the Sri Lanka's weapons condemns the complaints, struggles and systemic sexual violence, which was probably the victim of men as women.
The capitals reported that they were accused of evacuation of visitors and children.
The report shows that both parties are accused of murders.
Sri Lanka replied in a medium week that it would like to organize the investigation itself, but would not allow the establishment of the Court of Justice because of the foreign judges.

The fourth thing again was pretty nice to Lybeck.
It had to write a phone for the reasons why enterprises should pay young people to work.
"At least in our school has been performed in writing talks," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experience "too normal".
The Finnish or Swedish experience has responded to the questions of the texts that, for example, would be adapted to the summer climate change and the processing of large data.
In the mid - week, some Russians were also written in a larger range (168 students), Germany (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The scene writes continue on Thursday, in the mountain, with a second home or a test of Sweden or Finnish.

From your mouth of the hakane is cut off from the smell of Kaisaniema, from the mouth of Manerheim.
Is Helsinki's police office enough, super-Commissariat Seppo Kujala?
Repeat, at least it seems enough.
I don't want to take care of the police's work.
According to Kuching, Helsinki is coming because of the statement, supporting parties from another Finland.
I'm not telling the police about the partisans.
"And a compartment is coming, but we're going to be in our own way," Kujala says.
The police calls for prevention of private cars at Helsinki's center on Wednesday morning.
Assessing that the worst transport cost is at the level of Hakaniemer's nuclear center.
Reasonable transport is expected from morning to start.
Change back to the intelligence artists from Finland, Helsinki has also arrived a lot of opportunities buses.
They're not going to decide to the Rautator.
The bus will remain on the time to stop.
The final journey will then be walking to the place of mind,” Kujalla says.
It's also a stopping the Helsinki shipping.
The police's view here's a positive half.
The problem of the transmission, which is normally in these grands' meetings, will now be handled by itself.
The organizations of the opinion have reported to the police that Helsinki may be ten thousands of opposers of the economic policy of the Government.
The police is waiting for an opinion to be peaceful.
Sometimes there are normal workers or unemployment -- normal citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
A number of Finnish parties are also organized on Wednesday.
It's like, in the first morning, that's an extraordinary way. Do you remember these laws and minds?
It is often interesting and exceptional towards the master's celebration on the birthday of the vocational associations.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of the Finnish political history, says the professor of the Sociology of the University of Jyunesky, professor of the University of the Sociology of the University of Jyunesky.
You're not wondering that the monster's protest.
If it wouldn't do so, it would shoot the hands before the government, he says.
A good legal government has attacked the traditional nuclear points of the Finnish corporates, and also towards those who have been important for the development of the Finnish well-being State.
The rule of the government is missing the law of the contract.
There are many aspects of the fact that we really try to get the poles.
It also has a place to look at the ball.
For example, the games are needed, for example, to not have the support of all payers for the first day of the Monday.
The new is now the sharp share of which the impression is being held in the group that the age would like to participate in the mental exhibition.
The unemployed ones of the various parts of Finland were pleased to be addressed at the committee at November 1993.
If the summary of the mental world is looking for a comparison point, it could be a decrease of unemployed disappearance, the Murrostorstae organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deeply organized Murrostors, a 200,000 unemployment was collected.
The Eco Ahon (kesk) government will comply with the employment market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and the salary organizations had never been the same bad as during the foreign government of Aho.
Now the interaction between the government and the air movement is still worse than in the time of Murrostors.
In addition to the power, the Finnish government has never had a very portory government, the Single says.
The current government coalition is still interested in the fact that it is so strictly legal, despite the fundamentality of the Somalia.
Another time, there were some elements of old workers.
The place is expected for a number of thousands of thinking artists on Sunday.
The meditation also stops public transport and also closes daily and schools.
The difficulty of mind receives undivided support for payers, it may be for the greatest years.
In Helsinki, the last few years has been organized for about 300 incentives per year.
They're going to be loaded.
Traditionally, in Finnish's opinions, it has been particularly peaceful, although the workers have been overlooked in the past few years.
Traditionally, the Finnish opinion is engaged in conflicts, being lawful.
The advisers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of their property, says the Single.
However, the end of the 1990s has been new toys.
It's changed.
The EU's membership was nervous to shoot farmers, and the police has been able to get their own shock.
The Palomen's Law held three months in 1998.
Such laws were also on pilots and flight drivers.
Do you remember these ladies and minds?
Metal and electrical strokes of the 1970s

The Debates Police will discover the committees of the Finnish Reactors to the Austrian police
The Austrian police has requested assistance from the Central Race Police in the detection of the Finnish refugee-related disorders.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Asterheim near the German border, a ship that had 42 refugees.
There's no information whether the rich was possible to travel to Finland.
It's all right in the kitchen.
We've got information with the Austrian police.

In the book, they present the channels of human transport, propose solutions, and present secret traffickers from the different doors of business.
HS's presenting five of them.
I'll get out of them right away
On the east of Tunisia, the islands are not shocking foreign tourists, but many Tunisia are directioning there to the sustainability.
Only 120 kilometers from the island of Lampedus, which is located in Italy, is also excellent for its location.
Because of the comparison, the past of Helsinki to Tallinna is about 85 miles [85 km].
There, in the village of El Attaya, is located in Emir, the captain to smoke, and the six-child father.
The icelands are part of their snakes, but the fisherman is more productive to transport people.
And Emir has done it in a slow, ten meters of trees that have already been able to tell hundreds of people.
If the ship is full, it's going to 40 people.
On the other hand, Emir will take about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
He's got five people who's looking for him for customers around Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arabs, a huge number of tunas wanted to escape disappointments.
Then the situation was calm until it turned back to a refugee crisis later.
Customers are coming from the maintenance to the Kerkenna Sea in small groups.
Order strikes them into the empty houses as long as it's good.
Food is given so that customers are right and still lived.
The message will pay about 75 euros from night, and if the customer ends with money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night.
First night, we'll get out of the island, then stop, waiting day, and we'll be eaten next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes marine use is hard, and in 20 meters highways, passengers smile and smile.
In the meantime, the human grain has been buried in half an hour, and Emir will go back to the back.
Emir wants us to be afraid of him.
For that reason, he disappoints his customers, and at least claims that he is deceived by the hangourers of the spirit.
In the book she tells that when the police once missed him, he took all his passengers over the ship and told them to take them to the nearest island.
"I've seen customers to the individuals and I shooted them over the ship," Emir says in the book.
Railway travelers come from the south of Zahara.
His landmen have to hear it's bad to do this.
I'm going to get out of them right now.
They have to show immediately who's going to be here.
A normal taxi currency
Goran is just a normal taxi shop in Bogovia in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good starting engineer, and it has been seeing the best day.
However, the main thing for Goran's customers is that the tax is exceeding and that it moves to the Hungary border.
Bogovaś is about 500 pounds of small populations from Belgrade to a lunch of about 60 km.
This is located in the centre used for security customers, which is mainly intended for families.
From the midst of the forests without their family, traveling men in the bathrooms, low and abandoned cars that everyone has now been able to find or build.
The forest also lives in families that have not been caused or otherwise left a security request in Serbia.
Some are also in private housing, but it is public secret.
Gora's troops find the largest part of its customers.
These are often swimming - through the Balkan road requires a large number of limits and weekly walking routes in a difficult landscape, often in mountain areas and darkness.
Finally, in the Bogovia region, the largest part of human transport, people are deceived.
The Cyctics of Goran are mostly asirians, Afghanians, Pakistanians, Iraqians and Kurdess.
The best customers are the sirians, he's telling them in the book.
"They say it once and it's enough," Goran's sweet.
He said that the Africans are trying to smile.
Goran doesn't like that.
It's a shoe in the whole way.
First, the price will be adjusted to 300 euros, then they will calculate 200 and finally provide 150.
Gorran emphasizes the man to be pleasant and encouraging.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and I'll help people," he says in the book.
Goran tells his works by spending from the other and spending from the Hungary border only 50 euros from people.
The path is 300 miles [300 km], the largest part of the motor.
The colleagues ask for a third or negative price.
Goran is a $50,000 per year.
It's not a big sum to the secret driver, but the annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has decided that taxes cannot be transported nearly 12 km from the Hungary border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the ways and the shoes and takes his swimming pools from the front of a kilometer.
Then he shows his customers the right design and smells out.
In the work of the laptop
35-year-old congoleans are called As a Minister, and it is not just a lempenname.
He really has a protesting church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, which is a large number of believers from Congo, and a small center that helps congous children.
In addition to the preaching, the Midwest Search is covered by a secret transport area where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He's looking at his work on the work of the ladder.
It's important to the poster to look good.
He smells his skin several times a day and keeps worried that the smell of white pools slowly cut down the low shock of skin.
The sender trainer is proud of the new Mercedes, its land car and three motor drivers.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Kong to Ukraine and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five of the phone number of a sender.
He suggests that the border will be encouraging to arrive in the morning, hide the money visionally and shoot the border over any of the traders that are walking.
In order to obtain a security applicant or a refugee station, the Ugandan authorities must report that there is, for example, home from the Northern Kiv War Area and that violence has been flewn in their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Sender will organize a new identity to the customer.
An old personality certificate will be deleted and the state will be obtained by another.
That's what you're going to do with the missionary contacts in the Uganda police.
The customer will then be managed to the same place where certain security visitors go: the procedure for security, the establishment of civilian organizations, finally to UNHCR.
The missionary feels of the office, because it has become a refugee in Uganda.
He counts on each other: the request to leave the Uganda police pays about 100 euros, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization at about 150 and the process of change, for example, 4 500-7,000 euros in some European countries.
Folders and floors
Tom's an initial secret driver, the former drug skill.
The four-year-old Irish swimming pool in the French beach in Calais, where his work is to hold people on the road to Britain.
He has a Afghanian, French taxi pocket in London, as well as ten rears that do not necessarily know whether he is in human transport.
On the dinner Tom and taxi kitchen spend their customers, usually 2-3 people, some of Calais's centers.
They're thinking of A26 motors, and they're trying to safeguard the police.
If the police stopped the car, Tom and the driver would be in prison directly on the order of unlawful immigration.
That Tom doesn't want, he's sit down for seven years of drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom walks over the Customer Motors at a slow-screen swimming swimming stairs before the channel continues to the UK.
Tom chooses the suitable skill to ensure that it's just on the way to England, not even in Hollanti, and he's shooting a safe snake.
It's going to be quiet, so they're going to wake up.
Sometimes the snake's drinking with you, but then the skin is more calm.
When the road is clear, Tom screws his customer to the aluminium folion, similar to that in the kitchen it is a lost or a refrigerator around the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's heat scanning to see the hidden.
Some use the same purpose with shoes filled with the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customer's richness and gets out of the place, hopefully hoped that not at least before Britain.

People will be shooted to minibuses and shoot somewhere down the beach.
They are ordered to hide vegetation in a group of people and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it's got to get up to the ship.
Travellers have to remain all the way under the hidden side.
The marine station can only check how deep the ship is, since other signs of the human team are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but what less passengers will get out and take, it's better.

But finally, he went to panic.
He's just shooted at the beginning and defended his headquarters on the ground.
However, 150 meters before the land, his power had been defeated.
He shocked the ray, and other competitors shocked him one after each other.
I felt myself stupid, and I thought I would never go anymore.
However, I packed myself over the library, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton found that he suffered from two directional disorders.
His brother Dan had done years before Sydney's suicide, and he himself felt great success.
Favor Hamilton was 43-year-old mother when she became prostitution in Las Vegas.
There were no economic problems in Paris, but she was a wonderful idea to get money on the struggle of sex with the guests.
He also overcome his husband to accept his work.
Favor Hamilton was $450 per hour.
He's telling him how he uses the money to snake.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanation for prostitution was also that he thought the same adrenaline pieces as he had in competition with its general sports.
Afterward, Favor Hamilton found that he was ill with two directions of mind illness.
The second life of the first star juice came at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published his article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters from the world statistics of 3,57,40, but left in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The Master of the World was slow when the Alliance was put into the Norwegian snake: "The Great"
The Norwegian Countries Petter Northug has exceeded at least one of its colleagues in mind.
The Northug and the Norwegian Railway Association have completed all over the course of the sports agreement last year.
Although the Union has offered Northug better agreements than other sportors, it has not been reduced to a multiface of world masters and Olympics.
The results of the Contract of the Norwegian Covenant decided to close Northugin from the cup of the world for the coming time.
The decision was grateful for Astrid Jacobsen, the two-eenth World Master.
He said he was glad that the alliance was put on a shoe.
"Thank you've been able to switch up," Jacobs wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one attractive Sporter to defeat the favor of the union sponsor", he continued.
The Norwegian Railway and Northugin Railway is about the money.
Northug would apparently want to be part of a long country team so that he could show his sponsor.
Jacob said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for the future generations, and does not give one sporter’s soil.
He then recalled that the Union has given the North as financial as well as the other privileges for many years.
I know it because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one sporter has very different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published its own information in which he convinced his desire to be sported in the Norwegian colors for the first time in the world coffee, as well as later in MM and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen wins all six MM-mills, two golden.
She was with the last winter in Falun, a message in the winning team.
It is also carried out in the Northern country on the competition day of the patent translators
The 25.9th flights are organized in different restaurants and sells granted to the Palestinian translators.
The day is to emphasize Finland's high-scale food components and formulate its restaurants on the skill of source, and to increase information on the importance of the competitiveness.
It is likely to recall that not all high-specific restaurants have been focused on the capital site, but that the non-defenced high-screen restaurants are found around Finland.
The international attention that has occurred is an important part of the event in enhancing the sensibility of competitors and organizations.
The day in the northern country is organized in Vaas, the restaurant in Fondiks and the Office.
The whole day of the competition is involved in the Old City's restaurant.
The event has also been a major attention to internationally.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events organized during the same day in the different worlds.
Finnish is still as Dad's event.
Caucasian newspaper: The establishment of a Dutch Receiving Centre for the Jurisdictions
The Migration Agency and the Finnish Red Risti (SPR) are based on cooperation on the Receiving Centre of Pakistans for LSK Business Park Oy at the current ownership of the Honoured Excursion.
Accordingly, in the region, the critical infrastructure of the crisis is continuously located, which is the use of the Defence Forces and its Cooperation Partner, namely the Finnish Erillis Networks of Oy.
The Honour Journal reports that the investment of the receipt centre in the same structure sets a significant risk of security, which has not been prepared in the case.
According to the applicant, defence instruments may have an extensive aircraft in the region and in the airport which does not have any effect on the receipt centre when prepared.
It is noted that in the case of the Dutch field, the negotiations have been used in the last two years to organize aviation education and the income of an external operator to the airport.
This has been discussed by the Minister of Defense Jussi, and by the Chief of the Defence, Arto Rády.
The individual claims to the legal persons that there is no question for the principle of the acceptance of the Court, but that the planned place in the former security area is wrong.
The horrible city government discussed the receipt centre last night.
Similarity: Syrian situation is reflected in the Ukraine and the Eastern region

The President said that the government of the refugee has combined all participants.
He commends that the Government and opposition partners in Finland can be able to discuss confidentially on primary issues.
Especially in those days, when we have great challenges for even our own.
Indeed, the situation of Syria and the region of Russia and the United States may also have an impact on the situation of the Eastern region.
Similarity is the hope for the development of the dialogue.
If the situation is developed in a positive direction, or the United States and Russians, because it has an impact on the Ukrainian situation and continues to be aware of the ocean situation.
Indeed, Nato's questions were also held in the debate.
The President did not take a look at the job account.

Media researcher: Sipila takes the risk of son
According to the civilian communication, multiple channels are needed, and the telephones of the Prime Minister are one channel in other groups.
This is also necessary for the channel of this direct speech to continue.
This will not be the last time, Sipila said to the committee of the committee.
She did not want to evaluate how often the way of the Prime Minister's television and radio phones comes.
According to the civilian, there is no need to always interact on the Yle channels.
If the other channels are reported to be channels, then we're looking at it.
Now we're using this channel this night, Sipila said.
According to the civilian state of the Finnish economy, it is serious that it requires the maintenance of television and radio phones to the citizens.
This quote, which is now speaking, is timely complex and requires a further basis.
That's why we finished this channel, Sipila tried.
The conversation is sent at 21.05-21.20 and at TV1 and the radio in Finland.
It can also look at the General Areen.
The cyclopedia takes the risk of son
The media researcher hopes that the Sipil TV phone does not tell the most commonly translated government.
Is it an effort to take the right to define the public debate more closer to its own hand and to refuse the debate on the negotiations of the public? The professor Anu Kovunen reported by the University of Tukholm.
Soin's silent comment was to say that he does not observe the media agenda, nor let it be determined by himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not associated with each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been crazy about the report of Sipil.
It would be strange if you don't react the media.
Communications of political decision-makers are not reporting in democracy.
The representatives of the Media are definitively trying to do not to be taken by political responsibilities.
According to the exhibition, the TV phone is a great risk for Sipil.
When talking, the skill should import something new and special in the table so that the exceptional high expectations set to the speak would be filled.
Does it offer more than we have heard today?
Or can he speak to different slowness, different ways, or say something new?
Kovunen says that if the promise is only the same older, it must be wondered why such a big man has done, and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In general, it takes the risk in mind if there is no particular situation, but the routine phone in other groups.
It is the risk that the Yle is slowing into political or commission and government message, which is certainly not in accordance with the General Intress or the general line.
The open doors from the civilian
In the future of the civil debate, it is also important that the Prime Minister, without saying, highlights the media researcher.
Tonight, you will see where Sipila is missing and where it is not, says the Scientist Coordinator of the University of Jyuneskyland.
I heared that the TV call is open from Sipil, because this is how it will take his own views without the snacks.
This means that a large public will be obtained without journalist filter, other than in the status of information where the providers can submit critical questions.
He's going to take the media and talk to the people directly.
However, it is dangerous that the media comes from a false conversation, because it is not possible to submit a question.
Look, it's very important that Sipira's coming on TV... that's a valuable shoe, that's the hands.
He compares Sipil to his fatherhood, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sippia's part of speaking a good thing, it can work.
Your situation is different than when, if the government was informed about something, because this person is like speaking directly to another person.
This (United President Barack) Obama and the partners are regularly encouraging.
Executive
Political researcher Erkka Railo believes the Chairman's speech to citizens as an exceptional.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is talking directly to the people.
A slight time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to obtain the Finnish churches in advance.
The payment organizations are organized on Wednesday and Weights against the Government's actions.
The President Paavo Arhinmaki, on Twitter, says that Sippia could hold his talk on the state of the country as an advertising of the Secretary-General in which we will also be able to discuss.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) reiterates its challenge to the Sipil dialogue.
There's no time for monologue.
Shortly half years of ice.
You can't hide, Rinne's writing on Twitter.
The son of 9 years of age has been found in Tampere
The boy was in the finding box.
PUBLICING TO TO TO TO WORK AND KUNNOSSA, his son updated his Facebook page.
Anyway, the Interior Council's police office confirms this to the weather.
The boy went to play out for four hours at night.
After the night, you couldn't have contacted him again.

Thank you for the ten contacts and considerations during these hours.

The Finnish UFC star struggled for the violence of young people: You can hate at time
A credible volunteer Macwan Amirkhani has published a video on Facebook, which is especially involving immigrants to young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a painting age against the shocks of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and five years of age with its Finnish family, has gained both its professional negotiations in the most valued UFC series.
Amirkhani is telling his message that was received to look at some Instagram pieces.
The account has been downloaded videos with young people fighting extremely violently.
Amirkhmy tells me he's been struck by young people.
Amirkhan has more than 62.000 followers in Facebook.
The pools cut the land, sit on the other side and shoot eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that this happens when you do this videos, Amirkhani will update.
It's hard to defense again
Some of the youths visible on videos are immigrants.
According to the Commissioner Jarmo Heinus, the social media has loaded videos as immigrants and youths of Canadians.
We're named that you're fighting over the street.
You do so much more difficult about the life of many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has pages that are looking for immigrant crimes.
These individuals have come to very badly.
It's very difficult, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you're still visiting the country and you're coming here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhine calls young people to remember you close.
If they sometimes come into a racism, you can blame yourself.
Just think about a couple of times before you go with that, ladies.
Amirkhani says that violence has a smuggle to race.
You're gonna have a time of hate that I don't like myself.
However, you have things badly, and you're not going to make it better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its part in the cocktails, Lyly, decisions on the moon.
The President of SAK Lauri Lyly reports on Twitter that as Monday, the Ombudsman's Ombudsman's position to submit an optional list.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Office of Agency STTK previously informed its Government to submit his own proposal, which would be achieved by Mr Juha Sipil (kesk).
The President Sture Fäder believes that the government will accept a proposal if SAK, STTK and Akva are all behind the proposal.
However, it required that the largest payment organization SAK behaviour for its previous part.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in the twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Committee is treating the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the business market, and that the position of the Covenant is required for an active party agreement.
Lyly recalls that the proposal for the Cyprus Government for a social agreement was not replaced by the SAK.
The Cyprus has previously disrupted negotiations on the Community Treaty when the SAK has not agreed to reach the fifth rate of productivity goal.
Comment: The majority is threatening to smile - "Think it's a little awesome to smell skin"
The feeling of it's a little smell to smell, if you have an adjustment paper in the table, write to Pecca Tiina.
The tunnels vary in their loans.
Does it mean to smile the government or then agree with it?
On Monday, the Chairmans of the SAK condemned sacred hate against the Government of the Republic.
The whole Finland was threatened to shut up.
The smell swimming to the academics.
Professors OAJ threatened schools and daily homes.
At the same time, OAJ denied: one school or daylight is not completely closed.
In the mid-week, President Antti Palola (sd) of the Office of Agency STTK was agreed.
He reported to his government’s contact and launched the Prime Minister Juha Sipil (kesk) requires optional presentation for five percent of production.
The President Sture Fäder (kok) immediately tried to report that his appeal paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office was not part of the slaughter.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to agree when the Presidents of the Alliance just on Monday ordered to spend on the ground on Wednesday.
Finally, however, Lyly reported that the SAK Working Committee was assembled in the next Sunday to discuss the situation and that the SAK searched for solutions to “open the business market”.
In order to establish a common presentation of payers, the SAK should intend to accept the fifth productivity place.
No wonder that Palolan STTK has relationships with the government of Sibl.
Jukka Ihanus, director of the social impact of the Palola, has previously been as the special assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhase and Mari Kivininiman.
The ball also found that the age of the government has been improved all the time.
Sweet or not, but Palolan's outcome took a little clean out of the Finnish standers who were swearing the ACT's Marko Piirain (sd).
It's a little awesome to smoke if it's already in the board with an adjustment paper.
Modified om 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
The Russian shocked Finland as a bad father: "This can't be again."
The Russian Dutch President, Sergei Naryshkin, has criticized Helsing's meeting.
The Russian Dutch speaker Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, it has started an accused meeting of the Ethic Parliamentary General Assembly in Ulan Batori, in which Naryshki gave many comments on the Helsinki Summit on July.
The Finnish did not allow Russian policies to the European Union, such as Naryshkin, to arrive at the meeting - the matter that the President had taken to remind the providers.
We believe that it was opposed to the values of the parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin pressed the news office according to the Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin criticism was addressed to the United States where his access was also proposed.
The sanctifications are political self-assault from the EU, Naryshk declared.
The Mongolian delegation became complicated, so Naryshk continued the Finnish strike through the shoes and thanks to the Mongolia to "the great organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Meeting will be structural and positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that the parliamentary dialogue does not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met the meeting in Ulan Batori, the West Kanervan (kok), which has already discussed Russian delegation.
The box is a real playoff box: "Maalis in steady"
Tappara and Luke will continue in Hacamet today when both are coming on the other day of birthday.
Janne Lahti wasn't in Hacamet today seeing the prestigious dinner party.
Tappara went last night at the Coupe in a 3-2-hour flight from KalPa.
It was a man, because the gold group of the last few years was the worst of the two seats of the sea.
I'm not going to do that, but I'm going to have a little more mollusk.
The Ramaian visitor of the Blues was swimming at zero point, and the slaughter slaughtered so old 2-3.
The hard game, the lands in stairs, if one plays the same game as the last year, the Lukko attacker Janne Lahti predicted the schedules on the following pages.
The Tappar has formed a very slight playoff printer for spaces.
In fact, Tappara has been shocked in two past periods from the final harvest of Luko.
A seventh squad has been required to resolve.
Last years the Luke took a series in the fourth game, but Tappara rised on three next rings and ends.
The groups' shareholders do not have major changes, except the number of groups.
The counterparts struggled both last night's day will get the coffee year.
Tomi Karhus, Mika Noronen makes a place between Luko-Tolpe, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Visuality: A painted display in the last time
The Chairman of the Sports hoped that he wrote to the principal trainer to the Rautacall part of an inadequate continue, to write from St. Silvennow Tampere.
That's classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone posted a Rocky picture in which he himself showed the headquarters.
Instead, he set a sense to a pregnant worldwide master Apollo Creed.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though finally you lost a tract.
30 years after Rocky first night, Mika hopela was scribed to the unfavourable forecast to Pora.
Innumerable and wooden patent, I was raising all the surprises of the SM-finals 2006.
Someone was filled with unnamed rocky, but sweet sweethearts.
It was a White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelt.
The players bleeded their head red and shocked the irokes.
It's a blond of hope.
The newspaper JP Jalo calls a trainer as Newmann.
You're taking the winning hope.
I hope there was one of the heroes.
The handbook hopes that this time's renewing work will operate in the same way as a ten years ago.
The man who works as a director of the Sports has built the slaughter of the slaughtery sons.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have remained in the beach like Rocky's sugar sweats.
Masi Marjamen, Miko Vitase, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kupary are in some other parts than in a strike game.
The hope has forgotten that Rocky VI's headquarter presents Pecca Radakal.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautacalle Sean Conners.
The Railway is in the Notice in Rocky, which is the same principal rapporteur as Connery had been at the original exhibition of 1976.
There's nothing else to Rocky in the rail.
Railable filosophics do not include rupture and small cutting.
He values hard games, but it's a different thing to play hard than a smooth.
In recent years, Esseen Garret Stafford put the Tappara Jere Karja's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Rautacalyt puts a man in the shooting.
He didn't get a minute!
We're just playing those who do.
I don't accept that game, and it does not belong to the kitchen, the warning of the Rautakalol was cut off after the game to the Sunday National.
The team of this time has been built a strange.
There are kids, veterans, police and targets.
The best keys in the age of the game have no practice.
It's not wondering that the principal trainer has chosen a shock.
How many have you been able to affect players, Peca Radakal?
In recent years, the events affected the purchase and, unfortunately, the situation in the market had been over time, and the Railway was diplomatically answered.
I'll be on the castle.
The 1953 Railway model is wisely interested in moveing to the hope to sports.
The men's agreements end up in the hot.
There are a lot of losses in three days on the floor 1-6.
I hope I wouldn't have encouraged the manuscripting part of the prosecution.
Olga Temone shows Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone shows that if he had met his husband as one of the twenty-years, they had nothing to do.
Olga Temone shows his husband's first time in the control of her husband.
Yeah, I'm showing a movie for my man's friend's mother.
At the same time, it feels crazy, shower and producer Olga Temone's smiling.
He's been married to an ex-basist and director of the Aboriginal Aboriginal since 2008.
Paris has made many work together, but now Olga is the first time shown in the Fire Guide.
Olgan's role in the early years of the Island, you've been in the beautiful picture of us is a slim Sipe Santapuk Mother Sirka.
Sirkka tights and supports his son, even though this father Risto (for Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be my voice.
What more I have learned of my real example in Sirka, it is easier to represent the role.
She's a great guy, and I'm grateful for Monday that he trusted the role to me.
Olga had met Sirka before film project, but then two of them were closed.
They've met, talked at the phone, and they've been communicating.
He's got a lot of help.
We've been through a lot of different circles through their history.
Cyrus also is happy to understand that the Drama is a drama and the truth may have a little coloring.
Olga stressed that Sirka was nearly the only one who believed that the island would become the largest in Finland.
The 1990s had a long and a real enemy.
It was a small probability that someone really did, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me he had heard from Tuuk a lot of this young man already before film plans.
However, the history of parents has been a little different.
Yes, if you're 15-year-old, so how many parents really know what you're wooden.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different than the wicked snack of Henoa.
Olga was an arch and pleased a girl who hadn't had a movie with the "Food".
And so he could have been able to shut up.
Olga said he has done so much to cooperate with the Hour for ten years that the great joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been a super-hystery.
Now the whole product group is going to be a monthly description to Henow.
In the meantime, a couple who lives in the meantime really wants to spend a while because of their little children often at night also home, because the interim is not too long.
We'll rule the whole month of Henow.
They've taken us very warmly, just asked what you're going and when it's empty.
Iron Sky 2 increased in the Finnish calendar as a screening image
Timo Bergensolan leader Iron Sky: The Coming Race's budget on 17 million euros.
The descriptions start in October in Belgium.
Manager Timo Bergensola starts a picture of the Iron Sky 2 photo in October in Belgium.
Scyphile picture Iron Skyn's footage part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is the most likely for all times in Finland to be a screening picture of 17 million euros in the budget.
Previously, the most popular film in Finland was Jalmari Helander's Big Gama.
The animation of Angry Birds, which has been made, also has been prepared by Iron Sky 2: because the film budget is more than 100 million euros.
In October, the pictures of the films produced by Timo Mountain and Tero to the Depth start at Antwerpen near the AED Studio sites and sustain the eight weeks.
Manager Timo Bergensola is going to Belgium for the next week.
You're not scared of the budget.
I've been sick!
I've got such a ratio of the Fili's manuscript, because I know what's going on.
All of the working groups feel that they do something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is stretched, there's no fear in the shock.
Better I'm impressed, and I'm not waiting for the public of this leaf, he's talking to the Wall Street.
The first film budgets were covered by 8 to 10 million, but in the development of the manuscript, the budget also increased.
Budget is great, but it's a great store.
However, the movie should be 100 million, since each image and efficacy are so slight.
It's now all been wrong so strict that there's no finding.
Life production company Iron Sky Universe has started today in a mid-week of funding campaign and a group of funds that are payed for a year of 4-8 per cent.
The final rate shall be determined as a question and offered during the campaign.
After two years, the company returns the law.
The photo of the action shows otherwise Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Chengty or cool?
Imposed logs will return to packs
The slowness of the trends have recently corrected the deficiency logs.
Another time ago, a modern shooting shooter switched clearly and grand logs like Cross' manuscript.
The marking of the skin or the t-payder was shown to some of them as a shirt.
They're changed.
Sports has become the right model megatred, and so also older, well-known sports models such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the aallonharriage.
And as often soon as it is before, the border of the skin and the trend is smiling: if there is a right shoe, then it becomes irone and cool.
First, the normal core train, or a swimming model in which the trends were surprised by recommending the most sweet basic clothes that could be separated from the mass.
Now, it is put into the corner, instead of the corner, already on the base of the cabin, which is covered by the logo of the manufacturer.
What's more and more traditional, it's better.
In addition to logs, for example, Aadas identified rail systems, the favorite teams and the New York Yankees bridges have made a return to refunds.
The start of the Faculty border Calvin Klein logos are well detailed now.
Tredi seems to be moved from a sport mark also to a light bridge.
For example, the decline of the headquarters of Versace clears what is the sign of the clothing concerned.
Are you willing to show the logs in your shoot?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn't know what I was feeling at the bank!
According to the reports, a special interval would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which was considered as Russian Arms Expo 2015, represented by Russian war industry.
The Russian media has recently issued a colorful statement, which stated that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to move from the large number of Zotovia tanks for five hours.
So Zotov has done everything to thank the information.
He even published on his own public pages on a picture where he seems to be shocking a panzer vehicle in particularly good tunnels and not at least on the basis of their pictures, it is something about a shock or anger.
You're going to have a shooting shoe.
Let's begin that I didn't go inside to a fighting barrier, but it was a blue-shaped row of PC-3.
I'm the former soldier, the Chairman, I'm serving Ural.
I went inside, watched around me, and came out in peace, Zotov said the Comosomolska to Pravda.
I didn't talk, and I really didn't take five hours in that place, he said.
The Russian army TV Zotov explained in his showing in Russia's new technology, because he is the former professional state.
That's why I'm interested in what's inside the ships, and I'm a chance for our technology.
And I came out through the bathroom, he said.
I've been in all the tanks.
And in the next show, I will be urged to visit all the tanks and all the shooting ribbons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also shocked on the question as a type of supplier.
One idiot wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and sluzhba, but nothing that I had been talking about to the bank wasn't happening, he said the Russian sluzhba newcast to the radio.
Zotov’s words support that no photo of claiming has not been published, although the installation has been placed for a few days for a total of 500,000 people.
The mention of Zotov's slaughter went on the start of the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to his shooting shooting out by trying and finally shooting all around, if he reached the shooting.

The Finnish Country Report today of the International Monetary Fund of the IMF is a long-term view of the Government and the Ministry of State security.
The system patented Finnish structural reforms in order to achieve the economic problem.
The IMF believes that the reduction in super-employed refunds and the expenditure of expenses supported Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the entire agreement system and for unemployment security.
According to Pasi Cooppama, the main economy of the Danke Bank is agreed to be the same, but small differences are also found.
In the opinion of the IMF, there is a lot of reports to the government, but there is also a warning words of what should not be too much cutting.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, which are the counterparty said to the Talossaname.
The Growth projects would also support IMF to implement in the timetable as fast as possible, so that they support weak economic growth.

Finnish is only to reach lower security demanders
In February 2015, the Swedish Migration Agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are lost each year.
In other words, SVT and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their net pages in the Swedish Migration Agency lost hundreds of applicants per year.
The supervisor Juha Kannelland of the Migration Agency tells what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is that the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants are going to lose "land below" in the year? - Finnish total 156 in 2013 on the low-security application.
They've lost nine.
In 2014, the applicants were made in 196 and lost 11, the Cannelland reported.
In the context of the defect, it may be that the applicant has already registered in any other country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and may have been identified in the full-year age there.
Thus, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to be treated in Finland and to be returned to a country responsible for the process of the application.
The following part of the losses will also be found when they find a safe place from another Member State.
In 2014, the applicants of safeguards in Finland were all 3651, whose 134 applications had made a warm decision because the applicant probably had changed from Finland, so the adult demanders lost 123 in the last year.
Is the number of growth?
To 6.9 of this year, we have been a total of 586 low safe applications for the lowest place.
The total statistics of lost low-commerce applications this year are not yet available, but the number of low-commercies has therefore been informed and has clearly increased the effect of the number of losses.
How is it going to be the ones receiving a translating decision?
Do they, for example, fall on the dark labour market?
This is difficult to be assessed from the Migration Office, as the police answers to the implementation of the translation decisions, the Kannel country is stressed.

Psychology Council: This is how you tell children of refugee
Many parents have recently come to consider how to tell children about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or do you want to tell me anything?
This is not necessary to take a public talk, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff Council.
The smaller children are supporting protection, and, for example, they do not give the news alone.
Small children can't always understand what they see, and it can't be able to smile in mind and smile, he says.
However, if a child has disrupted the newspapers of refugees or has heard otherwise, it supports the conversation.
The debate is good to visit the child's starting points and to listen closely to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprised.
They do not necessarily be those who are older thinking of him.
You know, the child doesn't have to be scared of it, even if it would hurt and fear yourself.
Small children follow the conduct of their parents.
If parents themselves remain peaceful during the conversation, children also experience their safety.
The grandchildren are probably going to break the conversation of refugees in school, friends or networks.
Parents must be good to take them a matter to talk if you think about the child.
The fact is that all humans do not have good things in the world.
Parents can be able to think about how to do this in our family.
But is the world thinking that final ends are safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different trends of growth - some may want to protect their children according to the possibilities of suffering.
On the other hand, if a family is also talking about difficult matters, the child has a model of how to handle the challenges in the future of life.
This can be useful for him.

The hopes of the North have the Vermossa shoes.
However, it is a different way to agree on the Palestinian of Apilan.
It’s a difficult time to go in the kitchen and may be shocking down the car under the tree and it’s like that.
I hope the oro would be more peaceful than the Turu goes.
The Palestinian will be able to be able to get out of the cloud, and we're going to go to the win, the trainer promises.

There are other programs that do not work like that.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, the Cookie has added.
The Apple therefore investigated this, because the company does not want to duplicate the memory status of the iPhone phone users.
In August, inflation in the euro area was 0.1%
In August only 0.1% of the annual year, the EU statistical authorities reported the Eurostat today.
The prices increased downwards the half of the energy.
Eurostat checked that a couple of weeks after 0.2 percent of the pre-compensation is a little lower.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August 0.9 per cent was 1,0 per cent of the basic inflation.
The Eurostat's pre-valuement for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent in the euro area in the last month than a year ago.
A total of 28 countries in the EU average inflation was in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, the largest European countries, 1.4 per cent of consumers, increased in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was at least 1,9 per cent of prices.
In Finland inflation was 0.2% of the mining mark according to the EU harmonised price index.
The inflation of the euro area is still far away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) aimed to increase the prices of two per cent in the average period.
The ECB predicts the euro area at average 0.1 % of inflation for this year.
The next year increased by 1,1 per cent, the Central Bank was in the beginning of September in its new inflation developments.
The United States, Fed, is trying to declare the monetary policy
The next round of the United States starts the fastest after the year, but more than three years after the Fed Central Bank again began to increase its height.
And on the financial market, the dimension will start on its part before the next time.
Fed has settled to start up the highlights that may have already been already in this week and last year.
Thus, the next fund may be pressed by the most rapidly towards the first stage and the rate of the financial markets before it.
Or at least if the largest economy and the financial markets have been working as they have been... and if they react to the currency of Fed's money as they have done before.
These guidelines have been concluded by the German Bank London Market Research Strategy for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in the broad range of long-term market and economic cycle research.
The bank distributed more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study for the international research report for large customers last week.
The strategies set out in the research and report do not believe to know when Fed is taking a specific time to increase its rate or what happens in the economy and on the market then.
Instead, they present economic statistics through their realities and calculations how the economic and markets have previously been conducted during and after them.
In addition to historical observations, they will consider how the main changes in the economic and financial market are now in the same or other model as in the time of previous highlights and what it can follow.
It is obvious that the economic and financial markets are now slightly slow to sustain higher rates than once before the 1950s.
Maybe it's not a year.
The leaders of the Fed's monetary policy and its golden circulation are long-term and starting stores that the time starts to be skilled to the expense of the heights.
The first emphasis for over nine years may be incurred in this week.
The case will be addressed in the mid-week and at the time that the Fed Committee called open market committee shall decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The previous time Fed acknowledged the so-called Fed funds in June 2006.
Once two years, there was a relative regular, but once, a series of highlights of 0.25 per cent units, with Fed increased by 1,25 per cent of 5,25 per cent.
The symptoms of the financial market began in 2007 with the most dangerous financing of the United States, and a year later the financing crisis reacted to the global pressure of the Court of Justice.
In 2009, the largest tour was taken.
Recently, serious oppositions in the financial market and real economy began to be higher than after the previous Fed's highlights have been typically performed.
Really, the tests were harder and slighter than once ago the lamb of the 1930s.
The German strategies have decreased the increases of the world's largest economics and rates, as well as the translation of the financial markets from 1950 and at the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's highlighting and their economic and financial impacts have been made clear since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the first highlight, it has been the most rapid time of the year, mostly less than three years and the average of less than three and half years.
The rate of the financial market has been concluded two years after the start of the Fed's highlighting rates.
Fed has risen in the mountain and has been calculated in the mountain at the start of the 1950s, with a circle of painting.
Each time has been deleted from some of the other parts, and the reporter has considered a relative swimming swimming snack, so that on the basis of these, it may not be possible to conclude the effects of the following emphasis.
Strategics also remember that this time many things are different.
And it's not just better.
Rate too long on the bottom
The reasons for resolving the financial crisis could not necessarily be obliged to find out unprecedentedly even in the forum of the decades of research.
But three of the reasons that are leading to the crisis and its destructive force are unlikely to find out:
1) Fed, the euro area and the largest largest central banks in the world had to be too long than the 2000s.
They were placed after the technology, and they growed on the same.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the estimates of the decades have been collected and, above all, too larger amount of debt increased in the impact of the financial policy of the Central Banks.
He syncted the greatest debt of the economist history.
3) In particular, the disadvantaged detention of the financial sector involving the majority of the financial market shares of the largest currency of the economic history in the interests, the most debts and benefits of the shares of the financial history.
Indeed, it is very worried that the financial markets in the amount of more complex bonds were rarely dangerous and insufficient when Fed and other central banks last past higher levels.
The financing structures covered by the bonds have not been supported as the time after the highlights were started and the costs of the financing were turned to the growth.
The risks were being carried out as a financial crisis, and it would follow a great deal.
Greater ball and more bond
The German strategies do not consider what is happening as follows, but give the subject to the summary, for example, the following items:
1) Fed and other larger central banks have now maintained their financial policy as much longer than the financial crisis.
If the cuts were too long before the cryss were too long, they were still slower now.
2) The obligation has not been long as ten years ago, but the bond is now more grateful than the expression.
Thus, the obligation of the financial and real economy has not been decreased, but now in different parts of the economy, the debt is slower than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) A larger part of the liquidity flows from the central banks has remained on the financial markets and the main ranges of papers and ownerships of their funds and funds, as well as at the time before the financial crisis.
And not only the Latin tunnel strategies in the financial market warning marks, but also noted that even the United States economy has not yet undergoing the financial crisis and the weakest model of it as it has been before.
The economy of the euro area is probably not anymore.
The reality is, on the other hand, an uncommon weakness, but it corresponds to the financial markets and the risks relatively larger than before the financial crisis, when Fed next began to switch its money to the more closer.
Maybe the French Bank of the Société General Strategy Albert Edward's future picture isn't so strange as it can be affected.
He has already prepared international investor customers for the following translations:
First of all, Fed's upsets, and then the finances are slow... and soon Fed's time is to shoot finances from the biggest QE currencies.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturing computers and outputs will have to reduce even 33000 jobs.
In the case of HP's business services, the company reports.

General: Minister Berner has operated in the government of the tax paradise company
Mr Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communication, has been a member of the government of the company in general.
I believe that the company is involved in such a tax plan.
This is from the luxury Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the Government of Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself says that he left a membership in May this year.
I checked this, and it's enough that I left the difference.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the register chains will happen in the appropriate timetable, Berner says in the Ule debate.
Membership after fusion
By means of the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kerhrs company is managed.
Kerhrs is a park producer who was smoking with a Finnish park producer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner operates in the government of the Karelia-Upofloor 2010-2013 and after the fusion of Khars and the luxury company.
In fact, the ownerships of Khars are walking in Luxembourg through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he took the government's deputy in the luxuryburg company on the request of Kerhrs to the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with Hartwall Capital in the government of Karelia-Upofloor.
The company was received a cooperation partner found from Swedish.
This company owned a capital shareholder in Luxembourg.
I believed that my own task was to care for the implementation of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we be worried that the capital of our Finnish enterprises will be taxed in Finland and that subsequent issue was secure in this regard, says Berner.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not join tax plans.
According to Berner, a complex ownership structure used for taxparts is due to the fact that the largest owner of Khars had the capital fund for Triton for ownerships already been prepared for the luxemburg holding company.
In the spot, it is opened by the management of the company

The STTK is preparing the alternative working package
STTK began to prepare alternative packages for the churches of life in the government.
The system also hopes that other donor centre organizations.
According to President Anti Palola, this is the point of view at the spring of the morning.
Alternative methods to reduce the price of work will be returned after it.
Everyone understands that life continues after the Sunday, Palola noted the meeting of the organization's administrative meeting on the table of suppliers.
Assessing that the Central Life Organization (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The Economists estimated that the change in the competitive package contained by the Government will pay to the employee from EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2.700 million.
I don't know if it's a big innocence to visit the discussion if there's one relationship with one.
Palla: Renewal contact was to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipila (cesk.) has hoped options for a half-week, since the government has to give its own package information to the committee and to initiate the preparation of reforms.
The ball didn't take a shock if the timetable was realistic.
The discussion connection to the government is, according to Paloa, exists, and it has been from him to build all the time.
In particular, the operation of Sunday shares is a painful place in Palola for the STTK Office.
The system requires that the government be revoked on a legal law which would be implemented by part of the clergy.
According to the STTK, we do not conclude that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP.
The salaryers will be gathered on Monday, Helsinki, to oppose the counterparty of work in the last week of the government.
The packaging payment of the first diseases is cut off, overwork resets are settled, sun sunrises are reduced to 75% and the leakage is delayed.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have called for payers to the publication and that they did not have an organizational law.
Akavan Führer's thanks
Academy President Sture Führer thanks to the notification of STTK for the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Führer, the STTK will now be the same line with Akawa, as Akava has already been the most important optional models for the Government's representatives.
Fjeder hopes that SAK is also obtained as an alternative to be packaged, as without the SAK package is not sufficient to cover.
President Sture Fäder hopes that, according to the future, the SAK leader of Lauri Lyly to prepare a presentation for an alternative for operations.
Antti Palolan STTK told his new proposals in the middle of the week.
We want to change the security and worktime banks.
The open week has already been prepared for its own presentation, which is ready to consult the Government of the country as an alternative for operational transactions.
Akava has been ready to consult all the time, and we have already written alternative models for the Government's presentations.
We're ready to look at the conditions of the service relationship in particular.
In response, we want to change the security and worktime banks, reports President Sture Führer.
Fjeder hopes that also SAK will be on Akava lines, as previously done by STTK.
Without the SAK package, it is not sufficiently strong.
Now, we're preparing a model that comes to the government and workers of the country, Führer says.
The Labour Committee shall be meeting at 15 p.m. on the possible content of the Agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously maintained the exemptions during the Middle East and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipihu speaks very exceptionally to the people of the Finnish economy at 21.05 p.m.
In 1932, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding a famous radio call, which means the start of the end of the Malean ship.
Then the President and the ministers had several radio calls during the winter and the continued war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho took President Mauno Koviston instead of the new year, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Chinan stopped the telephone.
A single call, a monarchist mine
The civilian speech has risen on the criticism of the whole day and the consideration of what will be expected.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmaki said: "It could be able to keep Sipira speaking on the state of the country as an advertising of the Secretary-General in which we would also be able to discuss the conversation."
According to the Green Vive, "unit has already been seen.
The leadership belongs to dialogue, listening to people.
In Facebook, the SDP's Courts condemned that "monarchist's monarchists: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, argued on the Sipil dialogue: "For some half years, it has been shocked.
There is no preceding appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with opposition.
It's tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid?
Public Service
According to the State Council, the Cyprus speech has been shocked and sustained for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented on President Lauri Lyly and the Executive Director of the EC Jyri Headman on a large basis.
It has been generally estimated to present Sipil's speech.
We hoped this and we found that it was the task of the public service to promote all the Finnish publicity, the line of the Yle Director of Publications, Ismo Silvo Yen, in the news.
Like us at the time of the Temple
The conversation has also been shocked.
Tonight, you'll be enjoyed at a good time, kids are shocked, and they're shooting better.
Mom puts his head the sight's trick and his dad agrees with the snare of the salmon.
From nine hours, it is quiet to television as before me at the time of the Tamelo," writes bloggari Saku Timone.
"Does the Prime Minister Sippia also discuss the reason why the Finnish government sits in the taxpayer capitals, which put to other arms laws of taxi partners, and claim to the people that it must be shocked when the State has the end of money?" asked Pia Lohikoski.

Atheist in Guardian: Western countries against Russia's proposal on the exclusion of Al-Assad
The Western countries have been fighting for more than three years ago the offer of Russian President Bashar al-Assad that would have been obtained from the power, reports President Martti Athesaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisar, the Russian United Nations flow proposed a plan which would have been slowly struck by the Al-Assad for a while.
However, the Western countries did not have the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad was falling in a few weeks.
The Agency discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
According to Ahtisar, Russian Senator Vitali Tshurk, in the two-second debate, held him a three-line plan: the opposition between weapons, opposition and al-Assad had to immediately reach contacts with the authority of Al-Assad.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily have the same agreement, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told her what I've done there and he said that Alas, Marty, is sit down, so I'm gonna tell you what we have to do, and the Aasisar remembers Guardian's debate.
Diplomatics do not comment
The expert reports the Chukin message to the United States, the United States and the French, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisar says that there are no two words.
The United Nations diplomates also refused to comment on Ahtisar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already done several of the murders and the main opposition groups for which he had remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle Eastern Department, is addressed to the affronts of Ahtisar, because his experience said that Russia had never been ready to discuss Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assadia throughout the war.
In the same way, Achistorian claims that Tshurk spoke about the Moscow’s government.
If he had told me of the Tshurkin talk, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin to take it seriously.
Jenkins stated that in that case, he would be suspected that Putin had been the favorite of maintaining the power of some Al-Assad supporter.
The shipment of our own works
During the theatre negotiations, about 7500 people died during the Syrian crisis.
According to the United Nations argued, the number of victims of death exceeded 2200,000 in the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been flying from their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I don't see any other option than bearing good care of these humans.
Now, we'll pay the account we've caused now, and Athesaari says to the newspaper.
Securities applicants' arrangement center in the Toronto
The Centre of Planning of North Summit Secure applicationers is likely to be established to Tornio.
The debate would be based on the construction of the Tornion community in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Inlands has searched for an appropriate place to improve the control of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsinki’s news was found that the department had already decided to present school construction decisions to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppis (see).
When the entire delegation was not on the coast and was part of the portuguese decision, we decided to call the delegation's meeting on the next Monday to decide on this matter, he expresses the STT.
There were 36 delegates in the debate states of 43.
The Headquarters opposed 13 delegated.
It could be expected that the decision would be positive, and it is said.
According to Timo Nevayaze, the city was communicated as an unrelated Sunday, and soon it was reacted.
The Community would be possible for assessing 500 safe site applications once.
The expert has been examined that it could be appropriate to this use.
The location is just a few meters from the border, so it would also be active, older.
Cyclopedia is still hoped to alternate on the working market for churches
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (C.) the public was to defeat vacances only to handle a part of the government's aim to calculate the cost of work.
However, the Government is deeming to take a optional package if the social organizations are able to agree.
In the committee, Sipila reported that he had not been linked to the working market organizations.
He also did not know how serious organizations are looking for a way to replace the ways for the churches of life in the government reported.
If a such agreement is born, we will take it without any other joy with a whole package.
The defence of loans would be the way of Cyprus operating because it was almost all payers other than the operation of the government's Sunday.
Employment organizations could, among them, agree on the operation of salary funds, as they have been registered in place of law on employment contracts.
The Government reports these visions as a mid-week to the committee of the churches of life in life as a communication of the State Council.
The proposals of organizations should be informed before.
This isn't the finish shop.
Legislative work is going to move, or swimming, and it's going to be harder for the whole time.
It's a good time now.
So there is no long way in these things, if you want to do so, Sippia's shape.
In the last week, the list of governments has, in other words, a change of final and helmet to free-term work time without delay.
Furthermore, the payment of the first diseases is shocked, the overwork reparations are settled, the sunfall costs are reduced to 75% and the losses are decreased.
Reforms will be implemented as a forced decrease in the end of the vocational associations, which has been renewed by a strong view.
The Ombudsman Centres organize action on Wednesday, as well as a number of professionals have declared political laws.
The Delegation of Ministers adopted the expansion of the stock of the magistrates
The Delegation of Ministers agreed unilaterally but a few of the North Koivu Oy controls, or the expansion of the stock of the magic.
Assessment caused the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than the beginning had been spoken.
Even the urgent timetable was shocked.
It was a little surprising that the status needs were not informed over the previous expansion.
In this stage, the expansion of the stock was approved to an investment programme of 400-450 square meters, but the money will be decisively decided in the context of the participatory report.
There were also 1500,000-200 000 euro investments in the presentation list, but the technical director Erkki Ikone reported that the price will be estimated for EUR 3000,000.
Investment was encouraged by providing work and taxes to the location.
The honor has no risk, since the company pays the investment switch, the Water Division (s.p.) founded.
Turn to language in Joensu
The commercial management of your shipment is previously cut into its position to produce carriage channel names in Joensua.
The new decision is important and right in the whole country.
Joensuu will not be proclaimed as the capital of the language, because there are no historical reasons and no switch language is a creative part of the identification of the region.
The language speaking on the street of Joensue has been more part of the western slaughter.
After a new decision, the centre of the city will not be swimming language channels.
However, the city of Joensu is possiblely well-being also ready to use a swimming language, for example, in the information tables and on the market.
Similarly, the city is recommended for all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a single language group, it also supports the use of the language openly now when multicultural diversity lives and is strongly changed in Northern Karjala.
The language is still the special aspects of the country, as well as the picture of Joensu, the whole city of the Finnish forest capital.
Each of them can be very useful for the multi-markting markets.
The slowness of the good connections slows the power of the country
The transactions of the Junction Contacts are attacked by a strong hand of the country’s life force.
Movement contacts directly affect the field animals and the competitiveness of the country.
And it affects whether we can overcome the life and work here, President of the city of Joensue, Kari Karja's miracle.
He also puts out an aircraft, which has also continued to be taken in the report.
It is important for the whole country that our possibilities are not to reduce state power measures as we have now.
The Caribbean should consider the impacts of these transactions, for example, on employment, which are stressed.
The inadequacy of communications causes additional challenges to the East Soome University.
Indeed, what best services are here, such as business and home conditions, it is easier to get students and employees, director of the East Summit University.
He emphasizes that bad traffic connections also affect the research, which is very moved and traveling because of a lot of research.
Marko Junkkarin said that the marketing of the university at the present time is difficult, because the traffic connections are weak in the university.
At this moment, about half of the students of Eastern Soome University come out outside the East Suma.
Again, about 10-20% of them is the New Year, which is explained in part in the line of free contact.
Joensue became one of my shoes to the war of Siu.
The view of the country's war project of Joensue is apparently unilateral, but one of the spectacles is also in the group.
Mr Pentti Centralsallo (s. image) presented a government on the whole project, but its proposal was unfavourable.
The government adopted the President of the city's resolution, Kari Karja, which is still amended at the beginning of October before the meeting of the Cities's delegation, which gives the project a final opinion at the same time with all other chairs.
One winter from Home to Kouvo will end next year
Your personal work from the Coast to Kouvo remains even in the future, although one slower swimming pool.
In March, there will be changes between Kotka and Kuuvola.
One of the swimming couples stays away, but five times in the day, you'll go from home to the Coast and to the back.
The claims are due to the State restraint operations.
The financing for the shipping and the Communication Ministry for the next fourth year reduces EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped in total.
The VR will prepare new temporary tables until the end of the year.
They take into force 27.3.2016.
The kids kicked into the castle, one didn't go down, the boys lifted out of the place
The Saviation Unit left a swimming stone to a 12-year-old age that was not open from the castle.
Your condition was born in Tornion, Ketoti, half the eighth night.
There is an old wood of twice wood where there are no threads in the bowl.
It did not prevent a child who decided to switch up the castle of the house on his side of the radioamers.
The other kids got the same way down, but one didn't.
As a result, others switched the place and the drivers to the place of the Savior Office to help the latter shops to be safely restored on the ground.
FedEx's business fleet is two, calculate the visions of the 2016 year
FedEx reported disadvantaged results from the last quarter, and the delivery switched the whole yearly resulting test, as a result of the deterioration of the reporting services and the higher costs of its rural services.
The company also said that it would be paid for about 55.000 sequencies at the time of the leisure.
In the past year, FedEx reported that it will be rewarded by 500,000 sex-sexercise operators for the time of the departments.
The share of its share was around 2,5 % of the expenditure for 45 minutes prior to the mid-week.
FedEx Corp says that it will wait for the next end of May for 10,40-10,90 $, which is 20 cents lower than previous prophecy.
Analytics waited for $10.84.

The movement increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
In the question of Zacks, six analysis expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years of reducing international priority transport, which has stopped its development of the Express Trading Unit.
However, the increase in the network trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the latest fourth country trade change increased 29 per cent, but the results of the operations were in principle the same because of the expenditure and the insurance of the most largest packages.
Income of the Express unit was better because of the higher base payments, when the higher working costs in the financing operations were recovered.
Accommodation passing about an hour before FedEx's shares are counted by $3,85 or $2.5 per cent to $ 150.15.

On the other hand, the central bank is a double meeting room from the United States.
The map is remindered that President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must set up the economic interests of the people in all other ways.
The Congress has been calculated by the Central Bank for two responsibilities: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep the prices seriously.
However, after the largest floor, the leaders of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third, unscribed mandate: economic stability.
The third requirement may be a decisive factor in the public decision which is so strict that it may not even be predicted. The decision is whether the USA's economic financing is prepared to be the evaluation of the estimated rate of the remaining short-term rate for the end of 2008 to the end of 2008 .
Although the largest part of the information shows that the economic growth is stable, the latest death on the global financial market may have already been made by the officials of the central banks in front of the most slowest degree that will be to increase in stability, and it is fearing how it would affect if the fund rate of the United States would even be tested in the fourth percentage units.
"Only understanding the labour markets and inflation are the first and most important things that are followed," states Lindsey M. Piegza, minental reporter of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But if they are looking for the right to leave the rate, increased insecurity on the world market is sufficiently able to expect the right,” said he.
The decision of the Central Bank is not reaching a common understanding, which somehow generates nervousness in the economy.
According to the outcome study of Bloomberg, about half of the economic reporters predicts that the rate is higher in this week.
Financial markets are still expected that the Central Bank will be delayed, as the main indicator states that the possibility of growth is only 30 %.
This refers to the calculation of the values market if the Central Bank increases the level, unless the principals would then be able to shoot the shooting by promising that the next rate will not occur in the next few years.
In time, Dow Jones industry average - the index increased 228.89 points, that is 1,4%, the new chapter 16.599.85.
It is expected that the Central Bank holds the level before this week, reports John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group reporter.
"I'm surprising if the Central Bank gets up the heights right now," he says.
If the heads highlight the heights, "we must see much difficult in their line to support the financial markets so that they are not in the panic."
Other experts claim that the global level would calm the financial markets because it would remove the incertitude of when the Central Bank operates.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank would affect the rate of the four-percentage unit in this month, thus taking the first small step towards the situation of the money-based situation, which would ensure the stability of the United States.
In general, it has been said that it is expected to increase the level this year, despite the need for liberals in its choices to increase economic development.
Although the creation of new jobs was long in August, the growth in the labour market has been stabilized this year.
In the last month, unemployment rate was at 5,1 per cent, which is a seven-year-old and near the level of the Central Bank to be the full-scale limit.
The growth of the wages has proved to be marked in the decline.
Although inflation is still under the two-year objective of the Central Bank, it has significantly affected the price of the olive oil.
The economic "speaks the higher rates and also needs to take into account the strict situation of the labour markets", states Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China deserved its riches.
Dow Jones in the industry - index even 16 per cent of its mixture, when investors feared that China’s long-term economic growth was also a global growth.
The markets have reached some amount in this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 % below the mixture.
The balance of the markets in the central bank is an additional compliance with a complex balance, which tells us that higher rates should be higher.
"Unless these events of the financial market and the last weeks news on the weakness of China's economy, the chiefs would explain the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and the official of the former Central Bank.
Now he predicts that the heads will expect at least a month to have better effects of view.
"My effects for the United States economy are particularly uncertain, and they do not have any information on the use of what will happen to the consequences of the Chinese events," Oilner states.
The international economic well-being is not the maintenance of the central bank, so it should therefore not affect the decision.
However, in the use of the central bank of the Union, the world's money authorisation has become a worldwide.
In recent years, the impact of the Central Bank has been unplanned.
In 2013, the secular President Ben S. Bernanken rewarded that the Central Bank can "caven" increase the amount of money, caused smuggles in the world's markets.
In the world where markets and economics have continued to be borrowed together, the Central Bank officials are expected to be on the other hand, also consulting other central banks and experts to get better view of the world's economy.
The bank's decision-making process is "better art than knowledge", states Zachary Karabell, Head of the World Strategy of Investet Inc.
The Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Bank) of the Virginia State in Richmond, President Jeffrey Lacker noted in this month that “the Central Bank has previously overregourned its financial market trade, which has affected the different fundamental factors of the economy”.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has decided, has requested an impact, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, is a example of decisions between 1998 and 99.
The Asian economic crisis caused a reference value of 0.75 per cent during the three meetings "in spite of the limited and identifiable effects of the United States economic growth", Lacker says.
Any years later, the Central Bank shocked these operations.
The bank also should set an economic stability to the economic priority only during the large crisis, as markets destroyed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the former members of the Highlight Committee of the Bank (Bank of England).
The latter myerry will not be close to its level, Posen states.
"No one wants to do a situation in which the rates are scared because the markets are corrupt," said Peterson Institute for International Economics President Posen.
The law of the Member State on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) still remains to be included in two requirements and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is, they do not think that it should be prevented.

Brazilian childhood organization Rio Grande reports healthy food options for medicators
SPRS has developed a way of shokeering in Brazil to try to understand the importance of good food as a birthday by publishing pictures of birth skin skins that have a landmarked description of unsafe food.
It consists of various proteins, grains, vitamins and hydrohydrates that give the babys all necessary nutrients to develop a strong immune system.
Women and new mothers who are pregnant need additional energy, so they are advised to increase daily colour of about 500 fish.
However, a new study shows that the increase in the quantity of calories is not the only food change that the mother should do.
Technical Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy food capacity for women who are pregnant itself affects their child’s genetic appearance and protects children from the development of growth.
Unfortunately, an insufficient nutritional system was observed negatively on the immune system of children.

4 death in the shooting of the police in Nepal

Poverty has occurred in the region of Rupandeh in about 175 mails from the west city of Katmand.

Pharmaceutical treatment may help to be excessively excessive of diabetes
According to a new study, the benefits of the 2-food diabetics of the types of bleeding may be at least five years.
However, it is still too premature to say if these lives are too slowly slowly diagnostics after the skinning processing than those treated in other ways than in the surgery.
“The receipt of mortality data is long,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone.
In the barrier operations, different methods are used to reduce the skin.
They reduce hunger and restrict food inhibition.
In years, bariat operations have been effectively identified for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of those involved in the study have been hospitally meat, and their pressure index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the MIB is over 25, it shows that somebody is over pressure, and if the MI is over 30, it is considered to be excessive.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new research, researchers in the Mexican Min-Sheng General Hospital hospital used from 2007 to compare two barriers surgery surgery operations, and reducing the labour medication, the type 2-diabetes medicational treatments for persons who were extremely excessive.
The survey showed that the average BMI of operational persons ranged from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the five years.
At the same time, BMI remained the largest dimension of those treated by other methods as in the operations 29.
With 36 percent of the heavy people, diabetes improved totally and 28 percent in part.
As a result of comparison, in the medically treated group diabetes improved only by 1 per cent and by some 2 per cent.
Furthermore, blood pressure, triglyserides and "peor" LDL colleagues "was generally taking the best surgery group", writers explained.
Studiers also followed hemoglobin A1c percentages of patients who reflected blood sugar in a long time.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain in less than 7 per cent, which writes researchers.
The rate of hemoglobin A1c post-operation was around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the medicine group, it remained stabil in about 8 percent.
However, this best "glycale control" which has improved hemoglobin A1c has not reduced mortality during five years, reports to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu collegone.
The research group also compared the average results between two different types of operation.
In the five-year terms, when compared with the group in the slow-sized skin, the group in the slow-screening process had been declined more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), hemoglobin A1c was more (3,1 % and 2,1 %), and the total diabetes remission (46,9 % and 16,7 %).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix's Blackstone says that, although the study does not appear a life or an operation after five years, there are studies on Swedish, where the surgery has led to a deepest life with humans.
In the Swedish study, 29% of the sweet cases were less likely to die in 15 years when they were compared to a group that had experienced the most traditional treatment framework.
Although a new study does not seem to improve the life of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are, however, encouraged for persons under 35 BMI, who are interested in the operation.
"Attention results are just resolved by showing that transaction is safe to the group of low pressure indexes", and does not engage in the risk of death or renal disease, he says.
More than Blackstone, both patients and their physicians should take a very serious weight at the stage when BMI is 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that constantly prepare his body for excessiveness and diabetes, the elimination of the situation is very difficult.
"All can't come to Europe." Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe can't accept any further refugees that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found from the Middle East.
The Director of Budgetary Chief has requested the stop of violence in the homes of refugees.
Dalai Lama was discussed in his speaking of refugees in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the British visit.
Dalai Lama said that in the current situation, all humankind needs should be set up by individual nations or even before the earth.
He also stressed that although the response to the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not sufficient.
"All can't come to Europe," he said when he talked.
Although Dalai Lama exceeded the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that there is only a timely solution.
"It's wonderful to take care of several thousands of refugees, but it must be considered long-term solutions: how to produce real peace and real development through education.
The most important thing is to consider how we can reduce the killing of their country.
We have to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
On the basis of the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and said that the United States's violence responded to the rail events.
"After the 9/11, I submitted a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the solution to this problem is to be found through violence.
I know that his motive was good, but he used strength and it took unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the past four years, the inhibition of children’s processing substances has increased into negonality.
In other parts of the United States, the drug information centres have reported about nearly 400% of the increase in alcoholic manipulation substances after children under 12 years of age, reports Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia Medical Medical Medical Medical Medical Informations reported on desinfying substances under 12 years of age increased from 3266 cases in 2014 in 16117.
"Kinds are interested in these products more often and slowly certain percentages of them are able to cope", reported Lopez to the CNN.
He said that some children drink the desinfying substance with a purpose when some want to make an impact on their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where teenagers drink desinfying substances to obtain a delicate increase in the area.
According to reports, desinfying substances have been desinfected to alcoholic sweet to get more stronger drink.
The desinfying products of desinfying substances may affect younger children.
"The child doesn't think it's bad about him," said Lopez.
Many of the most interesting (cameras) are those that have been added.
There are substances of desinfectization that are very attractive in the mind of children.
The desinfiation substance may contain alcohol from any 45 to 95 per cent.
In particular, small children are needed only a few skins for alcoholic abuse.
"It's a very intensive alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Medical Medical Information Medical Information Administration, reported to Fox 4: in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the visa to shoot on the table, but the hand-infination substance will be left to see, and if children are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl, who just a few years ago shooted four skins of desinfying materials in the school, and was carried it to the first tree.
His blood alcohol was .179, which is two times higher than adult rats juice, tells Dr. Chris Ritchey, who managed the girl in the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was able to walk when he arrived in the first tree.
The doctors followed him the night in a different hospital of children with potential brain diseases, as alcohol was cut off and shooted with her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really terrified," Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
You might have killed my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use unalcoholed products or desinfiation requests and transfer from desinfying substances from children.
In addition to alcohol drugs, some desinfects have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died with a desinflation substance that contains an unreported substance.
Health authorities understood that the product contains methane, killing substance, nor ethyl alcohol that had been reported as an active substance.
In January, in the northern state of New York, three fourth classs planned to be terrorized by promoting bacteria drugs to the classroom, the police report was reported.
The teacher is very allergic to the desinfiation substance, and it was a language with its creation.
The police must prevent the plan as a "comfortable smuggling" and leave the routine action to the schools.

Scotland unemployment remains the same when the total number of Iso-Britannia increases
RECAUTIONS in Scotia remained between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom increased 100,000 people in total 1,82 million.
Skotland unemployment rate 5,9% is higher than 5,5% in the United Kingdom, the National Statistics (UNS) chapters.

During these 12 months, Scotland labour markets have improved, unemployment has increased and unemployment has been calculated.
Why I'm at Oklaho?
If no legal income will be occurred, I'll see today when a man is engaged.
If that happens, and I hope no, I'll sit down in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison in Oklahoma State when Richard Glossip is slaughtered in the murdering shoes.
He has asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses of his death.
In January, I responded to the request by means of his best friend, and even though I was confused, I agreed.
I've started to smell this day.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the death penalty all the story.
It would offer a unique view.
Indeed, the employees have the possibility of monitoring distortions in the United States, and because the applications are often more than free places, the participants are selected through a tragic value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places covered to the media for twelve references.
Whoever's ever chosen is looking at the event in a while.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit near the nearest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created him my own contact during my months and through one two-member visit.
I like a man.
We're often smiling when we're talking about it.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a Witness and a supplier, so I should not have a record and a cry to save my view.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A Western supplier accused of the Twitter that I had cut off my independence.
Here's a teaching.
Tell the prison story that she wants, so you're gonna get to participate.
I chose to the delivery.
I agree that you could have made it better, but it is still agreed that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip was different with some of my words and my writing things.
She doesn't tell me what I should write, and I wouldn't do so even if he'd say.
I told her that he can't remove me from the Witness list.
But he wants that there is an international translator who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity helps the opposite direction of death penalty.
Huffington's reporter Kim Bellware is near me.
If you want to know more about the conversation, you can listen to my series of podcast expenses.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Treese, they would have made him a guilty.
But I think it's a very strong chance of not being guilty of the murder.
I certainly believe that the legal proof of death penalty was not enough.
I think it's wrong.
And so this is the point of view that I'm looking at him to die.
I can't say that I'm completely indefensive.
There will be other providers that take care of it.
I'm going to get a description of what feels like when a man I like is going to die unnecessaryly.
The man was shocked away from the Canning River after a smooth police team.
Canning Vale's officer remained in a shock when he shocked a man out of the Canning River.
From Perth's home, a man's company shut up the police's smiling goes out when he found himself out of the shooting water, only in the midst of the police that tried to "beat him back to the beach."
The Canning Vale Police was called to Beckenham for an unlawful incentive.
When they found a doubt, they tried to shoot them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get too long.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not going to go, get me." Says the older Super-Starryer Shandell Castledine.
The officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to grow up, so he used a more safeer tactic: "I think about the police reconstruction."
" Sometimes people do a deceit when trying to escape," said the parent superstar Castledine.
Major Power Ben Cousins is an example of thinking.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to avoid corruption and tried to take Swan River's joy over.
He didn't have succeeded in his company, but inspired locally to start playing a player Ben Cousins - Biothlon design.
Peter Moody claims to be stable to the employees and threatens to stop competitiveness.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's employees have been able to solve his stability on his stories last year, and it threatens to stop competitively.
He accused of officials and Racing Victoria’s donor insurance by claiming that they have a personal campaign in the starting of him. In the middle week, the late delay of Lady Tata was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been doing what is the best competitive and that he has reached a difficult situation in the unexpected positive cobaltment of Lidar.
He had had a language in the course of stakeholders for a half years, and he didn't want to say "that would seem to be deceased."
"I didn't have to say anything, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so smelling that all the things are shocked once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes it must only react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk in the ability and I want the owners to think I'll do my best before them.
When they're starting to think to each other, I don't have to continue as a trainer.
Then I should consider what I'm doing to my license.
Before Moody hit the bomb in the Racing.com site in which he told you that the unschentable department had tried to switch his tas.
"Third years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sit in the room with a man, I'm named him as a question, and they offered him to work with my store if she's interesting in what I'm doing there.
They're clearly like me as a sweet.
If that's so, they'd like to disappear their lawyer, because they've failed to do my catch.
Robert Roulston, Racing Victoria's former President, David Moodie, Racing Victoria’s current president, and Bernard Saundry, the current director of the Victoria, were all learning about this at that time and are finding it today.
Should I start thinking that this is about personality?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to be a man and may be able to move the responsibility to others other than trainingers?
I'm in the field?
I'm so ridiculous in the field?
Maybe people think that.
Maybe they must take my license and work me into discrimination, and I don't doubt if the matter that I say may have to be able to think about it right now.
But I'm on that point now, I'm not worried anymore, and it's gonna hurt me.
It really hurts me.
I regret them to make a decision which is responsible for them.
I have my family support, and I can translate my way to this.
The deterioration of the training has increased in the late long-term cobalt study of Lidar, and the late abandonment was to state that it could “stand its license over the table”.
Moody, who is known for the training of Black Caviar, has called the rules on the treatment of the jumpday, as a result of the "related" procedure after the swimming or swimming smells of the horses of the horses, which is unregular.
"It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility of it," he said.
One of my employees was in the wrong case to change his feet.
That could have been a sweet last night.
That could have been it yesterday, like it was.
It was on the lunch day.
Moody may have a prohibition of competitiveness for three months because of the treatment of the latter day which the employees started the study.
It's ridiculous.
People who put these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has been too long." Moody said.
In Cobram, a convicted driver was arrested
The police's arrested a man who was accused of being slaughtered in a weekend in Cobram.
The trainer was transported in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Hospital, when the car slaughter slaughter slaughtered to him on the lunch of Murray Valley on Monday.
The police said that the driver had gone and he wasn't stopped to help the fertilized driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was reported to the police in Shepparton.
It will be accused of stopping the accident, the distortion of the aid and other transport systems.
The trainer, a 40-year-old man Cobramis, is still in the hospital, and his situation is stable.
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in presses
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-runbyliga matrimonial claims that his teams would be part of the "transmission".
Sydney Roosters trainer Trent Robinson said the "Prine" of the separate matrix Storm on his side when it surprisingly wins the final breakfast in Sydney on Wednesday evening.
Brisbane Broncos, Fabricant Wayne Bennett, often slaughtered with a reference to Stormi after he wined North Queensland Cowboys on the finish kitchen. Bennett called the game as a "view window" and said that two teams of Queensland would not be the "speaked" pressure.
Bellamy defended his team's hands and said they only focused on contacts.
Bellamy adds that his confidence adds two trainers toward Storm, as it means that they fear the loss of the team.
"This will always be a conversation... I didn't hear about Trent Robinson's pressure when we lost 24-2," Bellamy said in the middle week.
I can see that we haven't changed anything in our defence system or in our technology all year, and in the last six weeks we've just pushed contacts, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in the team three years, and she seems to have a great team to train, so he's probably not able to lose, and this had a little reason for him.
Hass the way this will always be talking about this year.
Bellamy deceived Bennett's thinking of "smiling rumby" by recalling his mentor that the trainer of St George Illawarra Dragons wins the mastery in 2010 by playing "this."
Wayne's talking about a shocking rushby.
She had had to compare the game on Tuesday night on our lunch night and tell us how depressing their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was criticized often by the fact that it is a stupid team, and Wayne said that it could not be less interested.
But now, he has a team that can play a ruby that we love, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have the types of players.
He took it in the middle of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his sweet rumby - not who's in the team friends such as Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, to play so.
I'll be more reliable when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think we were opposed to the most important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roostersi was more potter than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly good game, I didn't see it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
We had a 20-18 game, so we had two more lands, but is it a weird ruby?
Or is it the crime of the defence line and the defence of the land?
It's about lines for me.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them.
Stomer has a free for this weekend, because they've already winned home games to North Queensland Cowbosses or to Chronella Sharks's pre-finishing night at AAMI Park. Lips will come to sale on the next evening.
Serbian $2000,000 for drug reasons
A man who threatens the possibility of living in Queensland from the 40-hour cocaine-kill management company, has been released against $200,000.
Marko Macsmovic, a 29-year-old man, was one of the five men who was arrested last month after the police of the United States had posted 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay Jaid that came through South America through Vanuatu, and was held in August in Coomerya.
Maksmovic was seen to see others who were accused of a boat all morning, and then he met them in the coffee of Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs from the Toyota Echo car.
Although Macsmovicia threatens its potential life-based business from the amount of cocaine management company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Macsmoviz tried to keep the entire amount in its control, and that he could be fully free of coffee.
The Supreme Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned about the attempt to escape.
"Hither has strict contacts to Serbia.
He's traveling to Serbia often," she told the court in a half week.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximov lied to the police from the place where he lived.
Maksmovic’s mother and father’s parents were together offering $2000,000 to ensure his release.
"I congratulate the light certificates of both persons, it is clear that the setting of $2000,000 is a real economic race to them", said the judge Flanagan.
But only it was not enough to prevent him to be unexpected to justice, he warned.
Maksimov was granted in the condition that it should be resigned as an Australian and Serbian passenger, each day the police will be informed and holded on the foreign provision between the night and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to shoot pedofils to send pictures
Pedofil used a 11-year-old phone to request images for children's use.
Stevan Hogg took a girl in bed with this phone and then registered into the network message service where Hogg received several photos of the children who sent him to the other user.
The girl laughed later, noted that the phone was lost and found it on the hand of Hoggi's sleeping.
The girl investigated his phone and found a disappointed message, after which she immediately told his mother about it.
When the police came, he saw five pictures, investigated the computers on the site, and found the network requests for applications that had been used to search for the images of untrained swimming children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to shoot pedofils" on the Internet before he said "he would be the police to fear them."
Mrs Eilidh Robertson reported to the Dundeen Sheriff Court Court of Justice: "He said that there is an advisory that he is depending on the fear of people.
He agreed that he had performed the top computer, but he said that it was only because he wanted to do his police so that he could shoot pedofils.
She was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent his pictures, and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said that he only did this in the kitchen.
He said he'd have to get sick, and he wants to look at the pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures of his phone, she shouted his mother, your skin and smile.
Mom saw the sweet pictures on the phone, and then he met the accused.
She was discussed, and she told him that he was accused of using computers and Playstation to talk to her girls who were more young.
Ward Road in Dunde, 23-year-old Hogg acknowledged the accused of preparing or taking photos of unlawful children on June 14, last 14, and violated this year and left the Court of Justice on 24 March this year.
The politician Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia would not be a sexual register, since it could be claimed that he wasn't belonging to “the important sexual elements of his crime”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has sentenced in October, so that the social office has time to prepare background reports.
It was granted to Hoggi in this case, but in other cases he has been arrested before the process was processed.
He was added to sexual crime records before the date of sentence.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe took a false talk to Parliament
Mugabe's older leader in Africa has fallen before the doors of the talking period this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video described on the shooting has spread the virus in social media.
The opening of the Parliament also states that the lawyers had been sent to them unnome death situations in which they were warned to be swallowed to Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they buried and stopped him with interviews while holding a conversation on the state of the country to Parliament - which speech he repeated.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) controller of the Group Force in Innocent Gone said to his seven opposite policy telephones text messages that were warned to them about the angry of Mugabe.
"Nume from which the message was sent is not answered, but the title of the message is dead", said Gonnes to the suppliers after the conversation of Mugabe.
The message was warned by the Members concerned that the deficiency ends in Parliament, and when they are out, Parliamentary unity is not possible.
The supervisory of the group said that the party, leading to Morgan Tsvangirai, is about the threat of the threats against its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has been expected to operate 25 000-30 000 jobs in its reorganization and consumption processes in business services.
In the later year, HP will divide two post-listed enterprises by separating the more rapidly increased business instruments and services of their computer and printing transactions.
The expected job operations are based on about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth fourth, as stated in the HP information.
"This restructuring measures will enable the new more competitive and sustainable consumer structure to Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, President of the HP and Director of Agency, which leads to the unit after the post.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we must have wide and deeply selected services that help firms to move into the new business", said Whitman.
As a particular company, our possibility to respond to the needs developed by our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than 50 billion dollars annual business, and it is "deceptive to produce integrations from its comparison with the technological structures" to the companies, in the information of the company.
The firm that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard had prepared from Stanford University University in the 1930s to prepare electrical needs. The company operates in the car rental named Pallo Alt, which is called "The birth of the Pilatus".
HP has been using a significant reorganisation to detect the transition of traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technologie companies in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector, based on the faith that strictly limited enterprises will be better performed.
Archenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team friends have to support the fervent Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb game
Wenger has also stressed Wilshir that now is just September and that he's planning according to the plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't go back to Christmas again.
Even in this best case, Wilshir remains at least four of the next English games, and when we take into account his background, it is uncertain if he participates in European masterships.
The biggest regret in this last problem is that Wilshere was the end of the last few years to be stronger after the individual swimming, and he remembered the old skin before the beginning of the years.
"This isn't threatening urine," Wenger said.
It's the belief that didn't have been improved with honor.
It's not awesome.
It was just an accident.
It doesn't connect to his necks, or any more weaknesses that he had.
This may take place from the medical view, but, as well as Wenger, the attempt to play through the back has always been the most important risk.
Adjustment has also an inadequate model.
First Injuries Ltd’s research shows that Wilsher had 23 different weaknesses after he debited six years ago.
Furthermore, in the past five years, he has played 157 liga games only in 65 games.
In view of the increased totality of Arsenal since 2007 to 08, it had been one of the Varioliigan teams who had lost the most days because of the poor.
Wenger admits the possibility of wednesday, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in the last few years continues.
"If you get back from the skin may be a long time when you have to strengthen the body and buy competition," Wenger said.
Jack's enough young enough to get out of it.
I hope that his body is stable, I'm sure that it's going to be, and that he's got to be made a torch as he's worthy.
Wenger is prepared to run his team when Arsenal starts his lyrics game in the middle of the week before the Dinamo Zagrebia I played after Sunday after Chelsea and the next half-week against Tottenham Hotspuria.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey haven't traveled to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arta are probably in the start.
Wenger can also set Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Aftero Monreal and Theo Walcotti.
"I'm trying to hold up the balance and to give the breath to the skilled players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continued piece of F, the Maximir station in Zagreb is the most fearful European.
Dinamo also has not been lost in 41 battles after they produced their own "unfortunate" campaign in the past few years.
Stadion was shocked at the night of a slaughter that was the power of 3,2 judges.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has been learning for the last few years of dedication of the Messiah to Monaco, and he has caused a far-larged hair to lead the team to the winning of its first European cups.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
The Arsenal has never reached it.
We were very close to 2006, but, on the other hand, we were realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not a dealer.
FriendsFest: Comedia series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It's very slightly how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially when considering the need for men to open the need to be worse than ever, and the numbers of young men's self-assault by higher than for a reference year.
In 2013 the suicide was the largest cause of death in men between 20 and 45 years of age in Britain, and it is three times more common than women.
In the company's problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) reported the men in 2015. The goal was to challenge the culture that prevent men from seeing help if necessary.
A friendship is in a position to face this challenge.
In this study, more than 2000 students of high school and classic students were shown in massus, and a study states that the person’s possibility to get two times, if sufficiently higher percentage of his friends had been "healthly minded".
Similarly, those who did not have the probability of exposure of potential mental health problems faced if they thought that they were healthy friends.
But so that friendship can work, it must first be available.
In this social media, the style of the style ends to the content and the interface of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to affect strong, happy and successfully, although in fact the diversity is dominated.
The values that psychologists call for outside: money, imagination, social status. All this happens in internal values - the personal growth and friendship costs that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as an milliarder of video player explained, the money really does not get greater happiness.
Frendi's greatness was just that it was translated to this focus.
I have not defined their work, but, above all, their personality, which has clearly differed as friends.
In those moments, when Joey and Chandler looked at a football, Ross’s age, these drugs came to know that yes, men can be similar to this whole, although they often suspected their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans Organization explained me: "In my month, people who are mastered and self-functioned, I really understood how small the shift effects of friend can improve the situation."
Most of us are experienced with men that they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "speaking out" is strong, as well as the feeling that if it opens the problem, we will see as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that will be in mind when I try to provide more long-term survival frameworks.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although I am an unfair, external position on the other side of the phone helps people at the moment of distress, long-term support will be close to the personal family and friends' network.
And so if you participate in the Comdy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the descriptions have been planned again for the celebration, why don't you bring your friends to the café in Central Perang?
Or what's better if you see someone in Starbucks?
You can't never know how much your friendship can be.
Frendits will be sent to Comdy at the end of the center to all 236, participating in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes it swallow and helps the PSG to heat on the Malm
Angel Di Maria celebrated Blaise Matud and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made the liga debite of the matrix in helping the Swedish teams in Malmai.
Under the fight report and the reactions on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line, when Paris Saint-Germain began a liga game at the end of the 2-0-hour against Malmö in the park of the Princess.
In the debyte of the Mediterranean, the shipment of the Mediterranean was under four minutes showing the way to the French ligators, but the team slaughtered several opportunities before finally adding their fronts to Cavan’s attack in the 61th minute.
Paris, which was at the same time with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish ligamester, because the game was not only a subsequent place, but also improvement in their fourth Finnish game at the last three circles
However, although the PSG was shocked, there was no classic game in this case because the Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic slowed the place before the land and then changed from the field.
"It's not easy to win home or visit, so 2-0-five to bring problems to the opposer and seem good in statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things that we're going to have in this time", said White.
That's good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we were not able to make one or two more lands.
Ibrahimovic returned to the couple team together with three changes after left the 2--2 game in Liga 1: at the weekend of Bordeaux, but he left the Di Maria's guard in four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester from the United States in the past month, a argentian slaughter was named a man to the new level of PSG in Europe, and he proved why to drink Marco Verratt's food in the back of the Malmese defence line and then shocked the beautiful last of Johan Wiland's network.
But if someone was waiting for PSG's easier and great winning, he was going to be disappointed.
In the Celticin negotiations, the Malmoo was a nine international player and a visa defence and two players in a deep centre.
But the team didn't offer any other attack than Nicola Djurdjicin's 34-minute shooting, which went through the shooter of Kevin Trappi.
Instead, the PSG came between the shocked food and the bad latter, especially from Ibrahimovic, which in the five enterprises had failed only to be the first side and after that Cavani put the ball into the counterparty of Ibrahimovic immediately on the beginning of another side.
However, he was much more efficient when he was making a presentation to his colleagues, and just from Ibrahimovic’s eating Di Maria sent the trip to a round pocket that spended around 52 minutes in Wiland’s landscape.
At the end of an hour, the second was able to play the sixth uruguay Cavan after Ibrahimovic had seen the left slaughter of Maxwell.
The hope of Malm’s back to the game, and only Wiland’s magnificent battle from David Luis had the final numbers down before the changing of Ezequiel Lavez was abandoned at the end of the game.
The trainer Age Hairede later welcomed that the PSG was the same level as his team. Norwegian said, "The last time we played with the Messiah was in December last year."
Then, we have only played the Swedish ligature that is not the same level.
It's not enough for warning negotiations.
Nostan's got to Paris.
This was a great game to them.

Matt Damon reduces the difference in the film
Matt Damon took together with Ephie Brown, an African movie filmer, where they focused on the distinction that, according to Damon, did not need to be behind the sculptures.
The shower experienced in the HBO Sunday Project Greenlight division stopped brewn in this emphasis on the need for various spectrums what will be towards the extraordinary maintenance of the selected documentation of the project.
"When we talk about the distinction, it will take into account the showers in the film, it is not a series," said Damon.
The shocked Brown reacted unfairly, the comments "Ooh! Wow. Okay," as the comments of the Martian shower left a swimming air.
Other producers Ben Afleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss a series of finalities.
"I want to encourage people to think about every driver, then, how they treat Harmony's personal defect," he said at the beginning.
It's the only dark shoes that his white partner's kicked.
The Dear White People producer requires the right to control the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio; Damon responded tightly that their guideline "this would end to give us something that we don't want".
When the debate was sent, social media shocked the comments of Damon.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger to the film entitlement by writing: "Matt Damon speaks to the only dark person who has been talking about the room and explaining the difference with him is NIIN ARE. "
After its publication, television collected over 5000 re-evolutions and 4000 loves.
The comments of Damon are part of the time in which a precarious discussion in the media will be at the front of social discussion.

First American Ninja Warrior Master crushed
Professional players and athletes, Isaac Caldier, became the first sportor who wins the American Ninja Warrior and rewarded a million dollars.
At the end of its seventh time there has never been a competitive programme that would have found all the parts of the programme.
In the last series of two men, Caldiero and Camera Geoff Britten, survived to the last round.
The last mission had a strike of about 23 meters of poverty in 30 seconds.
But Caldiero tried the challenge in three seconds more faster than that of her winner.
Caldiero gave the discussion to E! News difficultly after the winning and was still shocked on the winning of a million dollars.
"There is this wonderful thinking when I've never known or lived as up to $10,000 a year," said Isaac to E!, after his payment.
So I can't even imagine what this comes to... the inconsistence is unconscious.
The producer, Kent Weed, attended to discuss The Hollywood Reporter's financelist and why Britt isn't receiving more rewards, although he is the first competitor of all times that has been able to stop the ray.
According to rules, money goes to the most fastest person.
"If more than more people get away, money gets the one who has the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a wonderful reward and changed life, he has a great satisfaction.
I don't believe she feels beautiful because of that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have overcome him.
He's a wonderful guy and I'm good for her family.
He's his son and his wife's hero.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I am happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe I would have thought like Isaak if this would have been on the other side.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period of which descriptions will be started in rain 2016.
