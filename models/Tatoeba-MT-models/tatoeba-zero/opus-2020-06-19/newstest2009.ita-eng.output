The Praga's bourgeo at the market closure has had a negative crowd.
After the morning crown, the Borsa of Prague has restored the losses.
CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
By the beginning of Tuesday, the Borsa of Prague has returned from the crown of the day before it was almost 6%.
There's the crown of action on Wall Street behind this backup.
Thus, too, a market reaction is shown on the result of the vote of the Chamber of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the local financial sector stabilising plan.
Action crown in Asia
Thursday, the actions of the Asian Borse have lived in a dramatic crown, although the indexes, however, have later cancelled a part of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Borsa of Hong Kong during the day grew nearly 4%, but then a part of the losses was established by 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese actions to the Hong Kong's Borsa, decreased from 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shangai.
The shares in Sydney's Borsa lost more than 5%, but finally losses were 4.3%.
Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local index, dropped by 3,6%.
"The planning of salvation is uncertain, and that will influence the financial markets around the world," observed the Chief of the Hall of Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite the fact of China's part, is the financial policy alone, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
The American legislators, according to the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should return rapidly to the dialogue and adopt the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that even other countries have consequences.
American Action Strategy
The American Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (in about 12 billion Czech Koreans).
The legislators thus ignored the call of President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and would help stabilising the whole economy.
The American Actions Lunedì have lived astray, and the main indexs of the actions have registered the largest crowd over a 20th year.
The Dow Jones index decreased almost 7% and a crown of similar size has been observed last time in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but it has been seen that the legislation design was not approved, and it was fleet.
The Congress has ceased: the US government can earn $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a more broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this matter will be at the beginning of the next week..
American legislators slaughtered the glass in the dialogue on the approval of the savings plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (two 12 billion coronary).
But it's not still nice.
The representatives of the Congress should therefore define some details of the intent before publishing the final form of law and vote.
The financial support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the Chamber of Representatives.
Sunday said so to the Reuters Agency, the Chairman of the Bank and Financial Services Committee of the Barney Frank camera.
The Senate, according to some sources, could be voted about the plan probably not before Lunedì.
According to the economics, the advertising that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor to monitor the financial markets.
However, there will be a return to the reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which market aid is achieved in practice.
Paulson: the piano must be effective
"We have made a great step forward."
"We have cleared our different opinions on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," stated the Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same, the final vote may still happen in Sunday.
Delegates of the legislators gathered the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to purchase the non-profit hypothetical goods from financial companies, which bring financial companies to serious losses and risk the stability of the entire system.
"We are complementing the final plan agreement that will work and must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to take forward the reservoir plan, but I think we're there", said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly striking on the markets of actions that are slowly swallowing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement to the Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before the Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market in Lunedì after the Congress decision.
But for now it is not definitely clear when the two chambers of the United States Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations will be arrested at the last time on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next days.
But the law will still be many changes.
The total sum for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the amount of the rest of the sum when it will be the impression that the program does not execute its function, blocking the following $100 billion and after the ends of 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Even though the President can put the glass on this decision, the Congress may, however, exceed his right of vite.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the programme has been maintained, it is to get the financial to purchase the passive hypothetical values, which the price is covered because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypotheks.
"We've done everything.
The camera of representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday Act and Senate Lunedi," as stated by the Republic of Senator.
From progress in the negotiations, the American President Bush is also satisfied.
His chairman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive edge of Saturday and appreciation "the efforts of both parties to establish our financial markets and to protect our economy."
Gold parachutes restriction
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributions from losses, the closure of the reduction budget, the fraction of the financial plan.
The new law must also be limited to the so-called gold paradoxes for business leaders who participate in the programme and are creating a committee to control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard, and we have made a great step forward to the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and even for all the Americans," said Paulson.
The plan provides assistance to the home owners who have problems on payment.
The government should negotiate the new hypothetics rates that will be intended to reduce monthly expenditure on debt rates and will allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychology support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economic name of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is why we don't know how and what prices will be purchased for the problems
This will be decisive for how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government", said this week Marek for the iHNeed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week is not so essential, according to Marek.
"That's more important, it's that the representatives of the Congress have already found an agreement on support of this plan and that they baptize it soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at the most important moment, "hereinaftered Marek.
Duplex to the last blood: MP3 readers against cellulars
We'll suggest how to choose
While almost every cell phone you can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
This results clear that it's better to purchase only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for searching for an autonomous reader.
The choice depends on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you'd find a precious high quality swimming room to listen to us the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
At first, these musical products do not appear like LP and from the quality point of view for this, there is no objective reason.
However, if on your scaffles are cutting hard-rock, jazz or blues, a giant as minimum and dream it.
It also works with the portable music, namely music composed or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some, it may be unacceptable for a 8mill coron player, as well as a fan of the Pink Floyd may be hardly digs the twenty-third coffees of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
A decision is the duration of batteries.
Some high quality music readers can do much more than simply read music, but they do not even phones for wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone and send sms, you can read music and video, register both and have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palmers, you will also have a miniature computer.
It's a small miracle that no fridge can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The university of the cellular also causes disvantages.
More functions you are used on the cell and first the screen indicator will require the loading.
And read music consumes many energy.
Some cellulars can read music for more than 12 hours, only, and very less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest) are much more efficient.
As regards economic cellulars, they do not contain that they can duration for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from when, when some call, you're looking for a other loading bathroom, it's also the most costful devices.
But you don't have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst duration of at least 9 hours persistent functionality with a download.
A further problem occurs when music is downloaded in the phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices is available on the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be registered directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to make it without adapter for minicards that are not used in cellulars.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Please fill the device with the music via USB via the computer.
Most of the cellulars and readers only create a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the interpreters, the name of the album, the gene, or according to the user classification.
Some devices play only the tree structure, such as the Windows Tool Explorer, and some do both (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operational system).
Readers are easier to handle, cellulars can do more.
When you choose a special device, you are particularly interested in resistance to battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the use facility.
If the music needs you especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only shortly on the tram you need a cell that reads MP3.
That can now, clearly to any cellular.
You don't need to take too much care of what cell or reader forms.
The MP3 readers are all supporting, the overall majority of music that you are coming will be in this format.
Besides this format that belongs to the most common, the total majority of the devices support music in WMA format.
The AAC is less located (format used by the Apple company and its Ipods).
The best phones allow, for example, to buy online music.
Please visit, through mobile web, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service may already be a valid argument to buy a phone reader.
Unfortunately, the offering of the operators is bad and is usually limited only to the radio moment.
The prices are not very low.
However, it is generally suggested that this music sale mode (such as through GSM, Internet or without Fields) will domain the musical industry in the future.
Most people always carry the cell behind.
Whoever you want to listen to some fruit in the bag while the MP3 reader remains forgotten at home.
However, it depends also on this, if you are always taking back the coffee or at least the auricular without branches.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, you have.
Maybe the greatest advantage of the phone readers will, for many, be the price.
The more economic costs normally less than 30,000 corones.
For 3 and 40,000 corony you already understand a very dignified walkman.
However, you will usually be limited to the absence of an input for the common coffee.
The best cells and from the most equipped technical view and even with the load of 3.5 mm for common coffee, cost up to 15 billion coron.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, the easy maneuverability.
The simplest not necessarily more economic (see our choice) makes it really anyone to handle them.
The minimum of the functions, the sympathy of the handle a time with the common stereo or maybe the junction, is obviously.
There is no danger to shoot for the starting of a mobile network and resulting from a large switch for the transmission of data.
What device to take
The most economic cellulars (e.g. Vodaphone 527) have normally a slot for interchangeable card memory (of type M2, microSD etc.).
Even with regard to the purchase of the respective card, it is included in 2 000 corones.
But be careful
Base models only support cards with the maximum 2GB capacity.
Only those more costs do it with 8 GB memory.
If you already have a cellphone and you want to buy you also a MP3 reader, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spent more than 1 100 coron.
If you are part of the most required listeners, you preferably take the specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keyboards for MP3 and the comfort of the service is close to the same MP3 reader.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more road, the cellulars of the walkman line have the same use scale as MP3 readers separately sold.
The MP3 readers above shown you the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 coron, but with a larger memory capacity (before 16 GB) and the battery resistance (all 15 hours, in maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Maybe the market of mobile telephone in the Czech Republic is sufficiently mature, and our operators are almost offering all the services such as their partners in Western Europe.
However, it lacks something – an virtual operator that requires the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he's not missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most charming in Europe have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end of the accounts, it has also confirmed  yang has noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of the roaming tariffs, it may be a paradoxal situation - for some Czech mobile operators, the SMS will cost less from the outside than at home.
How can the prices in the Czech Republic remain so high towards Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really want to start the breakdown .
Maybe it sounds absurd, even that we have three mobile networks and highly covering over 100%.
Instead of mobile telofone operators, the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, also emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunication Council, Pavel Dvośák, who has recently expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its own network has no longer many opportunities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The internal market of virtual operators has brought a significant decrease of prices, which would then have to react traditional operators.
Similarly before the income of squads such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they resued in Britain similar voices as we were.
However, it has proved that the place for such operators is and that they can really have success.
In the end of the accounts for examples, we must not be far away.
In February this year we informed you about the arrival of the Virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In the only half year, this operator has been able to conquistate more than 1000,000 customers and to become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group in Czech Republic between the other U:fon.
The benefit of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a very more concrete group.
In order to effectively function, there are many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not take back, to say, relatively high expenditure for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are usually low costs, offers calls and SMS a little price, which is often balanced with the offer of the most limited services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a quite good move, even the smuggling on a group-scale for a while.
This operator points this way specifically on men.
"The true men choose the Mobilking operator that you like and whom you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if we can also say a similar concept in Poland.
It doubts the printing portal for Vodaphone Miroslav śepickī: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, which is based on most virtual operators.
In addition to the view of services, it is relatively saturated."
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, they say mobile network operators
But it seems almost sure that if there's an operator in the Czech Republic, it's not gonna be the Mobilking.
"You are talking about the expansion of this project of success, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic have no lot of expectations.
Mobilking's accension will be in the other countries of our area," said in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničkova, the printing of the Penta Financial Group.
Thus it is indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not decisively favourable to this thinking.
Nevertheless, they try to do everything because you do not believe any competitive potential.
From a little time it does not hide its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to make another step to become a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated about this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says the portfolio of the Pavel Kadl Group.
So maybe they'll get better time.
From non-official information it appears that the first virtual operator may have it within the end of the year.
For now, however, around his creation is an unreasonable wall of silence.
"We do not believe in the Czech market there is a space for the creation of a fully-valid virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now, no subject with a comprehensive and serious project has been referring to us," mentioned in its statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sscheō of the Telefonika O2 section.
The Czech market specifications also remember the other operators.
T-Mobil Martina Kemrova's printing portfolio adds in a rare agreement with the O2: Declaration "For now we have noted no vital and advantageous commercial project for both, which is possible to continue to build."
And add: "In the T-Mobile network it will find a virtual operator within the end of the year.
At this time we'd already have to have a concrete agreement on the table, as it would be possible to consider it at the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates his attention instead of reaching the requests of 3G license.
Add Miroslav śepickī: "We are open to negotiations of potential virtual operators and, especially, in the context of the share of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile phone operators can easily be understood, the income of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to the decrease of prices and thus to the reduction of profit.
Why then facilitate a such competitor?
Fastide around the creation U:fon shows that when operators have one thing they can stay on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure is pressed against tyTU during the creation period of U:fon towards the T-Mobile company.
This shows public access information from the websites of śTU.
But now now U:fon serves as a argument for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova noted: "The environment of mobile telephone market competition has been little powered overall with the entrance of the four-motive operator on the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obviously obvious that the entry of another competitor would bring on him and especially on its higher services."
However, the attitude of mobile phone operators is very surprising the full disinterest of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the UCU that, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - the difference between Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
This belongs only to the Economic Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
However, this against all the problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile telephone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the necessary infrastructure loan between mobile and virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded until the offer of potential purchasers probably was not enough interesting for traditional operators," said Christián Chalupa, the section for UOHS external relations, in response to our questionnaire.
A such statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprised.
Instead of the office that must defend the interest of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one uses its market position, is more than a delicate business.
In particular, when Christián Chalupa adds: "In the outside where virtual operators are commonly working, we can observe that their income in the market has contributed to the abbreviation of prices for mobile telephone services."
But obviously the pressure on the correct operation of the market environment and price reduction does not belong to the interests of UOHS.
Really shocking in all the situation is the almost emotive harmonity of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really only a match, it is alone.
Like the same price of the benzine for all benzine is otherwise the fruit of the convergence and the fighting competitive.
"The section has not found signs of anti-competitive behavior in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no corresponding responsibility for his market behavior.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile network for virtual operators may also miss the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many contrast points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the significant markets developed by tsunami, in which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the single market.
Of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always unacceptable to the network's experience agreement.
And the mobile operator has - in the end of the accounts logically – the monopolie of his network.
So for a certain part, it must be dominant for strength.
But even if we don't accept this argument, for UOHS, it should be a minimum alliance that three mobile operators do so strangely.
At the same time, the lamentations by the interested persons (including the called GTS Novera) show that during the negotiations with all operators meet very similar obstacles.
Download the responsibility to  zuTU in telecommunications is a sufficiently frequent truck with which UOHS is out of the whole fact.
This has already been realized in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of the rights of TurkishTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This is the fact that UOHS representatives have to know more than good, but maybe their interests are different.
You can do when no one looks
While we do not understand the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which are adjusted in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies which publish their price lists of mobile telephone services which, however, are only partly public.
This is usually a multi-level marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually reached only the providers.
The magic is in fact that the company against the operator is classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and otherwise).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czechic mobile operators prohibit such prevention.
"If the cases you have spoken, of which we would be interested, it could be a violation of the contract conditions, and could focus on the conclusion of cooperation with that company," said Martina Kemrova in question.
But it is so unproof that such activities did not reach the ears of the responsibilities of mobile phone operators.
In particular, in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be treated.
No operators are defending at the same time from such a attitude.
From the activities of these companies, it is an unfair profit and at the same time - from the difference of the real virtual operators - are not damaged in any way with its official marketing.
Miroslav śepickyi warns about the possibilities: "The law allows similar speculations, but only a recursive percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These should also accept that SIM cards in their phone are not registered on their behalf, therefore they cannot be fully available to it as normal mobile phone operators clients."
But this should be a minimum strange to the TurkishTU.
Moreover, there is another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close the eyes to such a attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficiently strong rights to smell such activities and if it does not want to be acknowledged by the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions are prohibited.
When we're not going to be more costs
As stated in the text again, the access of virtual operators on the mobile telephone market has brought a significant decrease in the prices for services.
At the same time in almost all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments that were used were almost identical - too small market, at too simple limit, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developing countries, in these cases, regulators have been involved not mobile phone operators but their customers.
Yes, with formal measures as well as with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator, and there have been others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are launching from each to the other as a boiling patch.
For our experience, we can't miss the sense that not clearness of the skills in these cases makes him more comfortable than me.
But we don't get the ring.
If the information of the retroscene is right, and the virtual operator will really appear soon from us, the Czech market of the mobile phone will turn back into motor.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain unpassable to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested persons.
And we may stop calling higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new twenty-first has four new versions.
Choose that best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Encyclopedia.
Sunday, the first Mirec Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech State recognition presented in a sole way the new registrations of the national "Kde domo mśj".
The new registration of the skin was made by the National Theater's Order under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions available – only with the men or women’s voice, core step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateиina Knśinkova and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the nation are Otakar Jeremiách and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNeed.cz website you can listen to all and four versions.
Bślohlavek considers the Czech National song one of the most beautiful skins.
Yes, he first said to the radio "Rozhlas" which has used to sing the variants alone, the songers with the youngest representative voices, which are expressive and popular.
"After the beginning I tried to care that both the king and the king, they have the clear word, that the text is well comprehensive, which are in harmony," said.
Then the national nation will celebrate the next year on 175 ^ anniversary.
The song "Kde domo mśj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the ball of Stavovskéh divadlo in the original Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, joined by František Škrupa music.
He has purchased the population and people have made it spontaneally.
The first stroph of the song after the foundation of the Czecholavacchia in 1918 then became the natural part of the nation.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the born of the Czech Republic.
Like the "new" enemy
The Mercoledì MHD of Praga will join you for the first time with an electronic tissue
Mercedes on 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company, such as the date in which the first passengers in the metro, tram and bus will go out in the place of the paper ticket, which will have an electronic tissue.
At this time you can search for about hundred thousands of people who have their Opencard teater .
The passengers can buy the letter from 30 and 90 days and year (which will vary from January 2009) and at the same time you can download their letter in Infopoint and the transport company offices and at the stop of the Metro Museum, Mśstek, Nádraí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letśany, Kobylisy, Rajská zharada, Kačerov and Luka.
The tags can already be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
From the service, more than four hundred customers have been performed before the afternoon.
Those who will start using Internet service can completely forget sports in the metro stops where they had to make long files for the paper tickets.
The cutting is buyed via Internet and opencard downloads it on one of the 12 municipal Library branches.
"In these places passengers have a sport with personal formats that will help those interested in purchase on the internet and also register the credit acquired on their paper." said Martin Opatrný's portal.
Besides in the libraries, you will be able to load electronic tags on Opencard in bankmat and self-service that are installed in the metro income.
How are these bankmats?
They are red, similar to the bike obliterators, and passengers have already noticed the stops of the Roztyly metro, Budōjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the whole city, but at the end of the year it should be obtained", concluded Opatrný.
The cut shall be checked instead of the author of the bankmat.
The bankmat service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Please enter the Opencard tissue and after payment of the cut, you'll be loaded above.
Electronic tights are not only in the capital, but also in its neighbors.
It is, in the urban trains and bus lines from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the central Bohemia are taking to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transport of Praga there are card controllers with which temporary and zone validity is checked", explained the control mode of Philip tickets from the Ropid organization, which puts the time of Prague's collective transport.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated in the castle of the audience.
It is therefore necessary to show the magnetic card to the auteur, but more need to support the Opencard at a specific point next to the castle.
So the author checks the validity of the loaded tags.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded tablets, there is nothing more easy than requesting the assistant to ask this type of information", added Drapal.
Travellers who take the urban bus and will not remember, when the validity of the switch is expired, they can again be loaded to bankmat self-service, where the tabs are loaded on the paper.
The information on the validity of their documents on the Device screen will be shown.
Germans of the Sudan wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the Sudans in 1945 asked to include Zhumava in the United States.
This results from the letter contained in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronate of the unified States.
With this desire, according to what it is said, some of the Sweden German groups have been held in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This results, moreover, from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans from Krumlov ask the President of the United States to not again allow the refund of the "The district of Šumava" – employed by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco Agreement – the Czechoslovacchia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units come to the German Territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes in the letter signed with the words "The people who have the destination of Zhumawa with all the hearts."
Because I say, the anxiety to Czechoslovakia – by knowing the Czech National Character – gives the Germans only hope of brutality, lack of views, incomprehension, oppression and slaveism, the authors of the letter call the American President to take the protect on Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a fourth million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a stranger state to us, which oppresses and sraads ethnic minorities and has not contributed to nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Alliances," writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the presumed fear of the seven of sale by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Zhumava, it would be able to organize a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may appear slightly with our knowledge of the history of the after-government war, according to some witnesses, it describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudans in a proper manner.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least intuite that they would be treated from their movement from the Republic, only few of them accepted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the people of the Sudan.
Others believed that they would only be stayed in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in śeské Budæjovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budhjovice in the Baltic Sea's maritime power.
When the end of the war was captured by the British and put in the prison field in Holštøn, the decades of other Czech Germans were going to find him when he taught the cecho.
"They believed that once they returned home the ceke would make him fun," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia pim of war, according to him, reported that the Decrees of Beneš would be moved by the Republic on the basis of the decrees.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the users
The most costful action in the Czech history addressed to road security.
This could also be defined by the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport is intended to make Mercoledì away.
The office of the Minister Alleš śebíček is expected that the drivers are delayed by a dangerous behavior to the flight.
The campaign from 150 million will appear in TV, radio, film, internet, but also on volantini.
It should slowly be used by the fast and under the effect of the alcohol to the flight.
And remember him to put the skin before you go.
He wants to touch the consciousness in particular young, motocyclists, bids and not for the last professional leaders.
What's going on in the spot?
Most of the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also witnesses the slogan "sanguinoso" of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "not think" is written on the pig.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "pay."
This must symbolize that a person may in a moment of distraction pay for his own life.
The spots will "shoot" spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has inspired the same campaigns in anglesome countries, which are commonly able to see images with drastic scenes of the victims of incidents.
You promise that you can decrease the number of incidents and die on the Czech streets.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carta and stone to drivers
"The cart and bastone system work with the users.
The cart for them is, for example, when they pass with red and so save time.
Bastone is the danger of the curse or incident.
You should remember the risk to drivers, "it says the psychologue of the Ministry of Transport, Martin Kośán of the Hospital Na Homolce.
And therefore they want us information campaigns in the print and especially negative advertising, believe the psychological.
He believes the smells that warn the danger users are already less effective.
"If you have been installed the fixed panel that warns the danger, you will probably soon be confronted with the environment and the drivers will not give you any attention to him," warns Kośán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories instead of peace
The first of the Israeli provincial government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the refund of almost all the territories employed in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, Jerusalem east and the heights of Golan, instead of the peace between Palestinian and Syrians.
Thus he said in the dialogue that published Monday, the daily Jediot Ahronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not only all," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians should leave the same percentage (of the Israeli regions), because without this, there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible refund will also include Jerusalem East .
"Whoever wants security to Jerusalem, and especially don't want to make the ruspe or spyanatrics the passing, as it has been successful to one of my best friends, he will be going to leave a part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in the arriving to the two attacks of Luglio in the city, during which some have been killed and twenty people blessed.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mountain of the temple, the sacred and historical places", which are inside the Old City. .
"The one who wants to maintain the sovereignty of Israel on the whole city shall be integrated by 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he also stressed.
Retreat from the height of Golan
Olmert also spoke for the retirement of Israel from Golan’s heights, that is, according to him, the uncertainty condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require a certain effort by Damasco.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the retreat from Golan," warned.
"The Syrians know well what they'll have to leave to get Golan's heights.
They will have to reject the current report with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with the Hezbollah (Scient movement); they will have to reject the permanent support, which offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Scienti) movement of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the sacred war) in Iraq," said the first.
Thursday after the incident: Is it illegal stewards in bus?
The law does not recognise them, it is not possible to walk on the bus that takes long distances
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Papava del pullman of the University Agency, the question is that stewards and passengers could move to the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the activity of steward is in conflict with the road traffic law," says the portal of the Minister of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident of last week with which life has lost a hostess of 22 years has been caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
The girl was sit at that moment close to the autist at the least safe place of the pullman, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or slowly shoot in the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or less than places on foot in accordance with the carriage book.
If it's not authorized, passengers must be sit down.
Student Agency's bus have not been placed on foot, you confirmed it to the updated site.cz director of the Radim Jančura.
"We have evaluated this with the Minister and at the beginning did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have the place assigned", he expressed his view.
The law does not recognise the steward.
"No clear legal interpretation of the role of steward – no law is concerned with regulating this role."
However, there is no regulation for the transporter to carry out services.
The road movement law only recognises the term accompanied by the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the portal Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Trade Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes, however, that the currency law is sufficient to this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approval places.
All this," says.
Categorize buses in urbans where there are places on foot and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with footsteps with higher and longer speed, treated without the footsteps with the maximum permitted speed and the seats of security cities.
Like in airline, it says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hośín does not find the substantial problem in the bus movement of stewards.
"The situation can be compared to air service during a quiet course.
It is not certain there when a turbolence arrives and the flight assistant can shoot the head."
"If the bus makes a frenate brush obviously valuable physical laws.
Like in the urban pullman or on the tram.
This carrier must solve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," said and intends also that the problem is not resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers steward services..
This uses about two hundred.
The Director even after the incident is thinking of their dangerous instruction.
"After I'm feeling to have to consider the profession of steward as a dangerous job, I'll abolish it.
Passerers can receive coffee and newspapers while they get out.
They would also reduce the expenditure," says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who is a line fraction of respect for the Student Agency, has motivated the lack of stéwards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we've already opposed.
Before or then, he will end with a dead incident," said less than one year fa Tøden.cz.
It’s happening a tragedy of it.
In the incident of the line for Napoli, a young hostess in the Plsès region was deceived, which had been working for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck is probably out of the emergency corse without using the arrow and locked the road to the pullman.
The driver of the pullman tried to avoid it with a brush manner, but he burned it with the previous right side.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places were employed in the rest of the stewart.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in long-trade pullmans, they are uncertain."
This is in mind of claiming the automobilist of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's judgment to pay the damages to the girl's family, but is expected to be financially rewarded by the guilt.
Revision of the law?
Not viewed
The revisation of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport for more than one year, could lead to the movement of stewarts at bus board.
"They have not achieved any concrete results.
They do not consider both pullmans, they take more than the pointing system, maximum speed on the auto and use of the cell during the guidance," says the experts Hośin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewarts as a great threat to the safety of passengers", concludes the portfolio Havelka, that bus safety control is the competence of the police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point on Francoforte
They do not miss the talks in the letter of the WestLB Director addressed to the home collaborators.
In the Monday letter that could be "the capital market center of the Financial Case Case Group" through the meeting of the Bank Institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Francoforte.
West LB would start a "competent block" with sustainable benefits in such a company.
In addition, all of this unit could be a decisive shock for further links in the field of the countries' banks.
Thus it is read when a administration advisory in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
Because WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the European Commission but also through the National Financial Monitoring Service, noting time ago to the regional government of Northern Rwanda - Vestfalia that the time leads to the search for a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, that the same customers of the Casse di Resparmio are already known because of their investment funds, and the WestLB certainly speaks about a little nice, even by Francoforte.
He reported at the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas in the presentation of the first half of the year that a fusion of the house on the way Magonza with a national bank like Helaba or West LB has no sense.
However, the Governing Board of Deka, which is brought by the regional banks and the consortion of the cash, delegated the Administration Board to conduct meetings with West LB on common contracts.
It could be the market negotiations or parts of them.
However, the discussions, as they say, have just started.
Dela Deka-Bank, with its 3000 collaborators, is one of those who contain more businesses in Francoforte, it is not the first time that it is to consolidate the resparation sector.
In 2003, a short period seemed that Deka-Bank could be found with the Regional Bank of Renania-Palatinato and Helaba.
From this association with three, there is nothing to do.
As projects were published, the Asian regional bank was contrary to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have proved to be incapable of reaching an agreement.
The regional bank of Renania-Palatinato went to the regional bank of the Baden-Württemberg in Stoccarda.
However, they have always thought about a Deka-Bank fusion with regional banks.
But at the end, the President of the Helaba's Directorate Council, Ohther Merl, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
This seems to be aware of the knowledge, which is necessary to draw close to the various cases of the public sector.
As the Bavariase Parliament has been elected, first, a Baden-Württemberg Country meeting could be held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba isn't all a good news.
If you increase the pressure for other fusions, your hands will miss partners.
In the south now there would be the Juner partner, although now the financial crisis has overcome very better houses in Monaco and Stoccarda.
The association of Asia-Turingia resparance boxes participating with the 85% of Helaba has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
It would be only NorthLB.
These geo-strategic reasons are only one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question how the various affaric models of the single houses are compared.
In June, Merl noted that the decision-making question, with which the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be given a response by the association of German resparation casses.
At the end, the West LB division could also be out, which is not naturally desired.
Thus the letter of the Board of Administration expresses the will of aspiring in every case to a "general resolution".
You will see how the reunification of the single parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
IL second weekend of the bird party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time when Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present to the party as a friend, and so he says it's different.
Besides 5l. of the Kaiser Mark is on foot a barbecue and shows to about 200 travelers who are the deep tons that can produce from the gorge.
Elena's first to Luke a cup and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking near the Port Newa station, they start this night at 23.45 4 flights with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra, arrived at 6,30 p.m.
Three flights are mainly booked to Italians, only in Brazilians.
In one angle of the parking, the South Americans are sing with the band in their hands, having already been celebrated during the night.
It is so humble, says Marco, that it is not for Italians.
Marco that brings a long capt with false shoes and a couple of eyes with armed widths belong to the bus.
For five years, they go to the Octoberfest, this year are 3 tours.
The night date, day to the party, returning at 22:30.
Tonight, he would only believe unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The cost of 45 euros includes the journey, the welcome of the brindisi with the Kaiser bird, made according to the bavarian reality standards, the illness and the German guide – Marco has visited a German course in Francoforte.
And so night the bus go back to the Brenner.
There's no bird yet.
The silence falls in the bus, the travellers sleep.
Better so, they will still need their forces.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian targa on the A9 road before Monaco make a short break.
When, as it is expected, the Marco group arrives at 6,30 to the parking near the Theresienwiese, there are already some 50 bus from all Europe.
Elena, Lusa and the others are grouping, Marco explains the attack programme last time.
First: Put the yellow caplin.
On the left, "Oktoberfest" is written next to the Internet address of the Marco Travel Agency: "Conoscersivialing.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the cemetery of the bird means fly!", says Marco first morning.
"Core!" Run and take the places behind the tent.
"It's not before, but we're locked, and not all the yellow legs sit on the same pants, divided into the acute space!"
The coast is 8.25 euro, Marco url.
And don't forget to give a shirt.
"Demonstrate security service, that we have good conduct!
When you leave the place, they're gone!"
Third: "State at 22.30 points we'll meet again here! Comprehended?"
He's part of the party.
On the road a attack as you follow the yellow woods to the trees, the road cards and even an advertising card of a large bavarous party.
You want to be ready to cut the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as "the final week of the Italians".
There is no need to be a 50-mile, which goes to cross the Alpi and enter the tendings, that 10% of the visitors are deeply derived from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened by seven officials of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first place with 200 medical cures in front of the English (circa 60 medicines) and Australians (circa 80).
Predominantly loved by Italians is the tendon of the Hofbruuhaus.
1. Unsomn nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stabil, confirmed the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week..
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and also understood that the German banking sector is not covered by critical developments.
Because the crisis has started the weekend.
The real estate funder Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtained from a German bank consortium a milliardary credit, so that you can protect from market turbolences.
A special person in the situation said to Reuters Monday, support credits would be reached up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interests for the requesting party.
The money comes both from private and public banks.
The loss of the Depfa affiliated are in the back.
The State financing under a newspaper article has been refinanciated in a short term – which is not possible because of the market challenge.
In the first half of 2008, bank reserves were reduced from 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and the capital share also decreased from 1,6 to 1,45%.
The current income and the net revenues from financial affairs were decreased by 0 compared to the last year, the benefits for increased and certain shares in the liquidation of appropriations in funds were lowered by more than 70% of EUR 5 ml.
Only by higher income from the refund of subordinated compensation costs that are due to the restructuring of the ex-Depfa group as well as from the reimbursement of interests according to the single text of tax laws and the management of business consumptions, the negative benefit has been sufficiently moderate with approximately 16%.
The former public financer after being privatized in 1990 was lost in the speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were expelled in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic State financing was too low, Depfa has undertaken more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects of private and state investors (PPP) and has been internationally diversified.
The Hypo Real Estate now must amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a basic material effect on the profit and loss of the group.
The fact is that the divisions have been cancelled.
Yes, in 2007, 2/3 were reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after the Depfa absorption is an important financing of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer credit deposits.
As a result of the american investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the grant of credits between banks in the main part has been cut, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate is annually required for a part of the Depfa credit portal – about 50 mld. – short-term refinancing means.
According to the advertisement of the Real State, the financial requirements of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the impact of the monetary markets for most non-operators.
From other sources it feels that refinance is assured by money until the end of 2009.
The President of HRE Georg Funke's Directorate Committee, on the other hand, said that the HRE Group will not need the currency markets shortly.
The Federal Bank and the National Financial Monitoring Unit (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group’s commerciality is still insured.
This is hopeful for shareholders and bank creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the impassency of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the financing is not completely used.
But the opposite is not to exclude.
After Sunday night the bank was learned about it was to fail, the current salvation has not been able to calm the souls.
The share rate of EUR 75% over 3,30.
They regulate the courses of each other.
While the previous level debts are almost inadmissible, the rates of the poster credits fall.
In particular, the members of the Associated Württemberg-Hypo include the deficiencies with expiry over 2009.
Before the residents of the HRE seemed to be an alternative investment, their valuance should now be considered to be depending on the stability of the international financial system.
Even if the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, you can be counted on an ammunition of annualities within the term.
Or in function, what no one is shocking to expect – that the financial crisis will exceed within the next 15 months.
But with regard to information recovered because of partial statistics, almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will, in particular, create long-term investors a few nights in the decision if they divide themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the report of losses for future compensatory tax payments on maturity.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop was 16 years old, the first school day should be presented to Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to ride: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas-n new exchange log in Japan.
The first school day in Japan
I was so excited.
I was also able to go to school.
I am at the borders of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes of train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her alone, and I wasn't lost.
The beginning of the first lesson hour seems not to be fixed as we are at the Bass Sasone.
The schools arrive soon from 8 in later, until 8.40 begins a short colloquie with professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, he touched me to present me.
I am not the type that speaks desirants in front of people, instead of a class of 40 schools.
Since I had not yet the school uniform, I put a old round of the hosting mother, together with a shop, blue calcets and shoe shoes.
Thus I was put before the cattedra and I tried to speak well: "Syonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebration between one week my birthday.
At that time I was very pleased to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have been able to shut up and sign, and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
I've already known her from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessic of Japanese girls to survive and meaning "sweet, sweet".
Then I run fast to my place.
The girl close to me, she was a honour to sit next to an interchange student.
The rest of the lesson time was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the real sense of the word.
Everything talked disorderly and ridicule, and they settled me with questions – then it's really difficult to understand the English of Japanese.
In the pause, everyone opened their blessings.
My hosting mother also made me the mom for Lunch - is different from the German panins.
I had rised with species, salsiccin, ceriol and algebra, fruit and a species of involving with meat and tofu..
I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
The things look strange and have a completely new shooting.
In fact, it's really good.
Maybe except the shoes cut down, brrr!
The Blessed is not only dinner at Japanese schools.
There is a time when a girl regrets a Bento done from if, prepared enough artistically, with hope to make the boy's knowledge during the recreation.
I read it in my manga smokes.
I'm really interesting if I can find it.
"Why really Japan?" They asked me my friends when I told, I would like to go to Japan for a year to school.
I always said:
"Why I'm funny."
Finally, I'm reading the Mangas for years.
And to better understand the smokes and cultures that contain, before or then I started learning a little Japanese language.
I was completely convinced to come to us once.
I also love traditions, uses and costumes.
I have a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and last trends - from the opposite part: serious, disciplinary and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never heard lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a rat fly when they feel the danger.
The scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be realized if, when we act in the same way, we have the same feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for a few years are published newspapers.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers selected to the question: "What do you think it's true, without trying to try it?"
I think that animals have feelings or other conscious states, without me or somebody else have been able to try it, since we can't even prove that others have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. When we look at other species and ask questions about the feeling or in general of conscience, we enter into a impratory territory, because the reference base is not coherent.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that the other animals do.
People act in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make us difficult to transmit our feelings to the animals.
One part, the front frontal cortex is often linked with human consciousness, the associated circuits (as for its direct comparison to the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In the man this long area is much more developed than in the first and seems that among the other creatures it is totally missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness depends on the frontal court, including knowledge, whom we are, and the ability to plan and decide, so the foundation on the presuppose that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic speciality should be presented in a man's way: as a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as has been done, will certainly differ much from the circumstances of our conscience.
This is why it is difficult to find out how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through his experience because of the special hardware, their research will lead to great problems.
The majority of the interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the conscience to which science would be more easy to access.
We can analyze animal conscience processes without their contents, and this happens in studies on the short memory of the primates, especially in the example of the vision.
So for this principle, Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, they are before the neural correlations of conscience as well as the cause mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also shows the value of the prefrontal court for the implementation of the vision.
So what does it mean for feelings?
I put them into the fact that a emotional system like fear is active in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
So what we indicate as "terror" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, like body reactions) is working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely connected to the regions of the court, which characterize the primates and in particular human being.
With the speaking nature, it creates subtle sfunctions of the hearing, because we with the help of words and grammatics we can distinguish and categorize the situations, to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings result from most primitive activities in the regions of the body of the feelings of the cutting and the cephal paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, which, however, has focused more on the paleocefale.
Since this network during human evolution has not been much changed, this could be absolutely part of the extensive feelings of the species.
At the purely theoretical level, I can't contradict it, but I think it is unproofable.
Pankseep adds arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears like fear, you probably have so warned with the sense in both cases: but how can you see, if rats and human beings prove the same thing when they act in a similar manner?
A shock in the case of danger flee as if he felt fear?
For my eyes, simple behavior likeness can not show any vital likeness yet.
And that is, the neural compartment continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, the skins even a brain.
But is the paleoencefale responsible for feelings?
And when could you even prove it for human beings: how would you like to prove on the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, perhaps adjusts insects (who knows it?), feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (for human conscience is based on specific circles and languages), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are progress at neural levels here, as it comes to the same procedure on rats and men.
As I do not search for language and consciousness in rats, so I do not do it about their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered mype, but I prefer to step forward, rather than shoot continuously against a wall.
I'm a practical emotive for the appunt.
The President of the EUFA Platini: sent for Poland and Ukraine
The first Vice-Premier Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision to Bordeaux as a demonstration of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," said Watjunik
"But this is not an amnisty for our country.
The work is just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both home master countries are zoppicating in the march table for the construction or reconstruction of stories, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be advised to Europe will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose more time.
Now we must work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association Grigori Surkis.
"EUFA will have us constantly"
A more radical step has been done in Poland.
After many scanners, the direction of the Poland Association PZPN was suspended by the National Olimpiade Committee and replaced by the independent Administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was meeting on request by the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would follow "the serious danger that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules", said Drzewiecki to the Polish Information Agency.
"In a letter we have assured the President of the EUFA Michel Platini that the preparation to the EM 2012 will not be suffered."
Many exhibitors of the first division only in the past stage have been sentenced for handling, and finally the League's beginning had to be sent back to the last time.
Dennis Quaid angry
She wanted to promote a new movie, in an interview, he talked about the privacy, and now has greatly with the former: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid.
He's ridiculous and ridiculous.
The war of the Roses shocked for the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood are now discussing one with another a bad strict - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week was expressed on the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been on my long faith, and this was very painful."
You would have come to know her only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "spogliar of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – it is the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adult husband was clearly distracted: it would be "audited", said the fifty-third to "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the first time repeated and re-elabored the story of our report".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack, the seventeenth son who had together, again "remembered publicly the pain and sovereignty, that a separation means for each child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and will soon become a gentle father.
And therefore his judges are closed with the arrow: "My life in every case goes forward.
I'm glad to have a wonderful family to whom everything works for the best."
Call prices for airlines and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and stocks in Europe were more economic than the previous year.
In Germany, the flights would be up to 50% more economic
Flights and nights in hotels have become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and traveller American Express.
The company analyzed its data of the booking of the first half of 2008, and after an increase in prices in the first quarter, he observed a clear calamity in the second quarter.
After the hotel prices have been increased for years, the prices in many places are already calmed.
From January to March the prices in 41 of the 48 European cities that have still been examined in average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June the prices were over 3,6% lower than the previous year.
The most apparent trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than one year ago.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, which would lead to a "called desire to travel from American tourists"
Financial centres such as Francoforte and London would be touched by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way from the industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norway city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% deserve record in Europe
In terms of flight prices, the trends in the first quarter are still signed above:
As a result of the cherosene rash of the Economy Class passengers had to pay average 7,1% than 2007, long-term fuel flights would be reached until 29.2% more carriage
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets have been calculated in a mean of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in business price changes have been larger.
In Germany The prices are still stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices were decreased by 11.9 %, in the second quarter, 23.6 %.
As regards the German internal flights according to the study, prices have been divided.
The reason for the price growth would, on the one hand, be the low economic growth, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the aircraft market has been cut off.
On the other hand, it would be through the open heaven agreement that liberalizes the air traffic between the uses and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
The mark of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-receiving trafficking at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared fall – only in Europe was treated by 24 airlines.
HSV fights Gladbach for 1 to 0

The dark matter influences the flight of space sounds
For years, a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space sounds during the so-called Swing-by hand.
The experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relationship may not be all exact.
Space Sonda Ulysses fly through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel tuberculosis that frozen rapidly now constitutes death for congelation.
Among the scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates disappearance – the anonymity of the/o Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manner of space sounds, with which they obtain extra slancio/spita/oscillation in the gravity field of a heavenly body, for example, Earth.
So the sons can save much fuel.
The Euro-American research sond Cassini-Huygens has used this physical experiment as well as the Ulysses sun.
What the students have been surprising for years: the races do not act all as we would expect according to the gravity law.
On the other hand, there are irregularities in the speed.
Sounds become immediately faster or slower.
Until the physicians could not explain this effect.
Annomy of the Swing-by's year.
Some experts are afraid that there may be the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeness, which describes the attraction force of the material with a curvature of space, may not be all exact.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton strongly believes as before Einstein did not wrong, and try to explain the anonymity of the Swing-by through the so dark matter that the astronomes have advertised in the cosmo.
"Annomy answer may be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," writes.
From the existence of the dark material, space students are known only for about 10 years.
From her obviously is a attraction force, whose effect on other heavenly bodys is seen.
Instead of all invisible, it is not shipping or reflecting any electrical radiation of sort, especially appended any visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark material is at least a good fifth of the whole cosm mass.
Tourists raised in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their sequestrators, tourists raised in Egypt would be newly free, as he confirmed the Italian minister.
The drivers from Sudan requested a number of millions of euros to rescue.
In a shooting prior to release 6 sequestrators were killed.
In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans were raised.
The ransom treaties have already been undertaken.
The Germans are always in the sight of the sequestrators.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists raised in Sahara are certainly free.
This reported consequently the Egyptian state television, the Arab Embassy Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the delivery after the Italian television disaster Sky TG 24: "Their civilians and other obstacles have been released
We're looking at their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian councils would be in good health and security, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a sending in the wilderness have already been traveled to the Cairo.
They still remain a little clear the retroscene of a shooting that happened before the release of the obstacles: so the rapiers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been prepared for the conclusion of the slaughter, before the Sudan army killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," he said the officer.
It would be "the only traction to take the obstacles to deliver", when soon the "this surprise has arrived."
The Sudan troops in the border zone between the Sudan, the Ciad and the Egyptians killed by firearm 6 of the rapiders and captured two of them.
The sequestrators had provided from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money would have been granted by the German wife of one of the shops.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported about a German intermediary, the release of obstacles would be delayed because the raders feared their security.
According to the report, the sequestrators wanted to put women free in ostation after the cash payment.
The men would have been guarded so that the raders wouldn't have had a safe way of escape.
The German Ambassaded Cairo rejected a position in respect of the report .
The patriarch's abuses "trained to suicide"
Years of abuse by the patriarch has brought a woman to kill himself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, in Stithians, Cornovians, was in prison for six years after being adopted eight cases of sexual aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he had regularly angry his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she had between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a note of condemnation: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Mrs Randle was killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise blessed her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while the mother was out of work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the Ottanta years, and he returned to live in Cornovia.
His daughter's head went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent long as volunteer to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuses caused by her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife said to the court that the friends of Mrs Randle, who was a supervising and ciclist, were "emotionally dead", and he had "motively mocked with life".
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think he's killed suffering with a plastic store.
Mr. Randle comforted her daughter's patriarch, who wrote a condemnation letter that ended: "I lied and blessed her."
"I haven't been sexually angry.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "He is a very strange feticist, and for his victim must have been terrible, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This splendid saga ends with the victim that gets out of life.
More harder is the fact that if it wouldn't have done it, it would be difficult that the facts were completed before the court."
I realize the effects that the father and mother of Stephanie have had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that you were a promised and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office of Cabinet Office, which left top secret documents on a train in June, must be accused of the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred by the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the less delicate of the accused under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal attempt.
BBC Frank Gardner’s defence corresponding said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"It would have thought that this would be treated internally to the Mode and the Bureau," said .
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is accused of being accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clauses relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the official should be accused of the metropolitan police because of the very sensitive nature of his work.
Documents lost contained Al-Qaeda assessments and the ability to Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the Monday Decision and was taken away from his home and brought into a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
The English construction companies could face an account of more than 800,000 £ after the saving of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government gave 14 billion sterlines to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money of the suppliers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Society Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion sterlines will be repaid if the mutual partners of Bradford & Bingley will be rescued.
But the interest that will be matured in fractures will pay each year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will be mature will be depending on 700 financial companies accepting deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's unfortunately that those institutions that have been conducted in a careful way... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits that he had, and that the company among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Tesor estimates that the interest in the loan will increase to 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that companies will find 81 million sterlines to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Construction Society Association, said to the BBC that he believed it is injust.
"It is unreasonable that those institutions that have been conducted in a careful way in the home market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very less careful."
According to BSA, no company has failed since the documentation started in 1945.
"We have to examine all aspects in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account", added Mr Cole.
The interest required in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year at the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of the whole year will be required and this may be almost two times higher.
Since the construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members are finished to pay the account through higher prices or lower interest rates on accounts.
Milk salt to 5 penny to litro
People in Jersey face the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.

Detail salers must decide whether they want to download price increases on their customers.

Denied the warranty to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh Court rejected a request for warranty by President Sheikh Hasina, which means that you might be arrested when it returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the Court refused to grant you a warrant for 50 million taxes (729.700 dollars) to a business man when he was a member of the Parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption accused us against her.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on warning at the beginning of the month.
The return to the Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next weeks, but his party, Awami League, requested that the temporary government of the country supported by militarys the day before the total freedom.
The correspondants say that while you were going outside for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your delivery, if you can stay free when returning to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has refused the request for warranty for Sheikh Hasina by pointing out that you can't have the warrant viewed that it's already outside on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present you a call against the Holy Court's order."
His lawyers explain that they need the assurance to return from the country to the outside to prepare the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina's return after October 17, he said a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was detented last year after the military force engaged in the military force, but he was released in June to go to the outside to receive medical care.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the accused of them.
fear for the Afghan anti-political campaigns
About 200,000 children in Afghanistan lack the recent immunization campaign because of violence connected to the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has forwarded a 6-year vaccination programme in the province.
But it is said that you can't reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations portal said that this happens, despite the promises of Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of people of the staff who carried in vaccination.
BSkyB lost legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal struggle with the Commission's decision of Competition to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV TV station.
BSkyB was said by the competitive court to break its actions in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB's participation prevented competition and allowed a ITV-infringement.
BSkyB purchased the participation in 2006 in an agreement which actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB in ITV is doubtful about ITV's independence, so that the Commission was launching an investigation.
The Head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that preventing it to reduce its ITV stage was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedie - especially as BSkyB had said it would overcome its vote rights.
New investigation on the case of the Procureur of the United States
The American Prosecutor has appointed a Public Minister for the examination of the license of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurs when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticizes the actions of the administrative officials.
The report was critical towards the White House, the legislators and the former lawyer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was cut off from the fear that the applicants would have been removed for political reasons.
The Special Minister Nora Damehy will now invest whether the investigators interviewed have lied to the investigators in the attempt to prevent justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behaviors have not been completely investigated or approuved", said the Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The allocation of a special public minister with the power to strike witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine American lawyers were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers had been denied for deficiencies.
But later it was shown that licensed lawyers had not been evaluated more than many other colleagues, bringing many observers to conclude that the license was motivated by the policy.
Some of the applicants were involved in the judiciary action against the representatives of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the accusation of fraud to the damage of democratic electors.
American lawyers investigate and bring forward to courts on account of the government.
They may be licensed at any time, but they cannot be licensed for political reasons.
The next Head of the Justice Department, the Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for licensing, and finally resigned his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice have been departured.
(The report of the general Inspector was very critical in terms of the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that it was a primary responsibility in the licenses that had been subject to his leadership and was extremely highlighted during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's previous senior assistant, were criticized because they did not cooperate with the investigations.
The epic of the Loaf Meat will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored to Q Awards for his innocent epic Bat Out Of Of Hell.
The songant, who will remove his special gold premium at the ceremony next week in London, said to be "good" to win the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the album of the 1977 Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will conduct the appointments for the premises of this year, which is on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that transcenden things as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is without doubt one of those."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, required a strong voice provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with a structural section that was nearly two minutes.
The song was performed as a single UK in 1979 and reached the fifth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in class and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart battius in 2003 after he shocked on the ball.
In 2007, the rings took the costs to cancel the concerts.
It was later that he had a quote on a vocabulary corde.
Dark streets of town, often forgotten and maybe soon in sale
New York City has thousands of adventures, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, other merchants of use.
But also many veterinary taxists and residents have been very difficult to give the position of Extra Place, for the way they have never heard it.
The small road is in East Village and go north of the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet width and 120 of length, like a powder wheel than an active way to traffic.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
Nevertheless, the road must have a mystery.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of recent light buildings built on the First Street.
You want to restore Extra Place and create a cleaner shopping for shopping and boats that should open in the new buildings.
Other astronauts include neighbors for a long time that say they were affected by the changing road simply because it was one of the last remainings of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has the road control, is not interested in holding it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the use of the field of the Common Commission of the Cities and Avalon Bay, some representatives of the Cities Agency and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the real estate company to buy the ways.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and he asked a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There's very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to have Extra Place," said.
"It may be the proposals to system it and to manage it, which might be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay has been announced a few months ago to restore the small road and to install seat places, including some to use a coffee where the real estate company hopes to allocate the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay buys the road has been public for the first time at meeting this month.
Michele de Mily, a portal of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to have it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this decree and transform it into a public agency," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Reservation Portal, said that it was really the desire of the city to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the Agency was to develop the property instead of managing it.
Comparing to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a historic light.
Some believed that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company that had Philip Minthorne came to divide between his many children and the stretch of land was not claimed.
The door on the back of CBGB, the rock rock monument closed in 2006, open on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The land was wonderful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was a cold of immondience, clothes and pieces of bottles, poster, sheets, cords."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "generation" of the East Village, opposed to sell Extra Place, adding that the part of public property, modestly, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a frame of town almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (which said, "The book of lamentations: A look at a little nostalgic to the city in the way of extinction"), published part of a discorse of the city’s history that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an extra angry of viuceness without out, drinks also day and delimited doors of shopping helmets and windows with chairs, with old weekly newspapers that swim through the baskets."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent night.
A rat slowly runed through the back of the road next to a door that drived inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing shop.
Their walls were graffiti and a empty blue bottle of 22 once ice near a group of abandoned daily freshes.
Some past men said they were rarely thinking about Extra Place but they suggest that they would need to be a little pleasant.
Mr Fields, on his part, said that some people also think that the attraction of the road in its current state is underestimated.
"The best years of my life," he said, "we were in black, shocked and disgusting places."
The bilateral debate: submission in English
In this point of educational look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California's studies and the senior Director of Educational Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-auteur of the book "Don't good as think: Why the media class needs to choose a school."
To take the Spanish electors really is a complicated business.
The educational projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the African and Latin students have significantly less likely to diplomate than the white students, "what is true.
To fight these shortcomings in the achievement of the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitory bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which highlights the teaching in different languages from English, does not take into account its interest in meeting learning differences.
Let's take, for example, Sexth Street Prep, a elementary school in the Eastern Lake of Los Angeles.
School students are for most Spanish and low income.
More than a third of students, many of whose recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students tested higher levels in 2008's review of the state of mathematics.
A very surprising 93% of the fourth students have made the expert level test on the art-di-linguage-ing.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from the favorite by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the repass and exercise, constantly evaluated the skills and a position of the type "no apologis".
In addition, and here, Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of the Sixth Street, the objective approach of the school for English students is "full support."
The use of English highlights the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposed the bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you were in the 12 months after you wouldn't have been able to identify what it was."
"Function," she observed "for us work."
Obama would take the model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (National Education Associations is a long-term supporter of bilingual education) and its continuing support for bilateral education prevents the response of Mr Obama.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently resolved the question when he said that people should stop her worried about the "single-English legislation".
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement lacunes, it should be carefully considered the educational models that work instead of disrespect them or banalising them.
The oil burns brushly and renews economic fear
The oil prices are slowly reduced because of the concerns that even the American Reserve Plan for Financial Markets may not be able to reverse the economy.
The future of the green has fallen from 7% to $99.80 at the bar at the New York market shop in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than 20 dollars at bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of the first materials have been defeated by the financial flow of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful uragans in the Golf of Mexico.
After reaching a small amount of $145.26 at the bar in June, prices were covered up to $90 at the bar at the beginning of this month, before coming again, on the background of a tremendous incertitude in the financial markets.
The anxiety has influenced the investors again Monday also after the Congressive leaders had said to have reached an agreement at the weekend about the saving plan, the greatest of the history.
The news was desired by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far away from the past.
In the last episode of progressive fusion, Citi Group will cover Wachovia Corporation bank operations, said the Sunday Government.
At the same time, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the Forced European Financial Conglomerate.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations of the weekend had brought to a saving agreement "It seems to have failed to revive the market's feelings.
While the worst economic situation is expected, the demand of primary materials, including oil, will calm.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and markets of change rates has become incertain", wrote the investors' analysts of the German Bank in a note.
"We believe that the first materials will not be able to escape the county.
From a perspective of the first materials, our most closest concern is until what point the American virus will escape globally and in particular in China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year while house oil consumption is due to the reintegration of economic growth, reduceing oil prices and gas prices of approximately 20 percent for 2009.
The exploitation in the second fourth signals a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more stages, Defense Shaun Elis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked out of the second Sunday's fourth, when the Jets have transformed a game without points in a remon.
"I saw something like this," said Elis.
The second fourth was started after the Jets and the Cardinals had equally the grid of the threatsful clouds that were over them with a slight game.
Then the Quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for a midday in which their growing symptoms made a great step forward.
Favor has found Coles for other two touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback is fallen and one with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I'm not out of my way," he said, "I'm not out of my way," from all the travels arrived in Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were taking games, the defence struggled cruelly the quarterback of the cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and lifted it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passenger and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a warner smoke.
The last turnover, the forced smoke by Bowens, might have been the most sensitive.
The Cardinals went in advantage on that owner of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely shooted a metro from 20 yards, for a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever marked in a room.
When it was asked to describe the patient, the Coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second fourth or third room?"
When it was said both - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third fourth - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I've enjoyed more than the second fourth than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a small time lace."
Burrselassie relied over his world's record
Haile Bergselassess of Ethiopia has again shown because many consider it the best maratoneta forever, broken their same world record at the Sunday Berlin marathon and become the first person to run a course of 26.2 miles below 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a pleasant victory on the course in 2:03:59, Burselasi sent in frantumes for 27 seconds his previous point of 2:03:26, past year in Berlin.
At 35 years, Burserlassie puts the 26th world's record of a so unbalanced carriage that has produced a worldly sample or a world record at every distance from the Metro to the Maratone.
Last month, Burserlassie slaughtered the Olympic Maratone of Pechino, fearing - maybe too alarming - that air pollution would deteriorate its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In conditions almost perfect - solely and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival - Bursellas has winned Sunday with a slow average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per million.
Soon as a mid-based founders such as Bergerlasie and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to a long distance, the record of the maratona has fallen over more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brasil arrived to Berlin in 1998.
After the Sunday's winning, Burserlassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had powders and missed a week of allies.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not angry.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporter.
"It was perfect.
I recalled a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end, everything went well."
It was a little criticized - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - to have excessively orchestrated his garages, generally avoiding many of the best marathonite stars in the world, counting on appliances as if it was a suburb, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these critics rarely reduce the size of the competences of Bursellas as maratoneta.
With the step cast by four horns Sunday, Burserlassie reached the half-way road point in 1:02:04.
Two elite flights, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, were held in competition in Burselassi after the applicationists were svanished.
A little more than three miles from the arrival, Burserlassie made a final census to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, enhancing its best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi has arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the Women's Guard, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan, who is now German citizen, has completed a significant year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time than ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world's record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was an surprised winner of the Maratona of London in 2:24:14.
The Pechino games have been lost with what is described as a bad incident, but it is careful to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third moon that has run.
You've been able to make the calculations well, letting a quarter of Ethiopia and Kenyan corridors participate with a great distance, retaining them after about 18 miles and half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia has arrived in the second century, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya has finished the third in 2:25:01.
In a cityside, pride and processes of a black life
I hide in the extensive theme park on Orlando's subbows, just a few miles from smiling, laughing, and humbling, the quiet city where the honour and complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city entered into the country and the birth house of Zora Neale Hurston, is not so simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three crowd camps, 300 brown skins, 300 good skins, swimming, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pellegraining.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect in Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Even in many ways, the city that has described - and that it stops tourists including it in the Tourist Guide of Florida produced by the Federal Depression Writers' Project - remains a place in part.
It is so independent, dignity and private as it was in the Trent years, when Hurston wrote that rural nears in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, "who knowing that little of us, you don't know what it's lost."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential name, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for a opening talk on the race, many who remain different from the sight of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, was a resident from the whole life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"I must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of trionfo and difficulty.
It is an historical model of black power that is almost 2.400 community where poverty rate is two times the national average.
It is a letterary centre, but also an example of the shadow of the dark of the rural culture of the Southern blacks - sometimes designed, sometimes praised - born by the American slave.
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern of the imagination of Eatonville really started with Zora, who all here call Hurston.
She presented the world to her birth city through sincere books, rich dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Guide of Florida transformed the city, just outside the Root 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida in a scenario of black and human drama
Bad as a bag in life as well as in literature, Hurston brought readers in the trade with the first school of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then moved to more private areas.
"Fuori from the left to the road," wrote, "it's the modern public school, marron with the white refinations, with its well-served and cortile gardens, where Howard Miller was always sweet, thinking that he could just read and write."
You also mentioned the new husband of the Vedova Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "seats all the types and anything that suits to the passenger rooms."
Thus, just a few hundred words, Hurston has connected Eatonville to self-government but also with analfabetism, second noise and sex.
Of course this was not Fodor.
In fact, it wasn't a retreat that everyone appreciated.
"It was telling it how it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortally cites men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
Add: "There's some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living spectacle that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, is remembered that when Hurston was broken in the city, he usually arrived without warning in a triangle Chevrolt, smoking and smoking pantalons in a city that even today benefited from the dignified beauty.
Many people were shocked, says Mr. Franklin, while others were disappointed.
"The people were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, adding, dondondo on his floor on the back of the Sabelian lake, where Hurston was very likely to be baptized, "laught never remained long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
Against the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was once a letter star, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, he was sepulated in a gate without tasting in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremony, and no great conference.
"I don't believe that they understand their contribution to the world or their leave to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 80s.
Orange County officers wanted to put a five-course road through the city to restore Kennedy Boulevard, the main road to two corsies.
Orlando's expansion has already broken The Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal comes when Eatonville was still retaining from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had finished the relative idly isolation of the community
In the Fifth Year, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the gate of the community.
"In that period, a group of white kids came and cast out arances and things to the people who sit on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed once.
They got a shop from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made an application to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defineing its decision in Brown against the school office "un insulted instead of honor for my race".
The residents now say that the degree of schools, although they have been positive under some aspects, disrupts the cohesion of Eatonville and suddenly puts the confidence of their young people.
"The black kids were used to be broken - I remember this - abbreviate your teacher on the morning, cut your teacher on the night", said Mr. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This duration, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You don't cut your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights, in any way, helped and create space for many other Neale Hurstons - black writer, actor and artist who overcome the damages, as he did, with safety of himself and lines as: "How some of them can reject the enjoyment of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long walk for the hurston's thief without a targa and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclamate on Hurston of Robert E. Hemenway struggled the libraries, retroducing it into the American Canon.
The autostrade project came just while her famous daughter had again worked the lights of the rivalt.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston seen her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what it could destroy the state with its autostrade.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the commemoration.
Many years later, the state turned back from his project for the road.
"The five rounds of the resurrected autostrade have brought what would be said high speed, a real pride for the city," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd makes it easier: "He saved Eatonville."
The victory on the autostrade project has helped change the image that the city has.
Those from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come here in the church in 1993, began to appear in a long number, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville added to the public history record in 1998.
A new booking to a single piano (called as Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repavimented and pleasant.
Today, Eatonville remains a anonymy of Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the edge rain, small as when it comes with 27 black families in the 80s of 1800.
(It's 90% black today.)
Foreigners that are going to search for the story of Eatonville, for their meaning, are often treated with cautela.
A previous permission requested is requested for most of the interviews, to some things - like the walls on the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man, which are seeing black men in the fields - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for the brilliant red, are still afraid that their insulating community will be angry.
However, after the Hurston Festival has expanded, it is also a high level of citizen pride.
The young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and fair, creative, big worker, shock and confused as other ethnic races and groups in America.
It is sincerely citizens that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nipote, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, which intends to return to Eatonville after the colleague to work in the local government or for the police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old age from Winter Park, seemed to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"My people, if they just come here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all others," said Alondra Kenon after the messenger in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really close and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a pleasant city."
Here in New York, we're all talking flexibly about financing
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were far away from the newspapers and the great TV schemes of Times Square, they would not be aware of staying in the cycle's eyes.
They wouldn't be sure that the glass offices, in the upper tests, the bankers and the hedge back managers who monopolize New York every day live the worst "brush day in office" from the 1929 crown.
The factors skut metal carts for the way through the marshals, carrying muffin vacuums for feeding meetings.
Latin Americans cross the legs between condomes, bringing, such as human muds, 50 and shooting tracks, applies to a stone on their shoes.
The employees still wait in line for their moon bag at the boards of food on the swimming pools, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It didn't seem to have a real crisis, until, with all the discourses of ruin and tristeness, I decided to open a new free of juvenile resparm.
Even though I planned the fact in a way that was in line with the breakfast of the afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a chain of about twenty was already waiting in the line.
Not in front of the cash sport, to remove money or deposits, but on the front of the customer service sport, where old customers order assign as assignments, tourists ask directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are before me, I would then have learned from Starr, my "fidelity banker", were in line for my same reason.
Instead of me, however, they have already led the savings from the smallest banks from which they do the pendolars, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from such thrifts (e.g. a company of buildings), credit collaboratives and citizens' banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say to treat customers as families.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have fallen.
In the past days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in active, was submitted to the controlled administration, and the New Yorkians traveled to home for the end of the week, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion, was the search for a buyer who saved her.
The employees and workers who were in front of me, disappointed for another college, moved their money to a bank understood as a safe port, the bank that is demanding more guards at Wall Street.
The common newspapers in the last few weeks have become competent in financing.
A woman to my chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was reported to Lehman Brothers, the bank left in false failure, and her emerging director-General Dick Fuld in the whole family, as being shocked by a pig partner.
And Lyn, the uniform portainy of my condominie, has changed theme with regard to our normal discussions on Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
You told me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my market funds now!.
I have changed, I'm not running any risk."
Tombe musulman is prominent while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian Right Lake of the Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Party of the Right Vlaams Belang, took part in a manifestation to submit the organization "Città against Islamization" in April, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring types of the road representatives of Mosche with a red line that pass in the middle.
Police has condemned the extremists of the right to have disfellowshipped a musulman cemetery in Austria, the same week as the extreme right political parties have granted much to national general elections.
More than 90 tonnes have been seriously damaged to Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in some hour after Friday night and this morning, in which the police believed that it was an organised action.
The guilty has traced with the Jewish spray symbols like David's star over some tombs, but the detectives believed may have been an attempt to masquer the extremist motivations leading to a hatred for Islamic immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is linked to the elections in any manner.
A porter of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" from the news of propanion, which happened at the end of the Ramadan, month of religious relevance for the musulmans.
Austria, in frattempo, has been shipped in a spiritual search trip after his right execution in the parliamentary elections of last.
The two extreme right partys that have taken almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have done a campaign with such an anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans have been defined by the xenofobi critics.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, head of the Freedom Party who wins more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against vessels and burks, and also expressed its opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the end of Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties seem to band the construction of mosches and miners, in view of being political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Reviews and analysis made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, pointing out that the change was introduced predominantly by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Go to the outside interrupted to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the ice star of the guilty of sexual abuse on minors, was prohibited to travel in France and Spain from the court.
The judges imposed the prohibition of six months in Glitter after they informed the authorities that controlled him to want to go to Spain through France.
The prohibition of traveling to the outside was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after it was provided to the judges the evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse against minors.
Glitter, the true name Paul Gadi, was not present to the hearing of Ashford in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
The police of Kent submitted a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's journey in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not a person."
Glitter, 64 years of age, had informed the authorities to want to travel to the outside as requested by the registration of sentences for sexual crimes.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the outside for more than three days.
He is also requested to give the police a warning of seven days on his scheduled start date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence for five years of prison.
Kent's police said he didn't want to discuss the individual cases or the possible movements of Glitter in the country.
"The Kent Police Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or outside.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone remaining in the United Kingdom because we have complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police, and we work carefully to monitor the behaviour of the convictions for sexual crimes registered in the country to minimise any possible risk for the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnami prison for abusing two children of 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter came back to Bangkok where he had to ship up on a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't have done it to passport control, and at the end they took a flight for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities did not let him enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and the immigration officers insisted for returning to England.
At the end of Heathrow's terminal on 22 August, his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had succeededly asked for an order to enter it in the record of convictions for sexual crimes.
Glitter was previously incarcerated in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of child abuse.
One source of the Ministry of Internal Ministers said that Jacques Smith, the internal secretariat, felt safe and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling in France and Spain.
"Photograph the master far from the scene to extract the character" Sonther Bauer, photographer
No flight shoes swimming snacks from first.
Only the existence of the great masters of the flamenco, shocked by the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the appearance of the man or the woman.
One part of the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Two inseparable facts, except in the private, in those moments far away from the public, when the intimacy of a shooting, the depth of a shocked look or the expression of the hands, are natural because they must not go in scene.
The German Sonther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatrality of some shoes, balls and cytarists on the ball with the least known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photograph offers an original iconography of the flamenco, collecting it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, including in the programmement of the Photography Flamenco, reflects the international importance of this ball, every day more than it," explains the artist and explains that "Flamenco-People" could also be treated by common people, but by seeing the photos, the observer is not the typical images of artists, interpretations or executors on the scene.
These "too the way" people are "artists in the ability to transmit passion, tristeness, joy when they are in the scene ... and capture the public.
In order to cover the personality of these larges, it is not necessary to take them back in the scene,
Because their personality and characters are internal.
What I interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to catch with the photo machine the personality of the large of the flamenco."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long way to return to songs, chitarists or ballets using a photo machine.
They are retraced that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember the classic photo.
The application of various styleistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, conferring to the modernity photo, according to an idea that reflects the design of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the baller, the song or the sound in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, is able to conquer the public with its art.
Search of a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of hearing and being, are and were the continuing of this work, in exposure in these days at the galerie El Fotomata.
Famose artists of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Librijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente friends, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy retreated artists.
The project has become a kind of anhology of the flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the retreats exposed to the show.
The passion for the retreats has brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Vetern attractions" ("SportART Project").
While in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photograph accepted "I love to get people back, to know and to think for a moment in their life, this is a long or short moment.
I think the retraction is the most difficult one in the photo.
You meet or compare people, persons that sometimes don't know or give you just a few minutes to cut the photo.
Besides these circumstances, like a photograph, I always try to make my ideas."
The collection of retreats of the contemporary flamenco, titled "Flamenco-people" is allocated at the gallery El Fotomata, on the Number 20 of the Mata, parallela to the way Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Lloa reveals that the Roman that she writes is a "azarde"
It is environmental in places that have not yet known and dealing with unknown arguments: Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taking with a new project he works, a Roman whose protagonist Roger Casemant is a Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and has crossed the Amazonian.
Since it is always favorable for the Nobel Prize for Letteratura, the writer has condemned yesterday at Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project of which he is employed today is "is a snare" and that "all indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to end it as soon as long," he concluded his intervention to the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days have seen a hundred writers, historical, journalists and thousands of people through the city of Akchedotto.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was, as pronostics, the figure of spy to the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who wins Hay Festival's premium to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of the "Our mutual friend" book of Dickens, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Felix Romeo, the writer was found before a public who was shooted the time when the Peruvian, with a great memory of humorism, revoked as a nak in him the letterary vocation, resulting in the "excellent adventure" of the "aventure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as written in "mode disciplined" to provide the "mankind of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, ration and continuation; such as Faulkner, Victor and Alexandr Dumas have influenced his vocation and "the image of the memory" as the basis of its accounts.
The Spanish-American Romanist, acknowledged that "no way" was to measure and to know whether books can change the life of people, "but I refused to believe that literature is a pure intriguing, an effective experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, supporting that, on the contrary, "he has the effects" and that "returns the most anti-conformist people". Therefore, he invited the writers to "no stop to competitive" and to "support the responsibility" of their vocation.
The time ostacles the Festival of Pozoblanco, privacy of the courses
The celebration of the flights that would have to suggest the days of Pozoblanco Festival was suspended last morning, after the towers selected for the rounds had been verified that the conditions of the soil were not appropriate.
Therefore, the society, in accordance with Fertin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the course celebration.
The temporarys were shocked against this Festival by preventing two days to celebrate on three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second round of tors.
In the carton Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, which would have had to face a catylblanco tower.
Thus, the Festival had regularly performed only on Thursday.
In this occasion, Daniel Luke was trionfare, cut three ears and came out in trionf, after having turned out with sweet and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talvanting has brought its two courses to end by rescue health and one ear, given more from the public than for the same course.
The worst among all was The Juli, passing from the area of Los Llanos without glory and without punishment.
With the second tower, after a tremendous mule, the fishes of the public were winned.
A bus with two miles away from Hahish over the block place in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The agents swallow up to the two employees of a truck, instead of stopping themselves.
The agents shocked the top to the two employees of a truck, instead of stopping, data on the escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason to not stop.
The agents after they have followed, they can arrest one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., as reported in the report of the Department of Internal Government.
The arrested person is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some of the road officials of Alava were conducting a control of transport on the N-1, where this crossed the common surrounding of Armiñon.
They arrived to stop a car for the inspection when the driver, infringing the commands, accelerated brushly and overlooked the blocking place.
The agents have been data on the control until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road border, and their two employees have been data to escape in a forest area.
The Emerzantza agents have thus been able to arrest one of the flights and to defeat the 2.178 kilograms of hashish that carried and took it once inspected the truck, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pants, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were then taken under the police custody for a deep investigation and the detection of the weight.
Furthermore, since the officials acknowledged that the matrix was "duplicated" because it did not match that reported in the documentation of the truck, the arrest was also imputed by the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate to arrest the second suspected person, which has been able to escape as it has said, and to determine the origin of deceased drugs.
Detention A. A. J., 28 years old, was carried out to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge within the following hours.
Stop the actor Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of medicines
The actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the effect of medicines.
A Witness saw it to perform risky hands while trying to get out of the parking in Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People from a californian road portal.
The witness indicated that around 16.30 the Locklear was shooting the accelator, making very laugh, and trying to take the car out of the parking with brush hands before and back. Returned, he passed again in front of his eyes of sun."
Shortly later, the witness, who first seen, apparently had not recognized the actor, saw that the Locklear was stopped in a near road and was out of the vehicle.
It was the person to enhance emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patch arrived, he found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which locked the road partly.
"That seemed confused," and because of this, agents took it to a specialist centre for drug use and alcohol to submit it to a test.
According to a police portion, the actor has been cooperative, and the hypothesis of the alcohol outcome has been shocked until the beginning, although "sing as observed by the officers at first, we believe that the Locklear was under the effect of a few medicines."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspect of guidance under the effect of some substances not better specified and was sent to the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being reconverted after an anxiety and depression episode.
Appeals calls for the Danish Federation of the UU to take its responsibility in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator of the Izquererda Unida Party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that he will take a decision on the case of the former agency to the Youth and Sport of the Community of Siviglia, France Manuel Silva, which has signed the demissions last week following the accused of customerism.
"In these cases, they are particularly federalist, and it will be the Danish organization to take his own responsibility," said Mr Blazares in respect of the resolution that the party will have to adopt with respect to what has been until today in the Siberian Council.
However, the UI leader highlighted the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI has always wanted that this kind of investigation we have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, it stressed that training is regulated by "extreme ethical codes for all public carriages".
"May's Sangre", the epic shock of Garci
Inspirating the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdoos, Jose Luis Garci reprotes in Sangre de May the famous revolte of Spanish people against the Frenchs, in which it is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the register tried to "exhibit the torrent of personalities and at the same time the social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the famous Romanize, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevar would be headed by a wide box of interpretations.
May Sangre, over two hours and half, debuts this Friday in film sales, to become a television ministerial over four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirant of the literature of Galdoos, Jose Luis Garci claims that he had done with this round "a dream of his childhood", and he believed to be grateful for Esperanza Aguirre, which was commissioned by the Community of Madrid three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centuries of May 2, the register had accepted agreement that the history of the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets funded throughout the Madrid Community represented for Garci a "single opportunities" to re-establish the scenographs and costs to take up a "a stored Spanish that has failed the choice of the leadership to fight and the fact that the fight for independence brought the people a great delay in development under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII".
However, the register has not received financing compared to those of Alatrists or the Fans of Goya - more than double than Sangre de May, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the scene that he himself had signed together in Horacio Valcarcel, co-operator of almost all his carriage.
This, for the register of Volver to start, has influenced what is its habitual work practice, the scene table with the actors, with which it often uses to try to turn together to those who do not part of the cast, because it is considered "excellent", considers that "Part of the work of the registry resides in the theatre and the film to know what happens in the field where it works".
Many of the interpretations, part of which they are in the Sangre box of May, try to face their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate at Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no of the three candidates films to represent Spain this year at the Holywood Academia - his Sangre of May, you are French bill tables and, the last chosen Cyclope -, do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "what should be known instead".
From this film, Garci doesn't wait for prize.
"In the beginning you believe to work for posters, then realize that work is only for prosperity, and at a certain point you agree to just turn a film in more", explains Garci after over 30 years of carriage.
Isabel Bayon recognises the siblical essence of the Tortola Valencia Balleria
A sivilian ballet makes an opposition to another Siviglia's same ballet.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, the catalano father (Firenze Tortola Ferer) and the andalusa mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the neighborhood of Triana, and three years old, she was transferred with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballet and a specialist in Eastern Dance.
He conducted a lovely life and was a pioneer of the women’s emancipation, the calibre of Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the curse that prevented women from move freely.
The life of this woman, who signed a revolution in the field of dance and ethics in Europe between the two wars, has always affected Isabel Bayon.
"I would like to work with Pepa Gamboa and you offer me this personality. I'll be incredible."
Support the ballet: "We do not want to tell your whole life, but collect the spirit.
His dance titles suggested me some basic elements of the flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the mariposa" suggested me a giant, or "the snack's dance" some tanks.
His dance was sensitive, and it was said to me that my way to ball into this stage," explains.
The scene table provides two exceptional contributions: the Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as faced in "Open door"; and that of Master Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanting to work with the one who was his allieve.
"Matilde interprets Tortola by adult, the personalisation of maturity.
I'm happy because you accepted working in my work, and I feel very honourable."
The dedication also includes the composition of music and citarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, Puga and Moi di Morón; the convictions of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfran Juárez "what interprets the role of eternal composer of these artists who have been struck to all, and who have always had many spasimans".
In the work, it is also present in some way the life of this woman, which is located in distant places, especially for that era, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole Europe, because it was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it's one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historic period, and now nobody remembers it and no one considers her worker as something of value," supports Bayon.
The spectacle will start today at 20:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" the Triennium is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencasado" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where John Ramon Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, includes the activities of the Assistant to the Judge of Anndalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fifty-year anniversary of the assignment of the Nobel Prize for literature and death of both sides.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ended with the redistribution of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the enthusiast "Joan Ramón Jiménez: On that light chop," which has been inaugurated last May and that after touching the various provinces of Anndalusia, it will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Assistant to the Cultural of the Board of Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated", in the care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the distribution of the figure and work of one of the enalous poets of higher value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Atimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of the actor Sally Field, which I'll lay with him in "Ausance of Maliciousness" and gives the idea of the impossibility of the American movie, and from all the Americas, in front of the uncomfortable idea that Newman has gone.
But he was very costing to give him a Oscar.
And since 2007 it was in pension.
And he also knew that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard shock for everyone.
"Something that a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid of being ridiculous or exagered.
He died a father of the film and patriarch in a specially dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-stimate of the American people to land, the desperate search of new motivations to feel dignity.
When the times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain good people to admire, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he incarnated the ideal platform of beauty and truth.
He was an official opposer of Richard Nixon and defender of loss and twenty-five causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first dead age of overdose to the creation of a married and biological food mark.
Everyone gives a country to which it is costly going over a suicide food culture.
The wagon was over Hollywood, without being curated, nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the English English Daniel Craig, observed that he wasn't killed a man, ended a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, registered with the Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the appointment of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, has shocked to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of high level for us all," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few people who are trying to live today as Paul Newman did: maintaining high consideration the need of correction and having a serious and distant private life on cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in the mediatic jungla today.
However, some try us, and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once, but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, where he remained faithful, unless he certainly missed the opportunity to not be it.
"Why today I'm going to eat out of the hamburger, if I have a bike at home?" said to smile.
In the heavens it is the honour that his daughters are also his amateurs, which is not so common in America.
"For all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was so proud of the man who was devoted, lovely father, grandfathered and filantrous,," they say.
The imperfect course of a Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or later the Olympics will stay in Madrid and, after the trial failed for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I ask you, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the course of yesterday, say no!
They called it the "perfect course", but I think it's been the worst of which you have assisted.
A lot of shocks, which if later were taken into consideration for the evaluation and I would have to review it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go for order and start from the beginning.
The shocks have started with the dorsale retreat, which presumed that they were going first.
It wasn't a wrong idea, but if you're going to go, it's to remove everything (you the chip to avoid the codes during the guest).
Instead not.
You had to go only to take the dorsale (only shock, go only for this) and (more the relative shock), surprise! they had only shocks 'S' (second crazyness, because I need a XL table).
In what world we live?
Is it a crisis if they have decided to purchase only small tissue, made with smaller tissue and therefore less costs?
However, things of this kind are ineces compared to the same day of the course.
Besides going very fast to take the chip, the waiting chain was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the seed.
The waiting is over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a course to which more than 11.000 people are expected.
So, as was predictable, the course began that we had not yet deposited the sand, although, once the company was successful, the recovery also was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which trials were added to popular rebellion and shooted to the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pulmonary, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct order class because of Chip, I think I will not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will not be sure in my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream a well prepared olimpica city.
Microsoft Search Recipientist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emergency technologies, Microsoft first presented a new system of recognition of the image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intellectual, but without a lot of intelligence, in order to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a tax (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shipping service to move inside the society camp) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and volts, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - even remembering their position in the company - and listening and understanding key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the present groups in conversations groups.
In the video, for example, the receptiveist is a third person, but it is not a group with whom he is talking and that he is not a company employer.
Ask if it's there to make someone visit and tell you that you'll be at your short.
All without blue screen.
It's impressing.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better focus on which it is, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week has been very talking about a strategic change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be reader and you will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that, if the computers were equipped with the essential and less loaded business spacing functions, they would be five times faster – yes! Steve, will be "the less".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, after version has continued to add to Windows functionality and "extra".
The direction change is appreciable.
Microsoft has right: the operational system is always more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many correctly stress that a browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is an essential element to ensure the communications software.
Complete the same function of your wife or husband when you have something to say to your wives.
It's true.
It will never miss, but it may be necessary to think about the "more" of the operational system, not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Balmer said this week confirms this idea.
People make a less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
You're taking the computer only to start Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we're going to pass more time by navigating online than in a remote window environment.
What is the half of the applications of the operational system?
It's less than more.
And Windows 7 must be less, very less than Vista.
Weak, less sovereign, less complex.
Microsoft is interested in integrating its online services to make a valid Google alternative.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and report here a small example.
I kicked the photo entered in this post in one of the recreation places for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the bibting machine, a card calls them to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to perform a network research.
Last week, from the rest, the delay was confirmed in the development of the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if it is not added in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to join Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is increasingly a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminal.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso put her in the Costa Azzurra, Leonardo de Caprio launched in 'Diamant of Blood' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola, in addition to being part of the typical uniform of muscle gay.
And if we try to list the star appearances, we can revoke the image of the forzote with the shooting baths that took the weights in the ambulant circo.
It is, in substance, the typical slept by man, with the inside of cotton, cut down and without hands.
It's the 'tank', as they call it the anglophones, even if the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel split over all.
The "Marcel" is excellently compared to the other for the high quality of the coton, for its unix thick, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian flag (as recognisable), which the most emblematic models of the skin lead as details on the ball.
The "Marcel" is excellently compared to others for the high quality of the coton, for its unix thick, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian band (reconciliable), which the most embleming sleeves models lead as details on the ball.
And care, because the production of this Belgium is not only about the famous "tank".
They also purchase fat for the college, boxer boxer, boxer cards, cotton pants, marine pants, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimate inductions thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate whiteer.
I'm too nice.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate don't worry."
The great likeness with her sister did not prevent you to develop his personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today, the sisters Cruz have taken very seriously their new activity in modest field.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and fascinations that give their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the sign Mango made from his new place, in addition to the presentation of the most important prices than the Spanish mode house sponsorized.
Calm and horrible, you get fast.
Tell us you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we thought of my sister Penelope and I for the Sunday Winter season of Mango, and also to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner to the Opera in the Honour of Valentino.
We say, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotive.
From which elements are your new collection for Mango in this fourth workshop for Spanish house?
Yeah my sister, and I like the movie of the 50s' 60s, we've got several inspirations from here.
Then, I like to lose me in the city and to observe how they clothe women, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do it.
Ballerina, actor and styleist, you're a very gentleman, right?
I believe that, even though at the end, everything is confused and there are many elements in common.
To me, at the end of the little, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandfather's house to bread in the arms of my tea and to see his habits.
It was a bomb. It was even better to go to the game park.
Then, once ballet, I always took a lot of attention to the clothes.
You know that the ballets really like to have a own style to go to lesson and wisdom, to look at the eye and feel good.
And in the role of the actor, when you deliver the lookoba is the time you really meet the personality.
So everything goes together, yes, with very respect for the styles and professionals.
Not a long time ago, you've been 30 years old, you're in a crisis?
But no.
I never feel better, I like the 30-year-old idea.
I find that women are mature and they have a good experience to get the life that makes less wrong.
Biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to be small, and this gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'll be Mom because I ask my own body and I want to be a young mother, that's not me to lose it.
As regards the candidate, I'm not worried too much.
What I'm going to do will give great happiness to my son and educe him with very love.
With regard to the film, you're in waiting that scan into various films rounded last year.
I do so, and I've got a lot of wants they're scattering.
As a woman that comes from the theatre, I'm very inquired and worried, I'd like to be right now and in a clear way, but it can't always be like that.
I want to cut "The last hour" and "Search for the Tube of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like
A few days ago, you cut on a passenger with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say so.
It's not that I'm going to pass like a model.
Similarly, Naomi Campbell, who I know for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a shilling of benefit for his organization "Dones for a better world" and the habitats that we have provided – I brought two parts of our collection for Mango - have been put to the stage to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this sweet side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I know you from a long time I can confirm you that I'm not so true.
In addition, I find this good part in which you're involved.
He asked me to smile for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pipe, I would have done it equally.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't get back.
Recipient alcohol drivers must install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internals requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive alcohol rates in the blood, install in their car the system which prevents the drive of the vehicle in a fat or if they do not suffer in the device.
The measures have been announced last June and are already included in the annual report of the State General Prosecutor, according to which it will be a pilot project for a year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will be to attend a curso of reactivation on the road.
To this initiative, along with the Strategy Security Research, the Directorate-General of Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the car drivers signed more than one time for driving in the state of ebrity returns to drive the car.
Alcolock would prevent it, because it is a vehicle linked to measuring the alcohol rate in the inspired air and prevents the car if the driver does not suffix, or when it is detected a higher alcohol concentration than that permitted.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged by the sanctionate.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that the furniture vehicles of such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the life of 115 people per year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: bringing them to these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate the development, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary way, and, without doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even though it has already been introduced in a experimental way in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow the Congress will vote to a PSOE initiative in which this system is proposed to be installed in school bus, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With the UK point, at 17.40, the second program, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturi principles traveled at the presidential hagar at the Bento Juárez City airport.
The sun was walking, but the rays still strike to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple out of the air.
At the foot of the shop, the Spanish Ambassador and the other authorities.
Some time before I asked a taxist, for the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize a official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're out of here or...
- No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
The Mexican print, however, knows who are the principles of the Asturies and the importance of the travel.
Many who are waiting for shooting the airport shooted on the red shooting and the military coron of 27 marine soldiers offering honour.
The principle appears to be ridden, clothes in sea blue, and she, the princess, called the wind, very sweet, does not use its usual "peep-toes", may have told him that the city of Mexico threatened bad time.
Regular to the photos a smile and a short shock before passing into the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
Pressing the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest city's, waits for a spiritual reporter of the Mexican television.
The best prize offered by mode
Probably there is no place in the world the most appropriate to present a modest prize, not Paris and probably there is no more disquisite and good living styleist in Valentino.
Mango just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to promote the international promotion of new talents in the mode.
Provision of a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the Vetrine of Mango at the 54th of Boulevard Housesmann in Paris and almost cryed from the emotion.
In addition, it is the second largest negotiation in Europe and was just opened with 1.335 square square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, joined with the desire of enjoying the Valentino styleist who presided in the court of the concours, had started with a luce dinner at the Operator Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest squisite tele from Chagal, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the underlying heart and doing the right needs, because of the last death of the brother, has put a custom of the House and some supplements of ELAH to remove the fiat and the arm of the son Luis - a boy of almost two meters of height - has accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the east dinner.
Andik, owner and Mr. Mango, made the house honors and horsemen who has been finished, together with the Barone Rotchil, without jacket, because they both had cast them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who has managed the shop in pantalons and shops – drawn from his hand – has transformed for the dinner, inducing a very sensible black habit and emoted during the night journey with Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for bathrooms and you, remembering other times, took up a bar and stood a "great more".
Ines Sastre has not stopped walking in the places of the palace, but he had shown us the photos of his son on the cell.
The next day we are grateful for the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boyfriend who moved in motor - and John Travolta, who had arrived to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his lenses, his assumers and was assured before, that we had not been sweet in his room.
A place under the sky of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1.000 but 1.000 and a way to forget the caotic and frenetic life daily.
And as if it wasn't enough, they're all collected into a book that will bring relax into books on September 30.
The wave is almost a punishment when he swims every morning at 7:00, but it is even worse to imagine himself in the frenetic rythm of modern life.
The office calls tension and the computer's bad shirt.
Strength is the evil of the 21th century.
However, there is no one and even two methods to fight daily exacerbating and the difficulty to disfellowship from the world of work.
No, this number has nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Besides Yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects on the pages of its book, all a "menu" of options on measure for a pleasant and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax themselves" and its calm will reach books thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer peace in ambitions such as the worker or in personal relations, this "manual" means that conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural receipts that contribute to relax.
If adrenaline doesn't already pass in your winds to find the body's balance and stress has become a problem, it is the time to sit on the dwelling, spend the mind and focus on reading.
Talk in Sound
Some kids speak during the night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very shocked to tell us something happened in the previous day, but to the children who speak to stay sleeping.
The first time that happens, at most, a fear is taken, but in fact it is not very important.
This is a good change of the sound defined somniloquie.
It appears with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have told you that you had spoken in the sleep.
This phenomenon can be very sporatic (one time in life, for example associated with a high febre episode) or with a more regularity (day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sound disorders such as incubics, night fears, night-to-speaking shoes, or soundambulism, but not necessarily so.
As previously indicated, it can be associated with high feb stages, with stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In any case, it's still a little studyed phenomenon.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice tone, with sweet words, almost in a suspicious or that happens the contrary (urla, cry, long talking ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be to observe the child and to consult a specialist to check whether there is a question that generates an anonymous state of anxiety as a shock to the situation.
We have said that this is a good alternation, therefore, does not exist treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g., if accompanied with insomnious or stress situations).
However, what can be done is taking into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exceed the child exceedingly before you go to sleep.
Propose peaceful games and avoid television programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for which it is fatigue to relax, you can use relaxing techniques to help them get a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreams appear to try to keep calm.
Remember that I'm uncomfortable for the child and that the day afterward you will not remember anything about what happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake up.
It's not useless, because it is not aware of what happens, and you'll stop the sleep.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping, and then she's relaxing.
Remember that it appears very awesome and episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to check out where such anxiety is in the child.
If you understand what you say (who it is not the most common situation), do not fall in the attempt to make him a questionnaire to get information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleeping and therefore not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what you're saying but not to see what you're dreaming to say, so you need to take much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they can bring.
You never tell the child you could ask him for questions during the night to know his secrets.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A thing like that causes a huge anxiety.
Soon, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that keeps just a few minutes.
Elieuser... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of the victory in house after a long-term infruction.
Without playing a formable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming them one in the victory of the game.
The ritm was not very supported during this meeting in which the attackers were expressed to factic.
After a first trial of the host of the Kauffmann host who tried the seven with a loose shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of the hamerary, Funterflick from lounge, then high Hirn, Romein of point and Debold.
The shamemary answered with a lock in the center, left only Riahi shocked in a attack point.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed in Riahi and Time for the Wednesday, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, reprened a ball resisted to a first attempt of Debold (53').
But the Illhaeusern can't take his happiness long and will be exploded a twenty-five minutes after that leaveing his team team companies in numerical lowerness.
But the shamemary will not be able to use it and will not bring great problems to the Illhaeusern Foreigners, just identified to "reforze" the defense, except in the last few minutes of game when, after a rocky action, the ball was cut through.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in collera
Before you go to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will kill in Britain.
In front of the demonstration of fishermen who have cruelly prevented access to several bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to take place on Monday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère Department, to encounter the representatives.
They have promised to accept it "with constructive spirit" and hope that they are present with concrete proposals.
A presidential visit that will take place in the same time with the General Assembly of the "Crise Committee", created by the Bretton fishermen to take steps to face the price of gas oil, which has reached its record with a average of EUR 1.14 per litro.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's vow, the President will discuss with them the possible solutions to help enterprises to restore competitiveness and to make sure the working conditions and the repayment of the marine."
Fishermen wait Nicolas Sarkozy to shut up.
Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumaca operations" in Morbian and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of angry.
Also, Quiberon's port has been blocked, but the links with the Belle Island have not been interrupted.
On the Quiberon Penis, a road block has been implemented.
On Monday, the marine have already proved their determination burning from the alba, pneumatics and palettes before the carburant deposits at Brest and Lorient's ports, while taking feet of manifestations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where fishers remained on the moon, or in Havre, where a twenty-five boats prevented the movement of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Crossic, at the Atlantic Loira, have interrupted the block of the Total Raffinage Note of Donges at night.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they have decided to wait for the meeting that will be held to the Ministry to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "Crise Committee" will actually decide on the future action of the movement and possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Brazilian fishermen do not want to be represented by the members of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support the movement.
"The skipper will continue" because "the fishermen will not cease" and "do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who are not paying taxes on the gas oil, are currently paying about 50 centimeters per litro, but estimate that the income limit of a packaging will be reached only with a gas oil lower than 0.30 euros per litro.

The Borsa of New York has accused of a historic crown on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives were expressed against the Paulson plan for the saving of the financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, or a calamity ever seen, close to 800 points, and Nasdaq on 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10.365.45, below 777.68 points.

Demoralized at the beginning, Wall Street is depressed after the unexpected refusal of the bank salvation plan, thought to restore the stability to the market.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 votes, representatives rejected the funding required by the Minister of Teacher Henry Paulson.
About two Republicns on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress incapable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how the project market was counted", added, fearing that in some days it may already be "be too late" to take one.
"If the project was actually dwelling (...) then the testimony would soon be passed to Fed – Federal Reserve - (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would be further limited to credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And considering the state of emergency,” every day that leads to the crowd of a financial institution in the United States, stressed the Piegza.
After the fall of Washington Mutual on Thursday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival City Group.
In Europe, the crisis has slowly accelerated the emergency intervention for the United Kingdom banks, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signing that the markets "not only face a American crisis but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial Analyst.

Obama in benefit of the first double television
After the first debate of Thursday between the two candidates at the White House, it was a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republic and Democratic campaign have announced the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, although meritable, was not enough to allow him to swim the calf in the five-week surveys from the presidency.
The Gallup Institute, where a sabbath public opinion survey grants a benefit of five points in Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democratics had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive electors, found that 39% of them believed Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
An excellent performance by his companion of the Joe Biden list, expected during the first and unique debate with the Barrier Sarah Palin, should confirm the benefit of Obama.
"Stobathing her would be a mistake.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventeenth McCain has never stopped promoting its inconsistent experience in the field of external policy, stressing the "ingecurity" of the opposite regarding the arguments faced during the first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand what." He often declared many recurrences.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and skills necessary to become President," said.
This is a continuous shock for the Republicn television campaign.
Obama, from his song, emphasized how his choice would represent a new future.
Without extending, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its pre-disposition to the right decisions and the intention of restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, on the other hand of Obama," he recovered this weekend, a democratic spot, reproving the Republic of not to take the necessary measures to face the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the new minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battle rain, for an electional meeting.
He has not even expressed the words "mediate" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the top of the precipitation.
"The next week could represent a decisive execution," he considered, yesterday, the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Administration, compared the establishment of Obama in economic matter to the demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crowd "it's the final green after eight years of economic pessimm adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming the intention of reducing taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the suspects of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among its priorities the achievement of an eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the provision of a health insurance system.
McCain would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
The two candidates have slaughtered the questions focused on the financial savings plan of $770 billion (470 billion) adopted last night the Congress and extremely impopolated.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Youth and opposites showed Sunday night in the main plage of the Belarus capital to react in advance the results of the legislatives.
Some hundreds of Belarus gathered Sunday night after the closure of the election seats in the central plage of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young people were coming to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictor, divisions".
Some condemn that they have not even voted : "To what pro, so they will do what they want, from my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the scheme that has made an excellent figure of foreign observers in order to re-elect in dialogue with the European Union is ready to take up a democratic execution.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 bielorusian leaders and the congelation of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
It wasn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been displaced by the election committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the votes'", he regretted Youri Potemkine, portal of the Union of Democratic Forces, a eterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a fashion change, emphasized Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of opposition to the Presidents of 2006 and the head of the pro-European movement, because the important one is who accounts for the schedules and in this case is the executive.
If the deputy of the opposition comes to Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their income in Parliament can lead to a television space, regional meetings and law proposals."
The opposition therefore has the obligation to enter into the political game because "I must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is debtly debt to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we can become a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the security and cooperation organization in Europe, which has followed the election process, recognizes the validity of the scrutiny.
It underlines that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the elections in Minsk) has given the way to each type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Do you ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August?
There was no one at the election seats.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to the Parliament, the most convenient to the power."
The night silence falls on October's place.
In television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are welcomed by their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. FrancineDécary, had all the reasons for rejoicing, because Hema-Québec has become one of the most secure and effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it has recovered the public's trust, seriously affected by the scandale of the infected blood in the 1980s to 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of the acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and the C hepatitis.
In front of this drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, directed by the Judge Horace Crever, which aimed at lighting on the circumstances that have brought to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the reproportion of a similar disaster.
While the Judge Krever late to style a report, some provinces have undertaken a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gelineau Committee.
After the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood (Canada Society of Blood) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his activities, only 38% of the people claimed to feed yet trust in the gift system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Decary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood prejudicies and research in the course of the following years, we recovered the public's trust,” explains pride that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population had now confidence in the Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary is convinced that "the confidence is something of extremely fragile."
By the end of its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, he was attended in Europe in many cases of the human diversity of the much pazza, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's morbe, reports colleagues that it was the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we did not absolutely know whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelinau reports that when there are doubts and may be a serious disease, in this case the morbe of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is demonstrated with a degeneration of the brain that is inevitable to die, they take out of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had passed over one month in the United Kingdom was rejected since 1980.
Now, for a few years, it has been proved that this disease is transmitted through infected blood without any doubt.
This episode has so proved to us that he had a sense to apply the principle of precaution."
In 1999, a more effective technique for HIV identification was appeared on the market: the tests of the nuclear acid (TAN) which allow to recognize the presence of the virus and not the antibodies that were based on the tests that had been used until then.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. the time when the person has contracted the disease to which the first viruss can be identified in blood thanks to our technical, the specialist explains.
The period could be reduced to a less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not able to identify them therefore is so significantly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contrary to AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, a person on 12 million runs the risk of receiving infected blood from HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by HIV virus.
As Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood samples, we will want more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with transfusion.
I believe today you can feel quiet in receiving or prescribe blood transfusion to recover health, says the Hema-Québec head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products security.
You never know how pathogen will emerge in the system.
After a year ago on the Reunion Island the Chikungunya virus, which, as the West Nilo virus, is transmitted to blood from an insect.
It must be constantly monitored," continues Dr. Decary before emphasising that in addition to safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient delivery.
"The needs increase because old population is.
As a more aggressive cancer care, patients often need a delivery of red and plasma globes.
The people's ageing also has the consequences of the number of donors which in average are only 3% of the people of Québec acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have been undertaken 18 years and responding to the admissibility criteria, however, may give the blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the meantime, 14% of those offered as donors are not accepted, because AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where this last is public, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventary ability to respond to the hospital needs.
The pension cases are very rare.
But it must be renewed by the members of this group of donors, which they old and can't do don't.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give the blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so frenetic today that it is difficult to give the blood a hour,” says the deluge Francine Decary.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec does not only distribute blood samples, but also human tissue, including osses, ocular heart valves and skins that are used almost exclusively for serious uses.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at the Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of the ombelical blood coron in Quebec.
In the ombelical coron, which once had been considered a biomedical cut, a rich blood of staminal cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"We've been celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank input of our millennium blood sample and we're expecting to preserve more than thousands each year.
It should be started to proportion for trapants at the beginning of the next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this practice of blood prelige of coron as very popular.
"Thank of Mothers are disappointed that you can't have access," because Hema-Québec does not have any means to offer this complex and cost-building program in all the hospitals of Quebec.

There was a beautiful ovation."
Search point to the North
The first Minister does not exclude the start of elections before the end of the year.
I concluded the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest was held yesterday in Jean-Talon, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu, (a left), tries to be elected at the time of today's partial elections.
"Applicate the borders of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments of the strong visual impact, at the time of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mullino to Images".
On three mass schemes, there were negative spectaculars of hydroelectric diges, mineral cultivations, Quebec images saw with "Google Maps", cartinas, etc.
Great means as in full election campaign.
During the press conference, the first minister has refused to exclude the start of Sunday elections, even though he noted that he was very commitmented.
The North Piano is the fourth point of a "project" which the first minister says to have for the Quebec, the of a 'new economic space', which includes a first agreement with France on the handwork, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with the Ontario.
It is often appointed in the recent discussions of the First Minister, the opening of the northern territories to the 49th parallel – never was subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was limited to explain why the North would be "a joy of the great potential", but has not been expressed as regards temporary or investment quotas, as it has not explained how they will be the precise priorities in the achievement of future projects.
It has been the most limited to notify what it looks at a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mineral sector, which, due to the growth of emergency countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced different improvements.
According to the styled list of Charest, the North contains" nichel, zinc, rame, platin, gold, gold, gold, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
The "great territory of France" is here, is Quebec.
It is not only here, but it's in us," he insisted, how to encourage a national founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in their relationship with the North and highlighted: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Baia of James.
"Found to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatre break to see the immense card on his shoes.
North, 70% of the Quebec territory, including a part of the Labrador who has always revended, has specified the first minister during the print conference.
"It's a traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity is presented, I will reverse the position in the name of the government," said.
On the other hand," considers the climate changes, it must be assessed the North," said the passing of the Northwest, which will be open for the whole year because of the smoothing of yellows.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister estimates that the territory is a duty.’
And the people of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister stated that the Quebec Government would show its attention to this matter and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of the young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Leturneau (ex-deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already given the way to the consultation of a thirty community.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Traports and Natural Rises) employed a significant load of work.
The first minister does not exclude a great meeting", not necessarily a summit, but a moment in which "common visions" will be provided."
Northern development would have the rest of the principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be concerted, ordered and respected by the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with the first liberal ministers that have before it.
"Come the previous liberals, we know we distinguish to transform the challenges into new occasions of growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was started on Thursday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to restore the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, in Leage that nationalized the hydroelectricity, in Bourssa, the Creator of Baia James, our party has always learned to force the future", stated Jean Charest.
During the print conference, it is recognised to another reference, conserver this time, the "Start to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric digest, Charest specificated that its functional mission would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains among us, but I feel that we do it," admitted his warriors, urging applause.
In fact, the first minister, who said in April, would not have been elected in 2008 and probably even in 2009, did not miss the possibility of starting an autumn scrutin, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He underlined to be very compromised, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council on the end of the week has provided to the Liberal Chief a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" which have been linked as oil: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the "quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
It is also hoped that the Québec names the members of the Council on radiodiffusion and Canadian telecommunications and that they have a right to visa on decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the abbozzo of the North Piano has been accepted in a sceptic way.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has grown the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
The liberal government, coming to power in 2003, would not respect the application.
If it had been done," we would be progressed today" commented Marois next to the candidate of Jean-Talon (excluding today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the Government.
"What we hope is that all of this is not simply understood as a spectacle," commented the leader Sebasten Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, instead of the holidays today.
Letter - A Unknown country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of "Giusty" of Harper's office, to allow himself to declare, the past summer, that Louise Arbor was a "truck" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who has struggled instantly for justice and who merge all our admiration is very much about the end of the Prime Minister, as well as on the same Stephen Harper.
It is in front of a government that is the only, among all western countries involved, to have not repatriated his citizen in the concentration field of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple adolescent at the time of the facts that he was sent.
The only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, rejects his own word and lets march a slow child in human conditions.
The only one that trusts in a parod of justice to establish the guilty of the accused.
We remember, on the basis of information, that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Order of Canadian lawyers, in particular, calls the repatriation of Omar Khadrafnich to be subjected to a regular process in Canada.
It is just the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it is very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, maybe forever, after many years of suffering.
It is not yet understood, but we are assisting an incredibly erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", saying that Harper does not stop ottening and sound so insensitive about his lab.
Here we arrived at the moment where there is no more morality: it can be maltrated, tortured, arbitraryly implying a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a government leader until today of minority (to see what it will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that a party that preaches the Virtual, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents the salvation: they do not see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's just here, Mr. Toews, in the decline of all this, and there's no other part.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian talk
In the edition of 17 September, Le Dever published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Company Barrick Gold.
As a result of an orwellian logic, this latter says that the largest aurifer company in the world has sported a chair for dismissing six million people against three authors and a small editor house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and imparcial, it is not the truth that they judge, above all in the case of a chair for dismissation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to the ruin whoeverever is to support its opposite position.
Unlike the outcome of the process, writers and editors of the Black Canada book, there will be a cospicous sum of money to organize their defence and fight, to weapons decisively learning, against a lawyer arm financed by the funds of the mineral company.
On the other hand, in these fights to learn weapons, the tactic is often to destroy the agreement in order to introduce a consensual regulation which implies the opposition in addition to fearing anybody or another to speak on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public view that would have had to present its vision of facts.
On the contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates are in Canada in line with the exchange of opinions and not on the smell.
It would therefore be sufficient that the company opened its books, its documents, and set up a real and self-debat, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent researchers, which would be able to make light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in the public view and rejects the requests and letters for support of the Canadian authors.
Maybe Garver could explain how to ask a public "debat" when his disrespect for the same public is quite clear?
In the world of the Vice-President, this word seems only to be indicated by the lawyers who have been originally paid and not the whole of the Canadians; this is a very limited vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even delegators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero makes it first because he rejects the brutal means adopted by the mineral company.
This public is ready to listen to the Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchange of opinion, and not in the optic of what many understand as a kind of smuggling (researching the "public debate", the Barrick Gold just gave to the authors of Canada Nero a lasttum intimidating them to sustain the use of that word...)
Besides the surreal talk of Garver, the chairman sported by the Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the persecution of the truth, essential in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote of authentic sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is not possible to study and discuss on dismothing issues in the world's richest enterprises, many of them may be able to do so, who will?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, it could be possible to follow the scientific standards as they do the authors of the Black Canada.
He has the right to replicate.
For a long time, the university environment, from which we are part, is able to manage debates and disputes and to solve conflicts.
The overwhelming measures of the Barrick Gold clearly show that, in contrast with its claims, it does not find a transparent debate.
This goes away from the university world, as it considers the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to be able to restrict abuse desires.
Operation - Saving for Wall Street – Dialogo between Republicans and Democratics
The Bush administration and the chief of the Congress, representatives of the Republic and Democratic slaughter, finally arrived to an agreement on the largest rescue-financing plan after the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion American dollars, which aims to bring a train to the financial crisis that has been recorded for months on Wall Street, must still be ratified by the two Congress rooms.
It provides, in particular, a verification of its effective action by election leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases covered for lack of payments, as well as an inspection right to pay payment to the leaders of protected enterprises.
The United States Secretariat to Tesor, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republic of Representatives at the table of the treaty, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after half night, at the end of a deal of two days of a treaty martyr.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement", stated the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"All decisions were taken in a way to protect the economy and the American people from the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It's the crucial point: if we haven't acted in this way, inevitable deforts and turbages would be flown on the daily life of the Americans," stated the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the treaties was marked by concerns regarding the impact of a new failure on investors.
The limited time was corresponding to the opening of the markets, this morning.
After the Treaty, the two candidates to the American Presidency have shown themselves very favorable to the agreement, but not to avoid expressing their fault in front of the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is the subject to have added some provisions to the Agreement, in particular what will enable owners to maintain their home and inherently the rewards for the leaders of the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the inresponsiveness of others, there is nothing to rejoice.
But these measures are necessary," commented on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know whether he will vote for the plan, his republic adversary, John McCain, answered: "I want to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"When I read, it's something that we all have to divide and that will allow us to go forward."
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," said.
The 700 billion plan aims to recover the money of the contributors of suspicious credits, the risk-based and inconvenible assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan arrives after 14 months of crisis due to the disappearance of a real estate ball which first led to the slope of hypothetical risk credits (mutu) and then extends to other broader forms of credit titles (PCA) and to slow up liquidity and banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of delegates in charge to send the first project of a agreement last week to the air.
It seems to be out of that blind row since the democratics have accepted that the "toxic" active of certain difficulty companies will only be protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, at the Congress, a provision has been added to which, if the government had to face losses in the five years of arriving because of this programme, it could imply new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which more than 100 billion if the President is required.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
Instead of their aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected enterprises that will buy the dividents in case of profit and which will be able to come back when waters are calmed.
In accordance with the plan, the Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the pension procedures relating to real estate loans and to establish limits to payment and indentity paid to the leaders of the undertakings involved.
From today's plan architects would like to submit it to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate Mercedes.
Despite all the efforts, it is still not sure that you will be given free to their plan.
In fact, there were several votes against the project, both at the republic and democratic switch.
"Of course, Washington does not feel you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, members of the Camera Financial Committee, turned to his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But it is not sure to use those contributing.
Leader of a small group at the Congress on behalf of "the Skeets of Scientists", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Cartain of important economic teachers, including three Nobel Premies, have written us to say: We ask the Congress not to take any adverse conclusions and to consider the way to take care of it," said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was again a test of the world's nature of crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas knew that it would be rejected to the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty larger banks in Europe and ten larger insurers.
"It's not the money lost, he declared the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss yesterday.
Instead, the influence and vote rights are recovered in bank matters.
It's certainly something that the samplingers and the families appreciate now that the time is announced incertainly."
During this period, on the other side of the Manic, the British government seems to nationalize another financial crisis bank.
According to the English print, the government would be loaded from the whole of the current loans at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, which is more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has noticed yesterday that you will buy the succursales and customers of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undertake a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Engaged Icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was his axis in the manic, for others his weak point.
He was free of the Narcistic spectrum, the American actor from the smiling smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and the obviously talent would be removed from that circle of powerful ones dedicated to true and sacred monsters.
But what a conscious thing!
Paul Newman, the lost Thursday, at 83 years of age, in his ranch of the Connecticut, after a pulmonary cancer, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for the years.
Unlike Brando's monumental, which was similar and which was long a variety of revals on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he also carries the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples often born magic children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from the German Jewish father and the mother of Hungary origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious views of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last quality mark.
Because in him it was recognised a safe country that made man, from the Pacific war fighter, was fierce in the battle, which at the beginning of the 50s, studied dramatic art in Yale, and then often used the New York Studio Actor, before triumphing theater, in television and early in the film.
The same warrior man for civil rights was also the car pilot that classified according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with the artist Joanne Woodward.
If it goes with him the shadow zones of a reserved, discreet, engaged, allergic stars to the show-business scandals, which will never be able to swim the mystery.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of term.
This weekend, Paul Newman's disappearing was a shock in the heart for the films, while his great personalities populate the black screen of memorys.
Another half-year American cinema is reproposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy is incapable to want the focosa wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the kitchen that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember Mr. Bridge's sense of Mr. Bridge (1990), who was struck by a marriage that did not keep the promises.
So many other Paul Newman have passed to the story.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminally murdered, violent, intimable in Lassù, someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and recovered after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That wicked sympathy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
Love and sales player in Spain, a magnificent movie of Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which is the only oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, was his.
He's still.
The epochs happen through his path.
The young people know him especially for the film Slap Shot-Col sequencies of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team on a little ortodoed ice.
His fans found it in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Brothers Coen.
The circle was closed with the last role of the Icelandic mafia in Era, my father in 2003.
Unlike the most lyricest degrees of the movie that slowly abandoned the teacher, Newman will remain long in the salt, claiming Hollywood in its entire fashion, festivals and consents.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinemator, defined it, with a point of irone, "a challenge living at the superplaying", judged you exage his performances.
The professional wasn't always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, where the roles seemed to fall as a manner from heaven.
However, it often prefers the role of the young actor: nevrotic persons, alcoholized shooting or disappointed, which expressed slowly and rebellion with his perfect treats.
As register, Newman revealed unknown sfumation of his true, pushed sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, of 1968 (based on the Romans of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, led a smooth lacquery of the melonon.
He, who lost the son Scott for a overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and triste.
Among the innumerable shoes last night on Newman, his great friend and old arms friend Robert Redford (he had been renewed together in the Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said unfinishedly "Their presence took my life and this best country."
Generosity and life love, two great features of the disappeared actor.
Besides a lingery carriage, there is so a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent film, a Hollywoodian derivative.
We will have surprised his face shaking on oil bottles, salts, biscuits and other foods, judgeing it a bad choice, even though born as a game.
However, the income of these sales were intended to be the foundation for childhood in difficulties.
Newman, instead of adjusting himself to his mito, chose to join himself until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter he said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly recognising his good star.
It was a privilege."
And this was the privilege for us to follow the path of a so clean and generous American artist.
Citizens of the model, therefore, and much more.
What has been produced in the manufacture of Zuccio & partners?
In short, on 8 October, it will be discussed the hearing of the criminal proceedings against Yanos Zuppo and others.
Political man and its partners are accused of reiterated commercial fraud in the framework of a crime association that has caused significant damage, and other crimes, including false documentation.
According to the Search for the money obtained by concourse bands, they were used for private purposes, and have often certified the effectiveness of the activities through false fattures.
The State and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, has been finished in part in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the tasche of some people.
According to the method, which was known by the demanding authorities, they took the money obtained by competitive bands based on non-existent operations, and associations have never comply with the obligations undertaken.
According to the accused act, most of the facts were false.
In order to make it, the fabric blocks have been purchased at the market of Józsefvaros, and the circular tanks were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on the names of which you say to issue the fattures, it was established among the other during the guiza between the collines above the Balaton where Yanos Zuschlag had sent Isvan Lados.
According to the condemnation of this last, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
It has requested a commodity for consumption, on the model of these, the facts to be prepared, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Budapest Common.
Most of these are operating in Istvan Lados and András śri, which, according to our information, has, in particular, addressed the relationships required to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' study journey was a bird.
According to two factors issued by Zuppo and partners in 2003, the restaurant site has been able to be a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all come together.
Similarly, the faturation issued in the summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövśért Foundation, later called Egyuttt in Harmadik Evezredert, the shuttle of formal and content errors.
A pension of Badacsonytomas only has three rooms, but more than 10 people couldn't be able to break us evening, but there were 130 guests.
But the compilators of small fantasy factors were exagered when they marked the Pigal Kft., also this is a restaurant, in which accountability - according to the information issued to the judiciary authorities - did not contain the documents named Jobb Jövśért and Hopaá companies.
Gyśzś Farkas, company administrator, declared the hvg.hu that when it was called and showed the factures, he immediately understood that it was false documents.
"I fear the name and the Iva game of our company were in a wrong point."
He added: Besides the formal reasons, he did not even return the fact that, according to the factory, hundreds of people were accommodated, when in total there are nine rooms and there are no so many bedrooms.
The fatture was restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in function for time.
Factory compilators did not worried to inform themselves that the Budapest’s travel agency from their choice, organizing only travels to the outside, so shockly indicated on the facture with payment in travel accounts in Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of the company's employees.
Furthermore, as has been shown during the investigation, the fact that Iva was also presented, while the travel activities to countries outside the European Union are Iva.
Among otherwise, the amount of Iva was wrong with the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfullöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövśért Foundation, in fact on services offered by the company, Iva must apply to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the facts, as well as the hotel employees issued only printed factors, while the manufactured factory was written in hand.
In addition, the "employers" have destroyed other facts, in the case of this, as an activity carried out on road goods, such as it is known by the search procedure, activities that were not implemented by the company originally for investment consultation.
Moreover, for formal defects - because of non-compliant fatturation, false fear - has been found that the fattures emited for Egypt in Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, 21. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same occurred in the case of Ravenna Bt. or of the Sport Camp of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have issued the factures in question.
Falsificators did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyriregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) prayed a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, so that the curator of the liquidation of this, according to our information, refused to have issued him the facture.
They have employed fattures consecutively
Another group of fatting emittents is represented by those who were aware of the need to evacuate fixed fattures.
The Esèly Budapestért Alapítvay foundation has issued a facture on request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the employees, according to the accused act, convinced the Director of Collab Kft. to emit fattities.
He cooperated together with Zuppo and also with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided fattures for a value of approximately 5 million flowers from the Jobb Jövśért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörèsfenyś Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Even money moved because the prepared factuals were then stolen, but the associations forgot to make this appearance in their documents.
In the following group of these delegating factures, they belong to those who are linked to the employees.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the backup of the Director-General of Delta Trio Kft, with sites in Budapest but not equipped there, which cares for fuel and vehicle trade.
In October, November and December 2005 on the sale of informal means, the Commission granted a number of factors for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to the investigation data the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 has purchased these factures.
The Director-General of this statement was a Romania between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would enter into documentation on the detainee.
As we know Kubatov, during the investigation, has recognized that he has released facts in behalf of the company to the Atlasz, Hopaá and Egypt in Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvay, and the contra-value was brought by him.
His express request from Ivan Kubatov Roman wallers found the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, no one of the debts was effectively operative, because they had not received jobs according to the lawyer.
However, undertakings have become useful because, on request of the Countermember Z Solt Szente, the drafter of the foundation documents of the companies, on behalf of the debtors, have been granted facts to associations linked to Zuppo: at Atlasz and Y-Generacio.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has delivered 15 factories for a total of 14.2 million flowers.
The search believes that Kubatov has undertaken 10% of the amounts indicated on the factories, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to emit fixed fattures, manufactured for the concours band of Bytos Pont.
Y-Genérico and Sövetség to Modern Magyarországert in January 2006 presented a band for the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also win 500,000 flowers of head but the sums have not been used for the purposes indicated in the band.
As soon as this wasn't coming to gallery, they presented the TMA five fixed fattures received by Works Team Kft.
These factors have been found during the search for the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
A part of the employees, as they have already been looking for, will probably refer to the evolution of the production of the factories.
While the most interesting thing could be if the charged number one, Yanos Zuppo, would decide to spend the speed over all.
His condemnation has not been very detailed, and even though he has promised to speak more times in extent, he has not yet done it.
We should see whether it's in their interest, may also be that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - instead of reconstruction of 50 million flowers, most of the damage - would be willing to make the spontaneous capro.
Angriff for now could also be violated by the fact that his requests for safeguarding the conditions of his prison, namely the concession of home arrests, have not been found yet.
While the authors of unreasonable trade crimes and causers are very larger, they may be freely passed or at least waiting for the end of the procedure against them, which is not granted to him.
The psycology of pleasing in excess: Why do you sell more money?
The purchasers are intended to spend more and exceed the goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic basiss of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on the Scientific magazine, men don't want to stay back in an invitation such as eBay store, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "partite" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axis.
A volunteer group has played in the lote, the other group of players participated in a shop while with functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) have examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the stage game, where the substantial element is to join more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex involves intensely in function when they lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to the other functions, plays a role in the "the self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the veely reaction of the stretched body.
To support their theory, economicists of the research group have conducted a financial investigation of financial follow-up.
In this survey, three groups have participated against a partner in various conditions.
The monitoring group reported how much the real value of the product concerned was and they made their point.
Another group beyond this has promised that the winning case will receive another $15.
However, the third group would receive $15 before the stage, but the members of the group would lose the money if it was lost.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the profit has been highlighted, while the loss of the other has been lost.
By verifying neurological hypothesis, the members of the group who played "to the loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "winning".
"This results are not deducable by any of the previously existing economic theories.
Indeed, they explained the phenomenon to the axis with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the neurologic image creation methods have helped to solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of Economy.
Hepatitis: When do you go back to your doctor?
About half billion people in the world suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, instead of the first causes of death, chronic hepatic diseases are mentioned.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis over 100mills, of these are only healed by 7000: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are counted.
Hepatitis definition is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typicals are hepatitis and tyrity, but their pathogenic agents and caused diseases difference with each other.
Hepatitis viruses are distributed in two major forms according to the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e. g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic viruss (sperma, vaginal losses, saliva).
For whoever travels is useful to vaccine against virus A and B, against C does not exist vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A have two-third weeks after the consumption of infected food, accompanied by general disease, weakness, addominal pain and nausea.
After shaping skins on the skin and white of the eyes, the slightness becomes clear and the sweet urin, the guarigion occurs within two-third weeks.
A million people die every year throughout the world for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of disease, which causes leverage tumors and hepatic surgery.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person in ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
Even hepatitis C may have very serious consequences: if you are not treated, you can cause hepatic surgery and fegate tumors.
Most infections do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogen agents are destroying the hepatic cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important for the prevention and effectiveness of regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, the drug dependants and the tatuatos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is up to 200 million.
Because a routine laboratory also reveals the disease is the penalty to return to the family doctor when any symptoms of unknown origin is observed.
Recognised in time the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, so stops the infectious power and can be prevented by the training of tumors.
On September 30, it is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 in all the world for disease associations.
The purpose is to call attention to the viral chronic hepatitis, the cause of its development and early recognition of disease.
Who believes in God feels less painful?
According to the result of a recent survey, the religious faith works as a species of analysis that has become more sufferable to the death of the Catholic martyrs.
Scientists of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experience, considering how the faith in God influences the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
In the framework of the weird investigation, a electronicshock was performed at 12 Catholic believers and to such athi, while all of those observed a picture that represented the virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject a large part of pain.
Thanks to the investigative technique of human brain, Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, beyond the academics, also participate in scientists, philosophys and theology of the university.
The test has been exactly carried out in this way: a tool that emits loads and passes the electroshock has been linked to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary pictured in the XVII century by Sassoferrato and the Dama with the hermily of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the XV century.
The authors of the review hoped that the image of the Gentile Maria originated a kind of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's framework was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought that it was a tranquilization effect.
Experience subjects passed half an hour before the MRI scanner, and in this age of time they received 20 electronicshock in four consecutive series, while observing or drawing about religious or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made you feel "secure", as if "no one cares" of them and "see are calmed and were persistent from peace".
As we looked at the image on religious subjects, 12% were less painful than when they were before Leonardo's work.
The psychologue Miguel Farias, who took part in the test, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effects also for the athies, but it is necessary to find the proper image.
"We need to search for a image to which they eat very positive feelings, such as a mother or father," said the psychologue.
The English bishop Tom Wright has enjoyed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases you can change our personality." - He added Wright.
After the best results, the question is only if the believers are presented the painting of a madam of Leonardo or another painting of such calibra, which could have effect on the control of pain?
The vision of a virgin Maria of quality would bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the 10th complex, Google can say to find himself in the tastes of people as well as in the heavens above their tests; you know where they passed the holidays, where the ambulance is common and what it interests.
However, this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of this, is not enough yet.
What is instead of the scettics that make a comparison with the orwellian incube, they do not really see the substance of the website 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt declared to the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google is to collect more personal data from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google founders that was: "We're in a system all the information of the world!".
According to the Google Director interviewed this, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of ability to manage all information.
The question what will happen for five years Schmidt answer: would he like if Google would answer questions like "What am I tomorrow?" or "What would be the suitable job for me?", but softwares do not know to answer questions apparently simple because they don't know enough users.
Not all internates are aware that during their Internet searches are registered exactly the searching words, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested persons are stopped after the search.
By the Personalized Search started two years ago, users, e.g., can memorize their navigation history, they can relate to what they searched and clicked, then these long walking will generate results in a very better measure; on this logic it is based on recommendations that the system offers us products and services based on our previous and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they look at what I'm doing? - They are asked for the worried users of Google data monopolie.
In most of the cases, antirelations of internal persons are caused by the fear tested for the size of the potential power represented by this, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or for the rebellion to power.
However, a fact is confirmed, and it is that all the claims are not only registered but may also be provided to third parties in such cases, in these legal cases, nothing defends the personal rights of internal persons.
The most clear example of this in recent times was probably the action coordinated against Brazil's pedofils, in which Google has introduced the Brazilian government the information that has made possible the identification of pedofils from the page of the Orctus community maintained by Google.
However, the people concerned on personal rights have suspicious assignment by May when this - in agreement with the Association of EFF electronic legal protection - have successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later, Google can not be found with any point of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(All the same time, the federal government has successfully struck nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousand research expressions received in relation to the confirmation of the children's protection law approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and key words for two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore extremely contradicting: those who are afraid to provide their personal data are exercising Google because they believe that their neighbouring area and the private life starting to use them and seeks with the rebellion of multinationals that strike for the conservatory image.
Among the time, the geek American culture and the proliferator of appassionates, attivists and computer users compared in many countries see in them the future generation of great debts, the "Cool corporation" against their rival, the Microsoft liquided as a world conqueror because of Windows, as both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask his users an identity code, does not demand money for their own services, the source that has always been updated, and the program package is much more accessible, younger and cool from the official practice of the software collection.
But it may also happen because geeks see exactly the problem between personal rights and the Internet, which involves just one of the key words that are more often repeated in the past few years, the web 2.0.
The website 2.0 is not only about cooperation, to leave intentionally traces behind us and to use communication channels to our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual is the same: show us yourself.
A young media can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect you with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that elections your musical guests, all of them can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write blogs on which its most recent photo galleries are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
So we read many examples of the cases clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos cut on the morning from the common round of friends, comes easy to know with those who pass his perfect boy or one of them can leave his employee because he wrote a sincere view on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live in online lives make a way to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental teas that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Instead, who wants to hide something or only wants to avoid the Google monopolie can do this (e.g. starting with Google search system but that at the same time does not leave voluntary tracks).
There are no few people who do not register about community pages for not found, the online Google applications, the development of texts for image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions not read with large server parks and that do not compose our best profile until existing.
The public opinion is even waiting even in secret at the moment when Google will get out of the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the AdWords/AdSense public spaces threaten the entry of public agencys, recording services caused not only the Microsoft but also many software developments.
However, the critical observers about all this find an alarming point: the company's headquarters, for example, rejected the protest of employees after the reducing duplication of the company asylum, considered too costly the resurrection to enjoy daily employees, but all this decreased in the fact that in 2006, Google the chief to the Chinese government and in the sense of their agreement, will filter all the results that open the good profit and interests of the Chinese regime.
A internal rule of this seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be useful, one thing is sure, that the predictable problems of the next months and years of the world will be distressed at a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archive of books and records of Google will take proportions such as that this will soon be faced by the Supreme American Court, others have fear of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our references, medical and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fansic writers, the story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, where a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors have helped the double occupied of Ozd to destroy the tracks
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ozd, suspected with reasons that he helped to shoot the traces of the crime. He declared on March the portion of the Police Chesture of the Borsod region.
Young people have recognized the crime to their infringement, and now they are accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the ITT, are freely defended.
The favorite is punishable until 5 years of reclusion.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was put in preventive detention.
He's suspected of pre-meased pluriomide for lunch.
The investigation resulted that the young twenty-five had a great debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to spend the debt, so the last mercoled reason he took his creditor with an injury in a snake of Ozd where he and the 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was ready to do the crime, a signal is the fact that murdered with a hidden weapons on the place.
The police's investigating the weapon and the circumstances of the use of a expert.
The Borsa of Varsavia offered for the purchase of the Borsa di Praga
The Varsavia's values have offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech Koreans, for the purchase of 100% of the shareholder of the Prague's values.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Borsa of Varsavia, confirmed the advanced offer from Polands, despite the ceches had been excluded in previously the Varsavia's Borsa as possible as buyer of the Borsa of Praga.
The reason for exclusion is that the Borsa of Varsavia is of the property of the state.
99% of the actions are in hand to the Poland state that is intended to sell over a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the offering of Polands represents the highest number up to date for the Prague Border.
According to the Czech print now have presented a offer for the Vienna Borsa, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Borsa, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Borsa and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of the Borsa Values of Prague, declared last week that among all interested persons the Borsa of Varsavia would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could bring to the end of the Prague's Borsa.
Market experts estimate the value of the Borsa of Prague in 5-10 billion coronary.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the shareholders would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa di Praga is the Patricia Finance with a quota of almost 25%, followed by the Bank śeská Spośitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. at 13.5%
Economic crisis from European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Monday's comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the President of the United States - accused of the Republic - who has not been able to comply with his party behind a rapidly abuse law, which is the purpose of relief to a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the super-financiar Warren Buffett, would be more exactly talking about a second September.
Also, a part of the print of Madrid is seeing the spontaneous capro in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political guidance has dropped the world economy on the shopping oil.
It grows increasingly the danger of the United States financial system, and it will suffer all over the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect but due to the vote of the Congress there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
World economy is suspended in air, just when the most transformation of capitalism history is happening.
It is no longer possible to overlook the threat - raise the Days-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer savings to the shipping financial institutions and with the money of the contributors can save them from the failure.
But if more banks grow as in a Sunday effect then they will not be sufficient, nor the financial means or new immediate solutions.
The Member States of the European Union must overcome their national self-economic and focus on the control of discharged financial markets.
On the other hand, the undebolted financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - remembering the Vienna Der Standard, as they seem to be more realized than the European contributioners, like the Americans, will have to put their hands on their portable to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" should not immediately decline the 100 billion euros, however, it would be better if they set up in the case of the contributing money should be touched to prevent larger damage.
Intelligent machine imitate the flight of the calabron
What could be the best method to develop anti-collection technologies if you do not imitate the hinders sensors that are in nature?
For example, the fires.
In the surprising project presented to the CETEC in Japan, the calabronians gave the initial strategic exhibition to the engineers Nissan how to build the next generation of anti-collization systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokio, the Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a provisioned robotized car for fire property, with the final aim of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Fire flights form a personal oval space that really seems to our protective school - he explained the Kazuhiro Doi exposure, director of the technological sector PR and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the ape, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in every direction.
The engineers acted with the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the view.
The BR23C indicates the obstacles to two meters of distance within a ray of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of board that will immediately transform it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second to the robot, the obstacle is understanding, and then, imitating the movements of the ape, it changes the direction immediately by turning the routes of the necessary measure to avoid the incident.
This evacuation manual, in a different way from the current system, is performed in a way of all institutionality.
"If the robot wasn't so, he could not react fast to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Labor and Roboter project.
It should be instant and immediately reacting because this technology corresponds to the harmful and internal street of the protective school, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
All the process must reflect what it makes to avoid other fires.
This process must be performed in an eye battery.
But in contrast to fires, the duration cannot go to the height or low or in diagonal, it may be only bidimensional and in the direction of stressability of the route.
Instead, instead of the unfinished possibilities to discharge other fires, the robot, as a disposal possibility, may switch on himself, accelerate and rail.
BR23C is feeded by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and higher energy density, which means that their duration is higher than the lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important that intelligence of the intelligent reaction, not the development of data or even less the ability to imagine them.
This robot must develop some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to remember and react with intuitive logical based on previous manual data, so only use a few Kb's memory.
There is no need for a gigabyte memory or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate evasion of collisions that, predicting Nissan, within 10 years, can be installed on series vehicles.
Additional application opportunities can be represented by the unification of GPS satellite navigation systems that avoid the barriers present on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name to the child very costly
The written version of the Economic Reservation Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in more parts.
In the first pass, the half of the sum is spent.
In the new end-protracted agreements until mid-day night according to the East Coast's time of the Congress leaders have decided to rescue plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that was long-day - reported the Reuters.
We have made progress - Nancy Pelosi, President of the Chamber of American Representatives, said that it was only to put the letter agreement.
Both the candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, have supported the plan's compromise.
The Minister of Teacher Henry Paulson, talking about the result of the compromise, stated: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not the saving of Wall Street but the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was public prior to the opening of Asian markets at 8 hours at Washington (the 2nd Monday night after the Central Europe) but has not produced a great growth in the burden.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will first vote the defined 2008 economic stabilisation law on the programme, after he will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke Saturday night with the Pelosi, then welcomed the news of the Agreement with joy to the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to establish our financial markets and to defend the economy - said Tony Fratto português of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of Bush administration, which prescribed that the $700 billion would be all expenditure for the purchase of holdings with disproportionate credits on the floors.
Now as the first step will be possible to expend the half of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday of the Congress, with these, the Minister of Teacher will purchase accounts with disproportionate credits, the sort of the remaining $100 billion will decide the President.
A special college will control the programme to which also participates the President of the Federal Reserve.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In the sense of the Law, the Ministry of Teacher can apply a combinated tactic: it can purchase credit, hypothetics and titles with hypothetics and other types of credit "upplied".
The purchase can happen through a steady and directly - have announced the competent ministers.
The legal standard makes it possible for those concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Technology guarantees the means that cause concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price to the possible damages.
Henrz Paulson said that the law gives the necessary means so that 700 billion dollars come to the urgent requirements of the American monetary system, which are the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of a large financial institution.
We will make all the steps necessary to find us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and at waiting for State aid think that the government will limit their goodness, defined by the slang of other oceans, simply as gold paracades.
The limits of payment will only be in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Technology will provide aid.
In fact, the limitation means that if the minister will purchase in the framework of a steel, it will set up an overwhelming on the gold parachute if they do not send the decay bank director in pension.
At the time of the direct acquisition of disproportionate credits, the government will be aggressively interrupted in order to ensure that the money of the directors is not exhausted.
This will add that the already existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new to encourage the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of legal limitation on the payment of general administrations - commented on the measures of the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the Chamber of Representatives.
In addition to this, it has the right to approve a quota of the banks participating in the programme, reduceing the risk of the contributing banks, since they can also win us if the economy, together with the saved bank, will turn back.
The law proposal includes that in the next five years the President must submit to the Congress a proposal that provides for the refund to the contributors the losses resulting from the financial sector.
Of course, both parties have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us, not to defend the dollars of the contributors, - he declared the Republicn Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic partner of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same ones that are responsible for the Wall Street's crown.

The next year in the United States without seeing?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January may enter into force the American and Hungary Unified Agreement of Visual Exemption - the Minister of Foreign Affairs talked about this in Chicago with the Hungary representatives of the place.
According to its opinion, "hour all depends on the fact but other oceans are built in time the electronic input and control system."

He will meet the Minister of Foreign Condoleeza Rice, whose medal of the Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary with the Stella, and will engage with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also been skilled in favour of the bank salvation plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates to the Presidency of the two major American parties, have guaranteed their support on Sunday at the government plan of $700 billion for the saving of banks, but there are politicians who claim the demissions of the Minister of Tesor.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration after the long-day marine treaties, Sunday night, have announced that a principle agreement on the saving plan of banks has been concluded.
The crisis of Wall Street and the financial package for frozen credit markets have become the central issue of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to make the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the recent surveys with the first plan of the economic issues of Obama, the benefit of McCain, obtained after the Republicn convention with the appointment to Vice-President of Sarah Palin, was dispersed.
Obama in a conversation in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress quickly approve the law on the plan of 700 billion dollars.
He emphasized that the proposal contains the protection passements of consumers that have also been supported by him.
"We must act responsiblely (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the full economic stability" - said in front of a population of 35,000 people.
It has not been left to define the economic ideas of McCain.
McCain in an interview to the ABC explained that "all the things we'll send down with difficulty this situation (...) but it's not doing anything is not a pathway."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal contained the establishment of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outcomes of the top manager, which was to insist.
Obama said to CBS that McCain did not have a role in the agreements, but he was in contact with the Minister daily.
President Nancy Pelosi reported that the Chamber of Representatives probably will vote the law proposal for a month.
Printing reason of the world of German language
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious car - so The Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Baviera.
The Haider party is ready to rule Austria to prevent red coalition.
The scene (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine, in the article Baviera's revolution divorces his parents, analyzes the causes of the disconfied CSU dramatics.
According to the polytolog, the CSU's erosion has been started very much before Beckstein-Huber's tragic couple entered.
The Christians have remoded the Baviera for decades and now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of the time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The disconfied was not a great surprise for the CSU, but the Sunday ended a process that was precisely ten years ago to be achieved: the uncertain Yugoslavia of a state party has ended.
Yes, 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was 47.7 per cent, for the first time under the sleeve of 50 per cent for the years 50.
This has been repeated three years ago in the Federal Tag elections in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is because of modernization in the region, which divorces parents.
Sociologists have pronounced it 40 years ago, but have been very wrong in time. However, the secularization, the results of education, the establishment of the Eastern and Northern Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without a consequence of the fidelity of elections in the CSU.
Modernization is equal to the increased opportunities and it is obvious to the political consequences.
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious, critical, ostinates.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks the CSU has taken out of the classic Bourgese groups: the vocational freedoms, the arts, the diplomas and the wheels.
This is the support of the CSU under 40%.
Press (depresse.com)
The Vienna conservator "Who with who?" in the article "The Presidents of the party are blocked in coalition issues" is concerned about the confusion of Austrian internal political situation created after elections.
The SPUE intends to treat the EVP.
The EVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZUE is open to treaty in all directions, and the green do not still want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now rounds all around the coalition; in the discussion transmitted from the public television, the leaders of the party just saw the cards.
Warner Faymann President of the SPUE confirmed to want to treat the EVP.
The SPUE wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann opened the question if it can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current President of the EBP, as a vice-century.
As you stated, the course of Schüssel-Molterer has been in any case refusal.
Repeating this direction is not considered.
Molterer was carefully reacted to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not have been successful if Faymann tries to enter into the internal business of the EBP.
If your party chooses the opposition or income in the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the matters should be discussed in any case within the EBP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÃO has repeated that it was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red coalition, we are ready to take our responsibility to rule", said Haider.
Yaroka: I need to cut the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Party Opportunities, organized this year from France to the European Union's presidency.
Livia Yauroka, Mr Fidesz of the European People's Party, in the message addressed to the plenal as a principal rapporteur of the Congress, has called on the attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation of Roman children and the most serious obstacle to their statement.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
Among the invitations to the conference, governments, European social partners and representatives of the larger civilian organizations and the protection of rights within the same opportunities.
The European Parliament's press office of the Fidesz PE Group has remembered, in addition to discrimination in the affairs, that the Romans are cut off from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"The majority of the young Romans have no media study title and, as a result of the elementary education of bad quality, only a unreasonable number of them can reach a higher study title."
Jaroka also stressed, as fundamental human rights, the key role of education in making human rights valuation.
Investment in the education of Roman children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Deputy, there is a need to be aware of these links in the most wide range between the Romans and the non-Roms.
As soon as the school begins, it is more likely to become a productive member of the labour market; through payment rates for income and consumers contribute to the budget of the country.
"The right to European Roman citizenship must ensure their right to quality education and the elimination of the schools of low-level and secret", said Livia Yaroka.
The Deputy believes that the European Union's objective and action unit is necessary to accelerate school deregulation processes and therefore is essentially the right respect for existing and designed anti-discriminatory directives.
"The vicinity circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, the need to give the Roman children the opportunities granted by the democratic space so they can contribute as citizens to the future of Europe", asked Japan.
In the sign of the "European Year of Party Opportunities" to ensure for everyone, the goal of the European Summit for Party Opportunities organized every year, from Berlin's meeting last year, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the State and European level.
CSU: pleasing for a transitional period
At the end of October, it will decide the sort of the imprisoned couple Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the bad electoral disagreement, the tests have not yet fallen, but the Bavarian CSU's headquarters had been sent to the debate on personal issues at the time.
The Chairman of the Erwin Huber party and the regional Governor, Ohther Beckstein, remain on their own place, the question is until the time the mercy ends.
From the outcome of the tandem that has already lost a disaster of 17% will decide the extraordinary gap of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two extremely critical politicians have known in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces in the country.
They have so tried to smile the angry scribes of the parliamentary group and the basis that a day after the "bavarous tsunami" have prepared the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber then at the culmination of his carriage, the Christian and Social Union receives 60.7%, but now after the assault of state against Stoiber 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "solute monarch" in Baviera that gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservators in the Southern region are always essential for the Hungary economy, but they will be in the future to coal with themselves.
Whatever the first signal of the reorganization within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agricultural Horst Seehofer, which is considered possible heritage of Huber, has obtained a place in the restricted investigative group that will start treating with the FDP liberals and the Liberian Electors who represent the right values for an eventual government coalition in Monaco di Baviera.
For a strange cry of the destination in the list of Liberian Electors, the Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to shoot by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treat the woman without regarding the great ambitions.
The CSU leaders are now focusing on all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
The former regional and former president of the CSU will also have an active role, also Stoiber, which has been in the shadow. On September 28, the most loved day of his political career.
Lunedì Huber gave some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, according to which they would be more supported by the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the challenge as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
The Merkel cannot be cancelled after the Federal Tag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU that has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory will not be recovered.
According to the Merkel, who does not hide the delusion for the fascination, the loss of the CSU will not be negatively affected by the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the fertility of the CSU, but the crisis of social democratic crisis is still hard.
The SPD has reached its lowest result since 1946 in Baviera at 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition has entered in Bielorrush Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead explained with the brochures made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 million people from a country of ten million people is free of opposition for over one decade, before the elections of last, the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped that Lukashenko was seriously renewed for the fourth time after the constitutional amendment to the elections of 2006, "conceived" a number of seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS thus rejected a previously evaluated boicottage.
After the opposition's expectations were that Belarus, which was always more economicly depending on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas, which has agreed to give Russian gases in possession of Belarus through the country, was intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-border political policies cannot enter into the Belarus's anti-democratic situation.
It was referring to a detention that the OSCE, evaluating the election campaign, had focused on positive and not the lack of movements, such as the prohibition to present themselves for a third of the candidates of opposition.
However, the rapid Monday report of the OSCE also criticized the campaign, during which the candidates of the practical opposition could not appear on the print, and in particular that the opposition was not able to be present at the content of the votes.
Despite this opposition, a better improvement in the political climate is apparent: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk has also been prepared to a small comparison with Moscow and continued to reject the recognition of the Southern Ocean and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms on the letter a federal state, which is considered independent to the two countries for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - has stated to our journal Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the Presidential candidate to the opposition of the 2006 elections, it is hoped that it remains unlikely that "the might have been afraid to make one opposer in a no weightless Parliament."
The opposition does not provide protests for results, but try to bring the elections the message to the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, we need to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities have difficulties for distribution, but I also see that more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially helped goal, the pensions, considers appropriate the Lukashenko regime that considers the main result of the creation of social security.
Because of the debit of the country and the increased economic deficit, it is only a question of time the disaggregation of social security "he remembers the secular silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Instead of opposition policy, Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebetev President of the Community Independent States has declared to the Russian Press Agency RIA Novosti: "Mans believe not in words but in fact", so the lack of opposition is not other than the evidence of maturity of Bielorrusian electors.
Brunetta: "First breakfast before work"
There was no success in Palazzo Chigi's history that there were rounding doors for the entry and out of the employees.
But from today takes this new measure against the furbs, against those who fear and then will drink a coffee to the bar in worktime.
The anti-children news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rounding doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the Minister needs.
"A new stage of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is reformism," still stressed Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Council's presidency.
For Masi "the selection of the rotating doors is also important from the symbolic view".
There was no resistance from employees, assured the Secretary-General: "It was a process shared by the employees and there has been cooperation with all."
Instead, nothing more breakfast in worktime; nothing more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "A beautiful cappuccining is a holy hand."
During a meeting at the High School of Public Health
in Rome, the Minister then notes that "in three months the disability for public employees has reduced 50%, i.e. 600,000 people in more than one year".
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Publication more effective
Italian, "the wage dynamics - the Minister explains - in the past 8-10 years have been double in respect of the private and well above the inflation rates".
Thousands of public employees have joined to respond to the rules of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the recovery supported by the Codacons.
"In the Minister of Public Function today, there would be numbers of about the smallest occupationality because of disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'children operating' is continuously growing.
Thousands in Italy are in fact the employees of the correct and productive public administration that have been united to declare war with the illicit standards contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be responded to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for nursing depending on the cause of service; the extension of the time facility facility of the sick worker, where control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 incidents, 3 people died and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths have been around 1.200.
Numbers that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deceptions than killings.
To call on the attention of institutions, social forces and information about this dramatic question, today the Anmil celebrates all the 58th National Day for the victims of work in the second Sunday of October.
"The worried data distributed by the Anmil and the same chronic tragics of these days confirm as critical as the question of the prevention of work," says the President of the Republic of Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, Mutilated and Invalid National Association, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its "life appreciation for the continuing associative commitment to prevention in places of work, protection of unfortunate workers, assistance of victim families and awareness of public opinion".
"It has, of course, led to a 'bast', sincerely divided, in front of tragedy that, for their dimension, sustains the clauses of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality provides us drametic cases, even repeating in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "is certainly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the many initiatives in school for a more direct conscience by young people who are at work world.
It is important to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to the alarm of its social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
From his song, the President of the Camera Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of white dead forms a absolute social emergency, which opens the conscience of each of us and imposes all institutions a decision-making commitment to bring you urgently end".
"The data on the labour seem to mark a slight path, but this doesn't remove that the number of white dead are still impressed", noted the President of Amil Peter Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "tendence to the residue" to be translated in less attention, because it's just when the attention goes up that exploses the tragedy.
"We believe that, at the general level, it is still too little to contrast the phenomenon of distress and the contrast can be exercised through multiplectional actions.
It is necessary, at our judgment - he highlighted Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"Serve a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and sensibilisation of public opinion.
But, above all, there is a greater sense of responsibilities by employees against a phenomenon which represents social emergency."
Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the indentary protection levels for the victims of the work" and the "assistant assistance to which the system is broken over the past years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the employee the insurance guarantee - he added - because the kind of persons who are unfortunate should not depend on spontaneism or eligition once prepared by the legislator."
MP3 readers as accused, risk the hearing
Listen to high volume music for a long time of time using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing lessons.
It is reported by the European Commission, which in a communication published in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emergency and Recent Health Risk (Csserri) of the Ue, published today.
"Despite this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices per week for more than one hour per day, holding high volume devices risk a permanent loss of audio capacity."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people that use frequently portable musical devices and telephones at high accused levels can inconsistently harm their listening unreparablely," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Do scientists - continue the responsible Ue - emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
Moreover, we need to acknowledge consumers and make these information on public domain.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and to keep steps with the new technology."
Brussels had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the great use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the laugh from them.
"Let Scientists - conclude the executive Ue - confirm that there is a reason for concern, and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the parties concerned whose measures could be taken in order to better protect children and adolescents from the exhibition of the motive from portable musical equipment and firm equipment."
Today, there is already a European security standard which limits the level of the portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but they are concerned about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to these sources of mood.
These damages can be limited by means of solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of bloom exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee you presents that the portable music equipment users if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for sun 5 hours per week exceed the current limits in force regarding the maximum permitted on workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for more long periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a 5-year period.
This would be 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Ue.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the future of capital
Today it begins, in March, to be closed, the sums will be shooted in June.
This is the calendar set by the Championship for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which has been placed this morning in his new seat behind the Charcalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will put the guidelines for Rome.
Once closing the battlers in March, the Board and the Joint Council will evaluate analysis and projects, so that the Strategic Plan for Rome will be able to submit in June with the "Official Balline" of the Campoglio and its German Union.
"The Commission is absolutely independent, and all the political, social and cultural ideas have been represented - it has to emphasize German - must provide proposals for a Rome development idea that the political decision-makers, which remain the Council and the Joint Council, will then be able.
There is no supervision of roles but only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its work will end and then be discovered, because this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June, we will present the strategic plan by using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
The Commission of Inutility, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany replies: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission, and as I am also sure in Rome, it will be essential.
Too often, the policy is on the management of daily and on emergences that are at times maintained.
We, on the contrary, want to see more long and more far, in a deepest perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Church of Rome has to point out that "This Commission is not an unnecessary entity, nor a vehicle: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to raise and engage in the best intelligence of the capital."
For Germany, in fact, "It is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a real level salt, which has absolutely needed, thinking with an unilateral spirit to its future."
A future that, in the area of Rome, "not will be limited to the only current common limits but will look well further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "as well as in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that has to pass to us independence: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, declined the United States economy and had reports (comme it is also today by citizen private) with the Islamic enemy."
They increase the attacks against Obama just while the date of the elections is near.
She wrote a lady of Miami on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face: believes he will win the highest load of a nation that has had in all two rulers and five black senators!".
They are in fact attacks that do not say so much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not respond to the question of the elections: is it a good President? Epo are the polls; they say all that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there's someone talking with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper of Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the chain to vote, we know who will vote the American patriot.
It's out of a side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
"That you want, then we'll think we're going to put the cross, if on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll go away from America.
This has never been done before now, which seems almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapons for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: how were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 500,000 soldiers and sent home to calci.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to do valge.
However, Irak for most was the weak point of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
Using, the economic trail is also feeling about journalists: in the newspapers it is time to break it. And many do the Internet's fault, "assault" of the printed paper.
Fifty hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their professional and mental control for the future.
However, today the journalists are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, newsletters have not openly declared feeling less worried about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Moreover, the keys made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a great problem.
It is a problem that will be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you don't want the traditional journalism as it is intended to pursue substantially.
A clear but comprehensive pessism is today the American journalist.
You are on ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that the newspaper at national level follows a wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Stamped against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest houses open a shock towards the Internet, for many views as the "assault" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists warned has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they break the technology in hope that "do something good" for their journalism.
The largest disappearing today in the American journalism is among those who are heading newsrooms - that is, directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of the executives at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage increases to 23%.
For some, this has to be done with the "security of the work".
Executives that think of losing jobs around 3 years are at a national level at 47%.
For staff reporters, you go to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (in our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation, such as the Uses, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet workers often offer what they want and become so a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large payments, while the editor can also win $10,000 per month, beyond the pension and payment of insurance.
For the holidays, then, the rating is complicated: to days after the first year, to the third to reach 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their appointment, often "ammal" for the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, COPPOLA RESTATE A GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the essence of the immobilist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrada, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking investigation in the context of the Unitedpol-Bnl counter-scale investigation.
During the process to his load, the last week, he obtained the lack of the householders transformed into residence obligations in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the immobilist to walk the tragic from the city of province to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (which has given the opinion against the pm) would allow him to influence his society and access to the evidence they accused of it.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon was already shown a few days ago with the vote of the Chamber of Representatives against the saving plan of 700 billion dollars stored by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the economy.
There is a confirm of the New York Times last night by informing that the current crisis is shocking the Republican Party, always more divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and community business institutions, and its new soul, instead, conservators, opposites to those of Washington and the world of financing, especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, for the appointment, has been prepopulously alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is just a example of changes, major changes, that the current economic earth may be predicting or already leaveing: not only in the United States but also in the whole of the West and may not be just here.
Even in the Uses and in Europe, the crisis seems to be functioning as a accelerator of phenomenon incubation for time that in the new climate they are consolidated and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renovation, the extraordinary relance, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a species of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank-financing institutions who have, indeed, associated with the external, but first of all are seeing the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This creates immediately a political problem for those who rule it: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and the families that, among others, are also a electory.
Instead, the crisis appears economically, but politically is almost nationally.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the game or does not have much to say: the lighting test is given by the European Union, which is commonly divided between the various interests and between the various state strategies, is not able to decide any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each single state that is expected to intervene, saving and reliance plans, new rules, and in particular from funds: since the time to reaching the closes are only states that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to restore matters in the sixth.
They also have the necessary means and legitimation to be used: two resources of incompatible value, in certain circumstances, which are likely no market and no international organization will never be available in similar ways.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the statistical and national element is the rest in perfect symptoms with the increasing importance of the most recent developments in the economy tend to affect a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Indeed, while we were convinced that we were now in the Kingdom of the network, the always more sophisticated technology, the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have understood a treat that our future will, instead, make accounts in a growing measure of accounts with those very little inmaterial things that are water, collapses, oil.
All things that, look at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the land, but they are read absolutely to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Because those who are here to be sovereign, they certainly have many cards more than those who are not, to those who have the difficulty to live in a place without assemblies, without oil and water.
I'm coming to the second news that I take a fractures.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitablely says Political, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the consciousness of the object requires authorised leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a decrease of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species, is so inadequate and small shadow areas.
And together something more deeply and certainly worried: a discredit, an insufficient, a image of inadequacy, a sense of lontanity, which tends to engage the whole leader class in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be more widespread, in the largest sector of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of social elites, their way to hear and to be, their culture in the comprehensive adoption of the term, to have done their own time and to be more extraordinary to the views of the majority.
The request of leadership, instead, is substantially a ratified but potential movement of delegation of the traditional leaders and political assets, which is expressed in the imminent "revolted" elections or in the suddenly executions of the colleagues of these last and last times, from the conservatory access to the Labour Consenses in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congress against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the straight in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rides, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it always more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not currently sharing in the streets of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases, affects potentially dismissing.
Before all of this, it would be frankly exagerated about a "rebellion of mass" at the order of the day.
But keep your eyes open of course isn't for nothing.
The superball to walk on the walls
Set gravity laws thanks to a super ball and in the future walking on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and a team of four institutions has now been very close to us.
With a single adequacy of 2,5 squarecm, the studios have been able to keep a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American Science magazine published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the studios team is an evolution of those existing who use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubs.
“The principle of the colla can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a pile of spaghetti” explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the skins of the gyms, covered by microscopic games that can ensure the perfect leadership of the animal.
The tests conducted on various materials such as vitro, Teflon and vitrate paper, have demonstrated that the new addesive is 10 times more powerful than the channels of these rectangles and at the same time's escapes are easy from the wall," Liming Day, researcher of the Engineering university of Dayton.
CAMMINARE MURI? -"This material may be useful as transitory additive," adds Liming Day.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a very less attractive use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications could be related to airspace engineering.
For the moment, I'm not going to be over.
ALTRA RICERCA – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search of a new adequacy.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, California students presented a suitable microfibre format such as hair that pull from powders during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit sugar
Attention to the pompelm succumb, the ring and the skin.
These drinks, especially consumption in states because of the declaring and rich vitamins, if you at the same time take some saved medicines, it changes the absorption by simplifying or decrease the effectiveness in the cases as well as seriously for health.
The risks of fruit sugar and freshly associated with the absorption of certain medicines David Bailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which from the 236th National Chemical Society in Philadelphia at the 236th meeting launches a new alarm: a little bit of pomps, rams and roof to reduce the absorption of some saved medicines, cancel the benefits and risks of patients' health.
The pompelm succo was already under accused accusedly because it was considered responsible to increase until the toxic levels of the effects of some antiarthmic, antibiotic, ansiolotic, antistaminatic and neurologic drugs.
Farmaci A RISCHIO - The same Italian Agence of the Pharmacist had been newsed in an information bottle two years ago by driving doctors and patients to not underestimate the risk resulting from this mix and to take care of what you drink in the case where you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NON SOLO POMPELMO - According to experts, the sugar of glucose and skin contains substances that prevent medicines.
The list of active principles that are prohibited by the pomp and the other sugars.
From here, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology Department of the State University of Milano: "They generally discovered are immediately marked to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that eventually intend to change the information notes of the medicines.
So always read the illustrative letters of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impress, but ask the doctor or pharmacist's statements," emphasized the expert at the Ansa Agency.
The Economy Nobel in Paul Krugman
The Nobel premium for the economy was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches to the University of Princeton and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical ones of the choices in economic and external policies of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, Krugman had planned in an editorial issue published on New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that was not a few Polympics and that for years has been reflected to economicism, but that has now been cleared.
"I'm surprised and also a bit shocked for the speed with which the memories of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom collapses are lost from the attention of the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a 'economist of great value', but also a distributor with a very agressive style, particularly critical against the excess of freedom of Bush administration.'
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 delivery, the open source of personal productivity that aims to achieve more users from the office home, professionals to the public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by voluntary developers, at which the new Open Office is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: the welcome screen and the review interface is less expensive, if they add other substantial compatibility for the Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also to the interoperability with the Suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doch, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that allows to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, such as e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, storing the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphic of Adobe with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text manufacturer.
Cooperation is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculator sheet, you can use more hands between different users, avoiding the conflicts on the changes, the text developer, each collaborator is given a color in comments for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some functionalities of OpenOffice on the web ( on the cloud, on the cloud), and the next weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version is downloaded to the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English that was found on the lunch views.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
Your request may also be sent home or at workplace the cd of installation.
And if the theme of free will be a train for dissemination in houses, it's just in business that Open Office succeeds the big school, already counting on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And they don't miss the realities offering an ideal training, advice and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the respective Word video writer; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emblem presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access program is the program that can work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considers that we are almost 3 million and 600 miles now, with the output of the new version, it is likely that we can also exceed the expected number.
Also positive coal result is the fourth case of doping
A new case of position at the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, classified third and winner of the best scalator magic.
Reporting the news is the website of the daily La Team.
The 26th century Kohl is the fourth positive runner in the Cera, the third generation epoch, after the Italian Riccardo Ricô and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, even those of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis on the blood samples of Kohl includes those carried out in the last weeks by the Laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If controversial analysis will confirm the positiveness in Cera, Austria will lose the third place at the Tour and meet the two years of canonic squalification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positiveness at the Epo of the third generation is the chief of the French antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who has informed the Associated Press Association that he has notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th Austrian podium was on the end of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, accompanied the magia for the best scalator.
IMIGRATY: NEW YORK TIMES WHAT CHIEDE, ITALIA is RAZZISTA?
Italy, "the countries of immigrant countries have only become a privileged destination for immigrants" acknowledged with refusal.
This is turning Belpaese into a country of racists? How much is it asked in a long article the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, joining the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating Burkina Faso killed in Milan last month for stealing a sketch of biscots.
This case indicates what it now defines the "south paradox": the northern regions are at the same time the "more integration and more work", but also the "more anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the highest support in the North League".
By confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, now also quoted the episodes of intolerance of Milano, Parma, Rome, Cimpino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation referred to by the Law that strikes on immigration and facilitates the elimination of clandestinies is referred to as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence emphasized both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Napolitan Georgia meeting Benedicto XVI to the Quirinale requested the State and the church to work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of the price-features up to 900 euros for a room
The market of universities does not know crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, the surveyist, taking a single room, can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 to Firenze, 650 to Napoli, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characteristics to exclude the entire facility of young people from the right to the study for the highest comprehensive costs that the families of proven should support - explaining the responsibility of the Sunia’s study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand by students has so much deformed the market to involve a generally increased process also for the residents."
In most cases, the offers of availability contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without limits of canon, linked sub-affits.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxes, they can calm the prices.
In view of the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bedroom in the Brisa area, there were about 450 euros; for a single room, you go from a minimum of 650 (Nighty Band zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
On Florence a bedroom costs average 350/400 EUR, a room around 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on the nearest areas at the university, 250/280 euros for a bed in a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome, near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single camera) in areas near the other universities (Osteanese and Science).
Only if you move to Perifer Area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centokelle and similar area.
In Napoli for a bedroom, there were EUR 300/450, for a room depends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, there were EUR 250/350, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have more weight in the urban economy.
In the towns where the phenomenon of foreign students, such as Perugia, is finally registered by another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of canon requested for foreign students than those applicable to Italians.
Old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historical salt
The historical film sales close to the multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic salt is a blind city, it is like a ball without eye."
The image offered by the register Giuseppe Tornator is efficacy as it happens in the large cities of Italian, but also in the cities of the province.
The cinema marginalization process, with the born in periferity of the great multisale and the corresponding death for consumption of monosals in the central areas of the city, is one of the events that have us unleavenable and inconvertible but also have all the characteristics of a true and cultural crime.
There are often historical places and memory cards," it is like if you were less a friend, whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions," observes the registry of New Paradise cinema, the film that twenty years ago was valuable to Tornator, the Oscar Prize and the Great Prize of the Jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a provincial room and the nostalgia to live in a way that may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the militarys, are clear: in the past five years, the battles of 316 traditional films have closed, and pay the largest outcome are especially the sales in the main cities: 10 in less to Florence, 9 to Milano, Napoli, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less than Torino, 5 to Palermo.
Among the most assaulted regions, the Emilia-Romagna with 82 persic monosala films, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And demonstrating that the first responsible for their loss is the event of multix, these are just the three Italian regions that have made recording the largest number of new multisala films: 195 schemes in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 both in Toscana and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has been irrationally developed” observes Paul Protti, President of Anec, who is useful to build new structures but would be to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a town room closes, not all its visitors are willing to transfer to multix.
For not talking about the lack of fund for exercises: the State’s pre-related debt is around 10 million euros.
It is honourable, from the ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros each year."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, who, concerned about the closure, decided to run the repairs with the signing of a Protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala films both in the historical and peripheral center.
Among the rules laid down there are tax facilitation measures for the managers and benefits of the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter in the limited traffic area and will have special tariffs for the floor and in some parks.
"It's a initiative that I like," observes Joseph Tornator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna, putting on foot other measures.
However, in order to contrast multiplex-based sales, traditional sales must also improve the quality of the sound and image, because the public is more required today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Superkine of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the single that convinced me to do "New Paradise Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walked before the Rialto or the Cyril of Nationalweg now closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, to not see the powdered cards turning me to the other side."
Legague between the political and 's synagogue arrested by Joia Tauro
"The synagogue of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the choices of the Comune to the interests of the Piromalli coasque."
It is hard for the accused that the magistrates of the California Antimaphia Directorate turn to the synagogue and vice-six of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the sindac of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for a foreign concours in mafious association.
In hands also Joacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandfather, the boss' homosexuality, already condemned for association for mafious stamp crime, condemned to restore 10 million euros.
"In any legal and moral standard, as well as in good sense," the applicants write, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would be so granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to be officially entering within the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, ingest, control and address of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Countries Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collections between local and unorganized institutions there are many" in its region: "There are areas where mafious intensity is stronger than in other countries, where collision is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'andrangeta', heroes that keep clean.
Tonight's arrests follow those of July last with which the police announced that Piromallli coast was decapped.
From the end of April last, the Joia Tauro Joia's Joia Tauro Common Council was discovered but already in 1991, and always for prevailing conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians were subjected to the task of administration of the Common.
Dayrgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's synagogue at the moment of the shooting, was elected by the head of a central side coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He cryed to the scandale when the Prefecture ordered the dissemination of the Common Council.
He called in question the next Vice-Miniti Internal Marco Minniti's vice-minister, accusing him of having architettu everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed tonight, explain that the Cosca Piromalli cosque was coming to ask the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered towards Dal Torrione, they write pm, it is emerged that "the possibility of marrying the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a greater group of nightly near the Piromalli, harmonizing the choices of the public administration for cosca interests".
When energy is born from where the larges are now scene
It's a slow-scale, which is more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now discover the great global energy companies.
Where, driving, sea are the new renewable sources on which they have put the eyes, and now they try to put the hands, rolled as the Chevron.
The possibility of recover energy from the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price slowed around 1980, the idea of exercising marine energy was taken by part, but now the environmental stages and the new increase in the oil makes an impact on the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity requirements could be covered by marine marine systems.
This amount would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear centers.
And more, there would be the flights and the seas.
You're on the attack.
The first company to switch on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 settled an agreement to build an installation in the north of Portugal.
When the intent was announced, I was seen a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to spend on marine energy, they are always more and among these enterprises that have always been voted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technology - he declared the portfolio of a company associated with the United States oil colosse to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and it is evaluating the opportunity to cooperate with us."
The cooperation concerned relates to the obtainment of a permit by the United States Energy Commission, necessary to start a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a sign not soon, especially if it is considered that in Alaska it is still used to extract oil, and recently President Bush has started a plan for new tripulations.
In addition to Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the New Jersey Ocean Power to walk the road from the sea and the sums invested until then, as not in details, they indicate that observers are interested.
Technology to put on the point.
The experts are talking about a technology still to the trees, even because marine energy is not all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, the installations such as the Portuguese or some in Scotia are small and they do not seem to create great ecosystem problems.
In order to produce energy on large scale, however, technologies should be used with more environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a boe system associated between them.
The spin of where, which makes the bows move on and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the gallengers.
The pressure makes a turbine turning a generator at its time.
Electricity is sent to riva via submarin caves.
For now there are four installations of this type in the way of design, in waiting for federal approval and part of energy could serve for military installation.
Instead, Verdant Power already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when the seas are turning the torbin pales, creating a rotative movement that produces a generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the place, it's the sea.
A particular interest, they say to the Electric Research Institute, now merge the potential of the sea.
Although it is a intermitting phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or where, and therefore more reliable as energy source.
It is just on the energy of the seas that were like the New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others in the costs, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and planned to invest up to 35 million for 2009.
