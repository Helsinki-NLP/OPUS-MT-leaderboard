Barack Obama will be the Fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Prize of Peace
The American President Barack Obama will join Oslo to Norway for 26 hours and be the fourth President of the history to receive the Nobel Prize of Peace.
The diplomacy, the medaille and the cheque of $1,4 million will be delivered, among others, for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The Chief of the White House, as well as his wife Michelle will be shooting in the Norwegian Metropolis and will have a program taken.
It will first turn to the Nobel Institute, where it will first meet the five members of the Committee who chose it in October between 172 and 33 organizations.
The planning of the Presidential couple then provides a interview with the king of Norway Harald V and the Queen Sonja.
The visit will know its sum in the afternoon at a single ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
It will be the Fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third that will take the price of the Committee itself.
The White House informed the advances that Obama would talk about war in Afghan during the transfer of prices.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because it is conscious that it receives this price as a President who brings a war in two countries at the current time.
He strengthened the war efforts for a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghan, which would not forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish corones (approximately 1,1 million euros).
He has given good works, but has not yet been fully decided to do things.
His programme will then take it as well as his wife to a banket, including the king and the king of Norway, the Head of Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was instead reciprocal to that price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling of not fully respecting it.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as he.
Since the announcement, he said that it would be an invitation to act for him.
A defender of the accused nature of chantage
The police of Litomśice was changing the President of the Association of the Protectors Society of the Nature of Litomśice.
In the past year, he called for several construction chain procedures and requested money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange of his call, said Alena Romova, the police's portal.
The President of the Society of Protectors of Litomśice is Lubomír Studnička.
It is currently in detention and risk until three years of imprisonment.
The three skins of waste are not at the parfum in Brno
Everyone in Prague can spend his drinking packages, while in the southern Moravian villages you're falling on three swimming pools at each street round.
And Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before finding the appropriate bends.
I don't mean that we wouldn't try all the waste in Brno.
But I am impressed that the municipal advisers of our city, the second larger city of the country, do not have enough interest in this problem.
Brno is at the age of the three of the waste not only because citizens can still try paper, drink and PVC, but especially to see the number of bends given to these wastes.
Have you already tried to put a plastic bottle in the center of the villa?
It's all a science, which requires especially time and nerves of axe.
The only place I found for the moment is the place of the Morbian face of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Subka and his colleagues don't want me, but that seems very little.
Unless talking about the fact that in other cities of the city it isn't a smooth.
So to end, many of my friends do not trie their waste.
It's like.
That makes them a strike to get up to the bends.
It doesn't make me aware of them.
I himself, after a party, I proposed to go get some drink and PVC blue.
Except that I didn't see any color rings in the Kounicova street.
Happy I found the suitable place by taking the tram.
That says, the waste was cut off.
It's after the whole center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and pretended sthestism do not take too much interest in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first hockey ligate that hurts the city in the whole country, instead of buying a few additional bends and offering more than three of the first materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have comforted my impression with official statistics after a moment on the Internet.
According to the EKO-COM society data, Brno is really the worst of the Southern Morbian region.
Paroubek's budget was removed from the retreatment and disorders
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials, there may be a lack of money for recruitments, illnesses or households.
But also for the interests in the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, said the Minister of Finance of Eduard Janota.
When social-democratics and communists implyed the increase in some classs, they were based on the fact that the government would make the premiums for sensitive expenditures, retreats or illnesses. "There is not only resolving the problems later, mining the land," said Janota.
It is necessary to know that money payment interests are increasingly higher and that the refund will be required soon or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where money powers.
If it does not decrease social aid or expenditure, taxes should be increased.
To all those who are left now increased: pompiers, institutors, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid of their retreats or disease insurance, including 1.8 billion.
But at the expenses of a larger end of the State - the next year he would therefore not lose 163 billion in casses, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow rapidly and with it, the interest-related expenditure.
The State will need money for repayment and no longer will be sufficient to slightly increase TVA or to reduce maternity as the government has made in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to finish the constructions of roads and roads because of the transfer of money to a number of election groups.
This is mainly the decision-making and approached thromboses which are not possible to change projects to reduce costs.
Always keep them, what isn't now free.
This means slowing or stopping three large cynicians, and the prepayment of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka's guarding, the portal of the Ministry of Transport.
The SSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very properly - it will be able to be in the dividends of the EZZ (producer and electrical distribution distributor), which the State has in major part and will feed transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case of a fundless pound.
Last year, there are 18 billion people who have been shipped from the EZB to the budget.
Each year, dividends serve to pay the removal of ecological defects, to complement the retrait accounts or to serve a reservation for the reform of retreats that are prepared.
In addition, this increases the real deficiency of the higher budget of 5.7 per cent of the NCB in accordance with EU rules.
And it's far to be the end of the transfer carnaval.
The budget for various distortions to the victims of communism and crimes, even households, has reduced almost three billion.
It is not sure that the State could act without that money.
It's a loterie.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it in any way, found Janota.
The Minister should then economize the side of the Department or, in the worst case, touch the Government ' s budget reserve.
It is also lacking 100 million to the State Case project of a value of two billion, which should allow to monitor online the expenditure of each administration.
The first step will start in January.
If the Ministry of Finance did not find any other money, the project should be stopped and sanctions would be done, it warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operation systems
In the future, the United States will consider a portable phone that will allow the user to pass from an operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's enough with a button and you're passing from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the American VMware society, which is mainly the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your portable phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professionals
The two will work at the same time, Mrs. Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for computer magazine world.
He was presented in November of the last year and was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones does not result in fiction.
VMware has already presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 changed with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full shore.
VMware company is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and clients should have access to current devices in 2012.
The neighborhood in the mountain trace the hotels
Desired pistes are not a problem only for remote-speed operators.
The lack of snow disappoints people to reserve their stay at ski in hotels and pensions.
Indeed, it is always possible to start free rooms for all data in winter, including Christmas and the New Year.
We have many visits on our website.
Interior people find the offers, demand the prices, but do not impose to reserve for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether there will be nice or swimming in Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operating from the Spindl.Info portal.
If we want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerv Mlýn, it's better to be preserved.
If economic priority is given and the quality of hosting comes only later, then you can try to wait for a few days.
The hotels of Špindler propose only a weekly stay for the New Year.
I think they're going to try again a moment to enjoy them, but they'll also go and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Inground Tourism Agency of Vrchlabi also proposes free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared some stays of Christmas in the last few minutes," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schifert.
The Tourism Agency of Vrchlabi can also propose the New Year in Krkronoše, but there are less free places.
The first quarters of February also go well, the remaining winter stays are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is not always black in Krkonoše.
People's waiting for her to cut down.
No one wants to pass the winter to the mountain without darkness.
If the tracks are recovered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schifert thinks.
Instead, the Orizont Hotel occupation in Pec Pod Snōkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have some 5% improvement.
We remain some last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Janvier holidays in Poland and Fevrier also sell well", reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Opnia hotel near the central Yanské Láznō is also completed to 4-20 percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty to Christmas in the most recent Yanské Láznō hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of Janvier, where we have already seven percent of occupation at the current time.
Feb is a little lower for the moment, but after the nest goes down, the interest in staying in the Krkronoše will certainly increased the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hotels of Krkronoše should not expect more black.
Thursday, he will be more featuring and if there are precipitations, they should be neglected in the mountain.
But afterwards, the time should be renewed, report Jiśí Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeatment is the mother of wisdom
It is even comic, the effort that Barack Obama, President of the Reputation of Wisdom, was to reproduce the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, that he would consider himself as a simple.
When he ended to let his doctrine be so drunkly expected, he noticed that he had collected it to the carbon paper since the irakian scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "comme in Iraq," he has not hesitate, which is, moreover, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road in advance"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea to send new reliefs to an Iraqi consumed by civil war as "unresponsive and catastrophic decision in his consequences".
However, the following months showed that the Bush Strategy, which had recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and potential success that the newspapers at the current time did not speak of all Iraq.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, and it said, Objectively speaking, he left his successor a more favourable final situation that could not be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will play in Afghanistan
These are again the campaign commanders who requested him an increase in the military contingent, including the army commander of the Afghan Operation, General Stanley McCristal, who had even severely criticized the restraints of the White House, despite subordinating habits.
He requested 40,000 men to make the most favorable situation.
The Chairman has engaged for three months but without a better option, at least 10 000 soldiers were shocked.
He succeeded to extend the promise of 5000 additional ones from Europe, even though it was 10 000 originally.
What leads to the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be its intention to remove Afganistan's army from 18 months and to end all this process of three years. All Obama doctrines make more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubts that a half increase will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite frastrious wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite effect - no person can be taken into account and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change the day of leadership according to their arrangements.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which the patriarchal ethnic relations will be proliferated.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, taking into account the lack of clarity of reports, which are still complicated by Pakistanian and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "speaking state", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of the Obama strategy makes it complex from its voluntaryism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghan has only been empowered and is currently on the board of the chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of the reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent to the torch of the war for their "approximly return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, the definition of a date for the retirement of the troops is absolutely irresponsible, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirect defect of the United States.
The Latest Summit of the NATO showed that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghan is orientated to the negative.
European policies don't know or want to explain to their electors what security is linked to war in the hills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically affect the situation is the evolution of Iran's events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iran, the United States will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem by means of military force.
For example, it should be answered at the time that, according to Obama, America will come to the victory retreat of Afghan troops.
However, each solution of this type will lead to dramatic return of the Afghan situation.
The only calm for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to put it on a new strategy, where it would be a total feast.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will not receive liquid money primes
High-leading employees from the American Goldman Sachs will not receive this year of species prizes.
The company announced it to react to the strong critics of its salary practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to return for five years.
Actions may be removed to leaders when they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is a file head of the efforts to connect rewards with long-term performances at Wall Street.
I think that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense we need to take, indicated the old investor Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan
The concern is found in details, it has added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the goal of critical target after almost 17 billion dollars for prizes on the first three quarters of this year.
For the present year, the total amount of premises will probably exceed $20 billion, despite the announced measure today, according to the Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensible political issue in many countries.
The Great Britain announced merger that it was counting to affect a single tax of 50% of the banking shops of over 25,000 books.
France will prepare similar measures.
Women received Nobel prices in all horrible fields in this year
These are five women, a number of records received today in Stockholm's hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prices in technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was the German writer Herta Muller.
Two American Biologists, Elizabeth Victoria and Carol Greider received with their companion Jack Szostak the Nobel Medical Price for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry price was decreased by the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishhan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of the ribosome
The last lauréate received the Nobel economic price, the American Elinor Ostrom with her companion Williamson, for their analysis of the economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been lauréat this year was the physical.
This price has been delivered to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their inventation of CCD pools, which are currently based on all digital, fax or astronomic photos.
Each lauréat received the diploma, Nobel Medaille and the acquire certificate of the penalty reward.
This reached ten million Swedish corones in each category. (It was about 1,1 million euros)
If one of them contains several lauréats, they will share the reward among them.
The very expected Nobel price of peace has already been transferred to Oslo in Norway to President Barack Obama.
This, in his speech, recognised the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his course and it is also the head of a country involved in two wars in Iraq and Afghan.
At the delay of his policy, he added that war is essential in some situations to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota intends to dismiss. Klaus invited him to Chasseau
President Vaclav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance of Eduard Janota on Friday Monday, which puts his stay to the Government on the basis of its dealing with the State budget for the next year as voted by the Chamber of Members
It is estimated that the budget and may also the position of Janota to the office will be on the agenda of their fedday.
It is also critical for the budget.
According to him, deficit is too important, which is more than the crisis of public finance.
It's the presidential port, Radin Ochvat, who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss on his funding on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subjected to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion corones that the Czech Republic should be managed.
However, the Chamber of Members was valuable to mere the left proposals on money transfers and increased the payment of officials, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of democratic socials that they would indirectly increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between the left of one side, the Government, Klaus and the right of the other part, a degree which is subject to the future of the Fisher Office, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
The critics argued that the budget, as voted by the deputy, removes the pack of economic measures passed by the fisher government and should, according to it, end up the State's detention.
Klaus, who is able to ratifie the State budget, but not obliged it today at a small breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, said that policies have long denied the "serial problem" of the "unrespectable deficiency" of public finance.
Now there is no favourable solution, according to him.
Only a strong government could make a improvement, if it could support a broader consensus of the political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mirec Topolánek stated that the budget is scared and that the Government should deal with its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an Administrative Office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Greens is not clearly working.
In his reaction, the first minister Fischer qualified such words of "drastic verdicts".
The chief of Jiśí Paroubek reacted to Topolanek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former government of Topolanek is scared and that it will exceed 200 billion corones.
Mercredi already has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The Population Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new client Eastwood film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new film of Hollywood Invitus - Invaincu will exhibit many things in the world, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sports, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, the United States Rewarded at Oscars, incarcered Nelson Mandela's life film, unfavourable fighting against the racist regime of South Africa and the first black President.
Freeman stated that it's a mandela's age of fourty-two years that asked him to incarcerate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarn you, I should be able to see you personally..
The age of seventy-two years of age that was rewarded of a price for his role in the Millennium Dollar Bay in Clint Eastwood box, for example, has incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery itself, a firm president of the United States, even even God in the film Evan All Power, but never a person of living and an important fear for such people that Mandela is.
The former man of South African State was prisoned for 27 years of his work in favour of the end of the apartment in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was decreased the Nobel Peace price.
Invitus is a Latin word significantly invaining and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the real history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African Ruby Team to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected that his country remains still and has always been rationally and economicly divided after the apartment.
It is convinced that it can join his people through sport and decide to join the ruby players who are among the foreigners worldwide.
The South African team will end by progressing in the world Coupe in 1995.
Freeman has worked a few years to bring Mandela's story on a large screen.
I had no other goal, except playing this role in order to approach it the most reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was sure to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in cold before his speech.
The most important for him was to shut his hand.
I realized that when I shut your hand, I get your energy, she's transferred and I've been impressed to know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienar, the capital of a national ruby team where there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare a role in the hard medium of the ruby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I told to Francois Pienar was: "I looked much larger in the film."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invitus under the wood of Eastwood realist received positive opinions and even it is spoken of ambitions for the Oscars.
The criticism of the films Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety reported its appreciation in the words: "This is a very good story, a very good film."
In film evaluations on the Rotentomatoes.com site, Invitus received 76 per cent of positive values.
The mystery of aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a smoke
A strange light phenomenon was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry has recognized that since then he tested an intercontinental balistic fusion not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the lancement was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile that was to be the fierity of the Russian army progressively becomes the cashmar of Russian generals and the first Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the fusion test did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava hasn't been bound, or it hurted in full flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "misil that doesn't want"
A missile that doesn't want, but who's lighting
This 13th test was normally started.
It's just at the end of the flight that there are again disgates on the device.
It's clearly the motor of the third stage of the shooting that explosed.
This time, "Bulava" was engaged in the sub-marin Dmitri Donskij, which shipped under the White Sea surface.
This kind of mixture can be made just on fire of an embarrassment in movement and strike
This is the reason why the mysterious light above Norwegia caused by an unidentified object that has been clearly identified as a defective "Bulava".
Otherwise, the Norwegians did not give up a moment that it is a Russian fuse.
Generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the shooting resisted, and the shooting had touched only the third.
In the previous case, engines have known difficulties in the first stage.
Although no test launch has occurred, the defence Department's headquarters considers that only six up to ten have failed.
This succeeding rate of almost 50% is, therefore, involves the generals of optimism, and therefore they state that one day "Bulava" will want to want to be a problem and that it will even bring ten hypersensual nucleus to a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetissov signed 51 years of a year with the CSKA Moscow
Legendary Defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again be presented in a professional game in 51 years.
The former world's champion, olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will handle his CSKA Moscow's team in the need and will probably make his entry into the Petrograd sale game.
Fetissov, who finished his career for forty years in 1998, is timely the CSKA President.
After Denis Kuliash's blessure, we need a other defender.
Fetissov is regularly conducted and agrees to help the team.
We still need to run some details on the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchnov club, quoted by the AP Agency.
It was not specified if the comeback of the hockey legendary player is only one match.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the glass, Fetissov is thus the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the Legendary attacking Gordoe Howe played a whole season for Hartford and reached 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famed fiveth Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those who have best success.
Under the Soviet Union colors, he doubled the gold to the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, triumphed Canada Cup as well as the June World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected the males in NHL where he held Stanley Cup for two times.
He is a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the signs and cancel all the additional hours
The direction of the Hyundai plant of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional hours.
It is just because of the additional hour that the trademarks declared a state of emergency in Monday.
Petr Vanśk's parliament, Hyundai, confirmed it.
However, the guideline wants to agree with the trade unions on a summer that was still working this year.
We can't reject our production plan, it's essential, that is why further voluntary hours have been proposed on Saturday 19 December, as we know that there were two teams, said Van zuk.
The Sedmička.cz site stated that the company proposed a bonus 400 Czech Koreans to employees that would be part of the samedi team.
It will also be assigned to poster for the working day on November 28.
The company, according to Vanśk, decided to change the way to move its employees in exchange of additional hours.
If they receive the supplement for more hours, or they can make a replacement seat on December 28 and so extend their final yearly feasts indicated by Vanōk.
In addition to this, all present workers will receive compensation for transport costs and for their dinner.
In view of the fact that additional hours were the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and recurrences of the unions as employees who spontaneously stopped the production last week, the direction took the immediate decision to cancelle all additional hours for the month of December, said Van zuk.
By the last week, the employees of the car industry were forced to work nearly daily two additional hours in more than eight hours.
Syndicates account for cancelling the state of greenland after the signing of the Agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the car and the trade unions must be held on Thursday after midday.
The Sindical Chief Petr Kuchaś declared merry that they were ready to stop the state of greve in case of agreement on their revendications and signature of a common document.
The situation in the manufacture culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously engraved because of inadequate additional hours.
They also protested against the bad wages and predicts of awesome.
The direction was defended by the fact that employees had to work additionally in order to comply with the imperatives in the field of car production.
When the advertising of the Monday Great, the tradeers also requested that employees who had stopped the production are not subject to any sanctions.
Syndicates request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours at least.
Moreover, they want a reward of $5,000 corones for these.
Hyundai de Nošovice is currently employed by 2 000 people.
It started the production in series last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that functions on HIV virus also
A Czech and German scientist team tests new combinations that can raise HIV virus proliferation in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
In some cases, this reality takes the fact that combination does not so intensely affect the current variants of the virus as well as certain medicines already available.
It is not possible to curate AIDS at the current time.
However, the life of nurses can be radically prolonged through a mix of medicines that prevent HIV virus multiplication in the body.
However, their consumption causes a series of secondary effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of what is called resistant viruses on which medicines have no more effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic, the VSCHCHT of Prague and the Heidelberg University opened the way to face the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metamarbolans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
The metabolisms are a assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all medicines that have been used until now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researcher's work leads them to discover new "enhanced substances", based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connections on virus proteins.
Metabolisms have a unique threedimensional structure: two paris boxes are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected with a metalic atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus tragic and resistant.
HIV protection is a protein of HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protection, there would have been no birth of infected viral mass mature parts.
If HIV protection is stopped, the proliferation of virus in the body of the patient will also be stopped, explaining researchers in a press communication published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemia of the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic.
In their works published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficiency of this series of substances on HIV protections has been tested in tests as well as on its resistant variants, obtained in HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metamarbolans is not so strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not require the existing versions against which current medicines are often inefficient.
The metamarbolans, with their unique action mechanism and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting to investigate more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína śáčova, director of the structural biology laboratorium of organic and biochemia Institute and the Instituto of Molekular Genetics of Science Academy.
Deputy around the budget. ODS takes it to Fisher, which defends
The Chairman of the ODS (Democratic Citizen Participation), Miek Topolánek qualified the budget ratified for the next year and according to him, the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should return to its existence in question.
The First Minister has qualified the proposals of the Drastic Green ODS.
He said to take time to analyze.
The ODS Petr Nečas's speaking port declared that the idea of a administrative office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was not clearly working.
According to Nečas, the Head of the Government should decide if it is in the House of Deputy on the Support of Minority that is concerned to fight the growing deficit, or if it is concerned to remain in its functions with the support of the Parliamentary Left.
Nečas warned that the positions of ODS and democratic social in relation to public deficiencies are diameterly opposed.
The Chamber of Members has ratified the budget for 2010, but the proposals for amendments for a higher of 12 billion corners including the left.
The Chamber has increased the money for staff salaries, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The Government's grief against the proposals for democratic social was the fact that they indirectly increased the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion corones.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, following the Government's desire as a changed budget is less bad than an interim budget.
Deception and inutility
Eduard Janota has spoken of deception and feeling of inutility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the Government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave its functions in the case of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took you Monday with the Prime Minister after his transition to the Government:
He indicated at the same time that he asked whether he would remain in his functions.
It is the reason for negotiations around the budget.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that representatives of the SSD, which have imposed budget changes, do not have their place in the Government.
The first minister should also clearly say that it will be denied if the Chamber ratifies the other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting disease, restraints, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolianek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
It's the case of the Chief of the Fisher Government and the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing to prejudice, emphasized Topolánek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the Vice-Ministers of certain ministers claimed to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decided to give his demission to the fact that it was struggled against the deficit of public finances, " it's absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently at the Chamber " .
This says, it should not be expected to support and tolerance democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it will be on the agenda then I will be dedicated to it, it has stated from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence of Martin Bartak, elected to the government just by the democrats.
The first Minister Fischer took place at the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has walked back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas emphasized at the same time that the ODS probably had voted on the amended budget if it had not expressly requested the Democratic Members to allow the budget vote.
We have no feeling of being orphelins, isn't it small children, has it reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered reproaches from the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I have not noticed that my vote would be valid.
I already knew at the time I rejected my mandate that what would be followed in the next months would be a crowd of the Chamber and a destruction of everything that had been positive, the Topolanek reacted individually.
According to the new timelines of D.D., there will be less trains for the same rates.
Czech iceways will be removed or limited from 13 December some explicit or regional trains which are less loaded and strengthened by some other.
The total coverage of transport will be low on the day of entering into force of the new time of two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariff and reduced tariff.
This is, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the iceways will join a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an expression will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague line - Pisek - śeské Budōjovice, the direct Prague line - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decline in transportation in the Hradec Kralové region of eight per cent in total, instead of Prague and its surroundings, can be satisfied with increased.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - ˌeské Budśjovice are also cancelled and the movement of several express trains on the Prague line - Pisek - śeské Budōjovice will be reduced only a few days in the week.
Among the largest transformations, you can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time the people of Milovice must change Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifth line of Esko Ballion system, which is possible by the completion of the line between Lysaá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main chair of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraśí).
The śD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains at destination of Šumperk/Jeseník will go through two-hour intervals.
The travellers will not be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from 13 December.
The facture this year for regional iron roads: 200 million additional corones.
Express trains are commanded and paid by the Department of Transports and will be paid to the Railways next year in all four billion corones to resolve the visible losses, or the same amount as this year. Regional trains are commanded by the regions who pay for them for a total of eight billion in the next year, whereas the State will participate in almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more cherished.
Railways newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the period was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not return to a price increase in the large majority of transport titles.
Changes will only affect the tickets of a day śD Net and eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without reducing card, the net price will increase from 450 to 600 krones.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the parking trail, while until there he was valid among cities of a region and was at a single tariff of 160 corones.
The rebellious rebels remain more than 50 persons, children have been abandoned
The rebellies today took 75 people in the south of the Philippians, among whom some students from a primary school and their institutions.
It's the AFP Agency who informed it, but he talked about the origin of 65 days only.
17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the institutions.
The opposition took place in the province of Southern Agusan.

The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman Alis Mandela
The new Hollywood film from Clint Eastwood arrives in the United States rooms in the next days, the title is Invitus (the official title is Invitus: Neporaśenī), and born a part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the worldwidely known apartment was returned to Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen for years by Mandela himself for incarcering it.
The second male role of the South African Legendary Legendary Champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, critical returns and the public are heard.
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
On June 18, 1918, he was born in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he obtained the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace price at the side of Klerk.
He was President from South Africa 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a moment when one of South Africa is fully prepared for the cut of football world, and on the other hand because the media are affected by new concerns about the increased racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority of the power.
According to the AP Agency, the reactions to the new film are at the time very positive in South Africa, despite the frequencies reserves issued to the main roles in which Hollywood stars are "passing".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by re-examining his own terms.
I rejoiced of this role for years and I've been well prepared.
I have also kept seeing Nelson Mandela personally for power - as we say - recovering energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think that's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the personality and message of Mandela through the film.
It's the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it's regarding each person who has joined it.
To get the maillot from the National Rurby Team
The film based on the history of the Roman of the British writer John Carlin was freely translated. In the role of the enemy, Nelson Mandela and the part that gave his creation to the people depends on the South African defender of human rights during his term to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries to collect two racial groups of a long-divided population, and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he entered the national maillot of the South African team on the shadow of the world, which then had reported South Africa.
In order to be shown on the skin in maillot, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela was long-term on the white public over 14 years ago and was recognized by the white people.
We hope that the football championship will be successful to join people again in a single country, stated the ruby player of Chester Williams, who was the only "noir" of the national team in 1995.
It is still to see whether the South African tendency will improve.
The South African whites, however, are sceptics, as recently confided in a holding for LN Christopher Dawson, a ruby fan who went to the Great Britain.
The Championnat started on 11 June 2010.
A valuable transformer of tens of millions of flames in the Louny region
A fire rose in the morning a transformer of the company śeps from the distribution center near the town of Vøškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the portal of Usti Pompiers, there are six units that worked on the fire.
They were counted to let the transformer become consumer, but they reviewed their opinion and extended the fire with a mixed of water, museum and a special substance.
The cause is a technical default, a short-circuit of the transformer.
No one was hurted, and according to Pavla Mandatova's parliamentary port, the incident does not risk the safe function of the whole transmission.
The damages are estimated to a few decades of millions of corones, the exact number may be known once the end of the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new.
It acknowledges that in ten years of activity, the company Šeps has not known anything likely and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
The current electrical supply has not been interrupted, declares the parliamental port of the Employee ΒEZ for the Northern Boeme Sośa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. śeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory of transmission assemblies and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.

Jančura will make a complaint for dismissing against three prefects of  yang
Radin Jančura, owner of the University Agency, is going to make a complaint today for dismissing three democratic social preferences.
Concretely against Michal Hašek in the South Morbian region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesaśík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minutes from Radioṣṭurnal.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of the company to explore regional flow routes in certain regions.
However, all regions have concluded by signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that the finish are done, while only a offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more pretty than the Czech iceways that isn't true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that have been signed last week.
So there's only to defend us.
It is in exchange of calamities on the University Agency, said Jančura at Radiočurnal.
He also stated that there have been evidence that no region has been done in accordance with the European law.
We prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complainant deposit by Mr Jančura represents the follow-up of his mediatic spectrum that serves to him free advertising for his society and for his person.
I am very willing to defend my name and name of my region, and I call the other preferences to do the same.
I believe that this will be the opportunity to clearly show that this is just Mr. Jančura who manipules public opinion and reiterates false and lie arguments on regional rail transport, said Hašek.
Jančura has already informed the last week that he will invest a few million corones in an advertising that will mention the degradable movements of the regions.
He stated to Radioōurnal that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he will take it back after the New Year.
He explained that the campaign will see corruption in a wide sense.
Jančura undertaked its campaign after the regions agreed to engage in the Czech Railways in the exploitation of rail connections for an order of approximately 150 billion corones without calling for offers.
According to Jančura, such a manner is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even brought to Jančura the threats of a Member of SSD.
The only threat was that if we weren't left, we could lose our bus license.
He has presented himself as a deputy of  yang has the SSD, I don't know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today in Radioōurnal.
The vaccination against muscles will be free and optional
The vaccination against the mocks will turn the old habitats since Janvier.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
The votes are already exaggerated, saying that a binding vaccination would be more effective.
Preparatory for the introduction of free vaccination against culming pneumonics.
The pharmaceutical institution already defines the maximum prices that will pay disease insurance.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August may be vaccinated freely against the mocks.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the vaccination has been started last year or later, the following vaccinations should be paid itself.
The first vaccine dose should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a fourth of the families have voluntaryly vaccinated their children against skins.
However, the parents paid 1600 corones even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that disease insurance depends on 300 to 450 000 corones in vaccine doses each year.
However, they economize the medical care that non-vacuated children needed.
To date, the State costed about 5000,000 corones per year for all children's vaccination.
The returned vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumonics are the cause of median ear inflammations, but also serious infections such as meant inflamation and blood infections.
According to hospital surveys, there is up to 28 children under 10 years of age caused by pneumonic infections.
Besides the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries introduced the remboursed vaccination.
Is vaccination binding?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation for the future.
From Janvier, it must be regulated by the insurance and optional.
For example, the President of the Nalas Rudolf Kalovský Association stated that a binding vaccination would be more positive.
His association has been a long-term vaccination against the pneumonics.
In an international conference to which our association has participated, specialists have not been really satisfied by the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we could have put this at least.
I think it's a direction that we need to follow now, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against the mocks.
We do not consider it absolutely for the moment, stated his Vlastimil Sršeу.
Facultative vaccination has its inconvenience, as a result of the doctors.
Hana Cabrnochova, President of the Pediatrists' Association, recognizes that a vaccination based on voluntary defaults.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a decline of vaccination renewment "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a amount I understand the decision to make the optional vaccination", said Cabrnochova.
Specialists expect that over 80 percent of new parents will vaccine their food since the next year.
The vaccination against the mocks marks a rupture of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochov explains that insurance should be released from prevention funds, and they would thus economize future medical care.
Medicines will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of practitional pediatrists, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurances, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccines provided by the State.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow insurance to "deduce the disease insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurances to repay them.
According to estimates, pediatrists should individually invest about 400,000 corones per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It will be far from being easy, according to Cabrnochova.
The son of a American artist involved in a Museo Wolf
The son of Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in the museum of his father.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was interrupted while he was loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and a retreat.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to strengthen the entry of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his designs of personalities such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press Agency.
AP mentioned a police officer that the young Mr. Frazetta could have been motivated by a family cousin.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, he claimed to have been authorized by his father to "in the museum for any means to transport the tables to a storage installation", reported the Agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior never had given such a authorisation, said the Agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defend tax increases and reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the critical opposition, enterprises and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "a lacked opportunity to show that it was serious to the deficit reduction by reporting its decisions to the elections.
The Chairman also touched the crowds by attacking basket salary and average salary.
Among its main proposals, a increase of 0.5 per cent of the Social Insurance and a low rate of 1 per cent on public salary since 2011.
The angry of social insurance
Syndicates protested that low wages are penalized by a recession which they are not responsible and made it safe that "problems" were announced.
The reduction of the social insurance, which will enable us to get about 3 billion GBP per year - has put the world of angry enterprises, because it is the tax on employment while the objective should be a relaxing of the economy.
The increase, reserved to those who win more than 20,000 GBP per year, will touch about 10 million employees.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET RAPPORT
Social Insurance will still increase 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will be further lower than 4.75% expected this year
New tax of 50% on banking shops
The increased tax on benefits of society for small companies has been abandoned
Rabais of electric vehicle taxes and eolians
Augmentation of refunds of 2,5%
According to the Tresor estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person who wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person wins 10,000 GBP by an increased 110 GBP.
Ministers said that their goal to reduce half of the deficit before 2013 was "faciliar decisions" but stressed that 60 per cent of additional tax charge would be of the first 5 per cent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, reaffirmed a increased tax increase and stressed that a reduction of expenditure was a "water bottle in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"They are important. They will allow us to divide by two the deficit, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was reliable and that the growth of the economy will be restarted at the end of the year.
However, the predictions of the Labour on economic growth - which will influence the amount it must take and the speed to which the deficit will be compiled - were doubted after the Chairman was obliged to review its first figures.
In his allocation, he said that the economy would probably decrease from 4,75% this year - well worse than the decline of 3,5% predicted in April - while the premium would be more than 3 billion GDP over the previous estimation.
"Opportunity missed"
The Conservators that will start on Thursday a new publicity campaign that warned against the "debt crisis" of the Labour claimed that the project to spend 789 billion GBP in the next six years was not viable.
The ministers did not have a credible plan on the way to repay, added, "cynically" of difficult choices towards elections, which must be held in June 2010.
"They had nothing significant about what they would do," said Philip Hammond, head-secret at the Fantastical Championer of the Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The major advertisements will be made after the elections, except the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloite
The Labour stressed that schools, hospitals and police will be protected by the next reductions, in contrast with the tory proposals that would lead to a rapid and significant deficit reduction.
However, the Lib Dems stated that the money collected through tax increase and expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting the plans "building on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's Political Editor, stated that the calendar of advertisements - such as increased inflation for some invalidity benefits in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chairman to face propaganda accusions, the money was simply recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour stressed that additional assistance is provided while people have the most need and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not have published the expenditure details over 2011, the economicists said that it was clear that the restrictions of public expenditure would not start to feel only a mid-term period.
The very respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto of Fiscal Educations) stated that the possibility figures in the future involve significant reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is only reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important advertisements will be made after the elections, except the winner," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser at the Deloite accounts.
"This was a false pre-budgetary report, and markets are well-known."
The FBI investigation on "Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI arrest investigation of five American reporters, suspected of extreme links.
Men were arrested at a root house in Sarhoda in the Eastern Province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared that they had been lost from their home in the American State of Virginia last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that it also searched for information on those persons.
Three of them are presented as Pakistanian ascendence, one Egyptian heritage and the other of Jemenite.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the accusions are against them and what conditions they are detained," said the speaker, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schwal, FBI's portal, stated that the Agency had known arrests and that she was in contact with the families of lost students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities in order to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really lost students," she says.
The Ambassador of Pakistan in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
It said that the house was already supervised by the local police and there was no accused to the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, rejected any comments on arrests, reported the Reuters Press Agency, but she stated that the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to delay the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to be recruited and formed."
The five students were lost from their home by their families, in North Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns the "abus" of Iran
In the past twenty years, human rights have been so lowly respected as ever, according to Amnesty International Association report.
the report presented by the regime "repeatings of violations" before and after the presidential election campaign of June.
One man mentioned in the report stated that he was struck and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he was threatened by violence.
Iran rejected the previous criticism of the non-respect of human rights.
The authorities claim that such critics are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and twelve were killed in Iran, after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinjad has led to the largest public manifestations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Douzaines were sentenced to prison penalties, and lawyers claim that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, from the BBC in Teheran, now claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our corresponding.
"Fussed condemnation."
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who was accused of working with the Facebook networks and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me into the face," he was quoted.
"I've been burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the head, on the head, they threatened me to execute and humilize me."
After five days, he signed a false condemnation, and he was released and left in the street, always in blood and half awareness, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that detented manifestants were tortured to die in prison and that others were violent.
Iranian authorities rejected the accused of violence, but they admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an older detention who said he had been closed in a container with 75 other persons, over eight weeks, in a centre of detention in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial device establish a Committee to investigate post-elected problems and the Government's response, but she stated that the mandate and powers of those bodies were not clear and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent other manifestations.
ski pistes built in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial nest were used to transform the Bristol site into a competitive track.
The eventPist in the Park (A piste in the park) has attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional semi-professional skies for species prices.
On the top of the Brandon Hill park, a small tremplin preceding a 100m long track.
John Hickman, student in the fourth year of physician, said that the view of the top of the piste was wonderful but that it was quite intimidating.
It's a wonderful view, with all the lights of the city singling in contrabase.
There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the country - of real talents", he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltile - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday evening, the nest will be abandoned to the source.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Latin State.
Roger Bootle, Deloite
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the Frenchians do not like the fould" (2006), a elegant and well-documented study on a problem that divided and worried the country for a fifth years and whose effects are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a very larger and ambitious trace.
Good anthropolog, he does not only want to know what political and media say about Islam in France, but what happens now in the country.
It has been over a few months in the museums, schools and institutions that now provide in France as Mr. Bozen calls "muslim spaces" for the 5m-6 m of Muslims.
He is very well-known to listen and reproduce discussions between teachers and students about the issues of them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a matrix (or both)?
Should the development and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young musulmans?
Can a musulman woman marry a non-musulman?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, and it affirms, which are the daily lot, rather than the political drags that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of images, teachers and intellectual, all unknown public, except Tariq Ramadan, a Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good musulman and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They do not have the debate so far.
The conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intelligence and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally agreed with their lawyers of a Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia, who are a small part of Europe's musulmans.
M. Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the French Law could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He asked how many French politicians (and intellectual guard elections so virulent of laity) are truly engaged inwards pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been managed, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historical commitments with the Lay-Republicism.
Before a growing pragmaticism, he detects a "strong of key values".
Is Islam may be French? After reading this book, it is tried to say "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The glass that composed is being found at an alarming speed, bringing with her a life that can't survive any other.
The oil, gas, expeditions and fishing move in new open waters, with diplomas, lawyers, and now writers in their sillage.
In "On a mix of glass," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, draws a natural history of the great North's symbol, the Poland smell.
Knowing the history and the complicated fishing policies in the ballet, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic operators that made their evidence by chasing the white smell.
The meeting of the Amiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old, who had not to fight only the point of his mouse, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young horns, captured when they were born at the side of their mother, all right killed, were attractived and sent to zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 19th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 ours at the same time.
Even today, the sizes of a zoo are generally a million of the surface required to an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar stone living in Singapore has become green because of the alges that were able to be in its swimming wool.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historic people and often returns to the threat that the chasors of the survival of species.
Despite the bans in Norway, America and Russia, the killers continue to be in Groenland and Canada where helicopters and Indians in Motoski use powerful smooth shooting shooters to catch their like.
Ironically, it's in the most northern waters of these two chase nations that the glass will remain as long as long.
In his new book, "Applause the glass," Alun Anderson, an old editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and emerging summary of the Arctic science and a captive view of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographs can precisely relate the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
Finally, at 19th and early XXear, Fridtjof Nansen pioneers gave the first information about the source of the glass helmet.
The submarins of the cold war then mapped the relief changes under that.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg sounds are a great help, but the largest work is made by endurcis men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson observes the extraordinary and small world of the Arctic glass tributary system, formed by the saumâtre water files pressed by ice.
But from the ear above the microscopical wonders contained in the glass, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer glass, prescribed between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our tour."
Marines, among the 60,000 people who put horns on the camps in Arlington
The first class De'Angel Robinson, 19 years old, took a seven-hour travel in bus to put a simple coron on the tomb of a soldier who had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Caroline at the Arlington National Cemetery Cimetière to decoration the stomachs, this day was dedicated to welcome men and women who, one day, were at their place.
In a few months, where we are sent, we can be their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to put corons on the tents of the veterans, in different sections of the Céremony ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundreds of murders in Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen are traveling every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize memories for militarys and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also found a non-governmental association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 corones on the cemetery of Arlington, around Pentagone, on the camps of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at the Battery Park in New York City and on the rememory site for the victims of the 93 U.S. Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $1500,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, a 70-year-old of Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in the honor of her husband, a deceived carriage military.
Although his husband wasn't entered in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It's a small gest that can make citizens to support our troops, did she say.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitted in several warm clothes, volunteers marketed between the sweet and the extensive smells of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old tombs, from the First and Second World War, as well as by the Vietnam war, because those are not often visited as new tombs, declared organizations.
Humeur was at the optimism, while children played and pairs were holding through the hand, taking the cost-free pin corners on the green tombs.
Each round corner had a red red color, with a small red papillon on the top.
It was closely planned to silence on Section 60, where most veterans of war in Iraq and Afghan are inhumaned.
The United Service Organization gave 1,000 corones to deploy the section, but the dark humor of the current wars implied the area.
People cry without hiding themselves, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read with high voice the names in the stone, while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, focused on the humid land for those who had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in the laugh, on the throat of his son.
She was part of Zanesfield, in Ohio, and led eight hours to get together on the Tower of the Marine Gunnery David Shane Spicer, died at the battle in July.
Nobody should never forget for what we're free... my son paid for that, did she.
"Longtimes after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
A American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and computers in the country, claimed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based on Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consulting authorities and U.S. Interest Section in La Havane are trying to have access to the detention arrested on 5 December.
The accurate accusities have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under a pretext of being "fearing".
All activities of the revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bigger bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentary that often writes on the way they are married and they are followed and harshed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to get rewards, but authorisations have always been rejected.
The detention of an American resident may increase the tensions between the Communist Government of Brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues to be a "douce approach" to improve the relationship with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Thursday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that the Cuban Government continues through concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can make it.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed to Cuba, although it is new and desired consumption goods in a country or the average payment of a staff is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted regular citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payment day.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings such as universities.
Cubans who want to be connected often must communicate their name to the Government.
The access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rarely incarcered Americans in Cuba are behind the barriers for drug trafficking such as Gloria Berbena, who was attached to the U.S. Interests Section in La Havane.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on arrest.
The arrest and detention are a great error.
An activity that, in any other open company, would be allowed - distributing mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Group, who recently published a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his old brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused is often arrested, was sentenced and sentenced on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction to the United States at the time when the two countries start to love a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a compliment to send men to Afghan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities reiterated an organization intended to prepare a compliment to send five men from North Virginia to Afghan to kill American troops, saying that this case would allow to demonstrate an important network of terrorist recruiters who are currently online in search of young people rooted.
The investigators claimed that they had a hidden insurgent personality, known under the name of Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they found them when one of them made comments on terrorist vagues on the YouTube video site.
In Pakistan, these men were guided by Safullah who tried to help them reach the reculated region of Pakistan's tribal ceinture, home from Al-Qaida and terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services that was informed about the case said that Saifullah did not convince Al-Qaida's commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA's compliance to infiltrate the terrorist network.
In fact, they were isolated for days in the Eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains from the northeastern East, became a refugee of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, declared a representative of the authorities expressed in the condition of maintaining the anonym as a result of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities argued that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the authorisations required to obtain the entry into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of those five men - who remain in Pakistan and who are interrogated by the FBI - is stressing the crucial role of contractors in identifying potential terrorists and maybe more important, in the determination of persons with confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States secret services have been priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barriers, rejecting the entry to those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment and those who may be sponsors.
According to analysts, potential American recruitments are closely studied by Al-Qaida.
But they are also very touching for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propagandary value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert on the NEFA Foundation, stated that terrorist groups should also be more attentioned, in the choice of people accepted by the fact that the United States secret services have become experts in respect of their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what best way to follow your recruit model as many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one more on the Internet.
Decades of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen demand a "action" for climate
Decades of thousands of protesters marketed in the streets, here, Saturday, demanding more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the House of the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of manifestants was estimated to 1000,000 people, but 25 000 according to the police estimates.
This event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of mass activists had cut some explosives near a whole of government buildings, in the center of the city.
In the day where little things happened during the discussions on the climate sponsorized by the United Nations, thousands of activists marketed by the city, employing pancarts in English, saying "No planet B" and one in Spanish, saying, "The Earth says that it is enough."
several celebrates were joined to protests, including the top model and photo of Denmark, Helena Christiansen, who stated that traveling to the country of his mother’s birth, Peru, opened his eyes on the desperate problems that must face the country because of the impact of climate changes that are already happening."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join me to the great step -- to pass the word and to call to the leaders of the whole world to take just, ambitious and engaged decisions, said she.
It is not a easy task, but it must be company, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the manifestants to get too close to the Bella centre and said that she was arrested by 19 persons because they had a mask or that they were in possession of pockets.
The police prevented the manifestants to get too close to the Bella centre and said that she was arrested by 19 persons because they had a mask or that they were in possession of pockets.
According to a passenger who asked to keep the anonymat because of its implication in climate discussions, activists with black masks and clothing have leaked several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is around some ministers.
They launched them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first of the shooting, followed by "this large explosions".
In the Congress palace, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the midst.
But it seems that the manifestants could not be able to wake up the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When he was asked if he thought that a manifestation would have a positive impact on international debates, he responded in English "In fact, that is something I did not have awareness.
Then he continued to Mandarin, saying: "The event is important, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that the walk could seem unfaithful or useful according to the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the large public and the various sectors in the area of climate change, said it.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they distract the negotiations or that they abuse the freedom of others."
The results of the tests show the tsunami distances between races
The federal report of the last week on the mathematical results brought a good news to the public schools at Washington D.C.
Although the Division remains far beyond the head institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more progress in the two years previous than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the last number of the National Educational Progress Assessment (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the continuing difference between the results of African and white people at both local and national levels.
The average results of white children of Grade 4 (cm1) at WashingtonD.C. in these two last years increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African Classs only increased three points from 209 to 212.
The degree of success has actually increased from 2007 to 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Africans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The general view of a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of children in the two groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the district expressed the concern that the increase in the growing rate by the Leader of Group of Educational Institutes Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) were promoted by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have highlighted the appeal by considering the elements above the scale, which is problematic and generous, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-government group that defends equality in the Department's education.
I do not feel joyful for one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic belonging to Democratic) Member of the Council of D.C., whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (First School).
A critical substance of the Rhee management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city need a careful attention.
Indeed, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what makes fear is that we do not consacre enough time and energy at our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been formed to use a new read method, the Wilson Reading System, for schools of the end of the elementary cycle and beginning of college, which have not incorporated the bases of read early in their school courses and are sufficiently late in comparison with their cousins.
Each day, the mathematic program for children's (maternal) classs in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, such as they have been established in the Division by the former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these students at the level lower than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP are the question of whether Rhee can continue to remove the general results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the difference.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California, who studied the results of the cities tests.
The conventional political solution is to provide your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Thus, this target may have political impact on this important programme.
But of course the problem is that, as other school overseers, she tries to serve as the average white and black class.
We focus on the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbor schools so that all families, anywhere they are originating, should be ensured that their children can get a excellent public education.
Janey, now the overseer of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce success levels was the duration of the traditional public school, today in the Washington District, to be in competition with the school Charters.
We need to get about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the trade of his teachers last year to reach 185 days, that it considers a "point of start" to get a further increase in the next contract.
A future promise for higher education
The bus was stopped in Gettusburg College with a long seal.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12-year-old, shut up and shut up a moment at the white columns, crap façads and green bones.
The parents of Graciela could only end the school in El Salvador.
As long as recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never put the feet on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students of Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where school costs are $38,690 per year, his attitude was less than that of a new enthusiastic student.
This is where I'm going to study! Graciela was explained that he wanted to study the doctor, while the guide was leading them to the entry of the science building.
Youpi, really? Did she sound, when it was indicated to him the low relationship professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh seventh visiting children during their three-day discovery trip, and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely addressed for the great number of American children born from Spanish immigrants who have left the school where parents have become adolescents, they are also hundreds of thousands of children to benefit from the university education that will allow them to enter the Medium Class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" on five-year-old studies at the school -- a notable success if it is considered as such as their immigrant parents, most of the Mexico or Central America, has entered in the United States without having completed the school.
Their success is important, they say researchers, and they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the work of the country.
The researchers who study battlers claim that they have natural affinity with the school and need to be successful.
Many are also those whom parents set high targets to their children and who find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentionate programs also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as they are going to reach to the university, in particular if their efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher in Davids, California University, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support for these children, from maternal to the school.
The federal program that financed the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Renounced on the name of GEAR UP , he provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programmes that start when low income family students are in school (college) and continue to end the years of school.
Since 1999, the program has been monitored by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent in university, according to the American Education Ministry.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded to address major oil companies in order to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two inquiries that have been completed in Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are to play a major role in the transfer of Iraq's oil industry, invalided by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are shared with a participation in only two of the 10 shopping fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second bond that began Thursday.
The only one who had put a snake lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for shopping fields in June.
The low representation of American oil generates in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Lastly, Iraq opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American society, Asian and European companies opening the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
There will be a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corrupted by massive, mardi coordinated bombs, and political instability, while the United States military troops removed the American oil corporations, prevented them to enter with more force in Iraq with the third largest world's world's oil reserve, are analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disvantaged because of their rivals, in particular Chineses and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose main work costs were significantly lower and were more ready to take risks because they did not take account of shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Petrole Minister and gave him their technical advice, are divided the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
China National Petroleum Corp., detained by the State, has been more covered on contracts than other companies and is shared with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is being a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, the portal of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equally with its competitors and will achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected enterprises for assignment of entrepreneurs have made offers that have then been compared to the bar tariff that the Ministry agreed to pay for the motive to the production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizations of Al-Qaida had been killed in Pakistan
It seems to be an American missile, shocked along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizations of Al Qaida's operations this week, declared the sale of American anti-spionship authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders of this autom.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected that they had been killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car, mardi near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities stated that missiles had been shocked by a non-pilot aircraft used by the CIA within the Anarchic Tribal Border of Pakistan.
They conducted a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was shocked, a member of Pakistani civilian services, expressed at Miran Shah's phone.
The representatives of the Authority said that the local suspected warriors were on the place and quickly confidenced what remained "totally discharged."
The local authorities were totally impossible to check the identity of victims, but the two American antiterrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida Military Organizationers who conducted the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghan Pakistan region.
His role was to organize compliments throughout the world, stated one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonym, quoting the sensible nature of aircraft within the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspirations against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic designs of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States authority stated that Somalia had progressed rapidly in the areas of Al Qaida's and had a very good relationship with other extreme groups in the region.
It may not be known about the great American public, but it does not reduce the threat that it is for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of warrants in the tribal ceinture, and three other operators.
The rythm of the attacks carried out by the CIA's drones has decreased from the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the numbers made by the Long War Journal, a web site modified by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing the suspected informators also unlikely states the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kaboul was retired
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghan, Kai Eide, declared on Thursday that it would be released from his post in March at the end of a smooth mandate to enlarged corruption allegations during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's department is at the time that Obama's administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase, but he expressed concern about the calendar of the United States for the retreat of troops that would start in 18 months, and which would oblig the other UNO Governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and recall them that they can trust in the international community, said Eide in a telephone holding of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diploma also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting political transition in Afghanistan.
Military increase must be copied by civilians, said it.
Eide said he would not leave but only respect his commitment to his family in March to pass only two years in Kaboul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it should be better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a white of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives argued that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; this is a citizen Italo-Switzerland who recently presided a United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French citizen who had previously conducted United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghan was tested after his former adviser, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused, in September, to promote President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to dismiss the evidence of massive election fraud.
He refused these allegations, but he said that the accused of Galbraith, which has been thanked -- "he had harmed the mission because there had already been a good dose of scepticism regarding the international observance of elections."
He stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civil representative to coordinate the assistance of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also emphasized the United Nations Responsibility to allow his successor to build more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it was not assigned to the mission in Afghan, saying that this would allow them to give greater confidence to their money.
He expressed its frustration on the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the huge United Nations employee regulations were able to provide new talents.
The United Nations rules are like that I couldn't recruit only one person since mai, did he say.
It's catastrophic and it can't stop.
Gates: Iran must take additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates declared the Tuesday that the great world powers will immediately impose "respective additional sanctions" on Iran because of its incapacity to engage in nuclear ambitions talking.
Gates, expressed before a part of 300 American soldiers in the north of Iraq, during a week's visit in the war zones in Afghan and Iraq, degraded the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, said, in response to the question of a soldier about the possibility of such a renewal.
One of the things I'm worse is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unprevisible side of war.
The Obama Administration considers a set of sanctions that would be the military and political election of Iran, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "all of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less good with nuclear weapons " because "health would suffer from these sanctions."
On Thursday, in a declaration of the White House's parliament, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if he does not bring its nuclear programme in full compliance with the United Nations Security Council and its Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful goal.
In Geneva's conversations on 1 October, he stated that it would reiterate the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and accept an important part of his enriched uranium stocking, in the unsuccessful exchange of fuel reactors for a medical research reactor.
The Administration has undertaken such agreements to develop a trust in both sides and to win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran seems to have been displaced with agreements - partly, they say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact that it is involved or not with the United States.
In fact, I think that the raisement of Iran faced some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually given their agreement at the beginning of October, the international community, including Russia and China, has made up to what they had not considered, in terms of significant sanctions against Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set on 31 December as a date limit to Iran to respond to proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what the State Secretary of Hillary Rodham Clinton had once called "augmented sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the United Nations mission declared what it called "for some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran" and said that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five other major world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington later Thursday, met the Irak Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the flight for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tension remains between the Kurdes and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially on borders, property rights and income share.
Gates urged the two parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all the delays of the United States plans to reduce the number of armed forces from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the concerns of the Kurdes regarding retreat in suspension. The American authorities called Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the regional government of Kurdistan: "We will keep your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq."
We will not leave you."
In older China, a direction change
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown around propaganda showing them: "The Mother's the earth is too sweet to welcome more children" and "A child more, it's a kid."
They learned so much that the government authorities of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the elderly population, had radically changed guidance in this year and began to encourage young couples to have more children; their reaction was immediately and strong: never.
We have already given our whole time and all our energy to a single child.
No second remains, said Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of single children notably with good games and grooms, exceeding the "peace of emperor", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate was decreased from 1.8 children by couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The dissemination of the population, while expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more will be explosed, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, which is over the global average of about 20 per cent.
This desequilibrium is still worse in the rich coastal cities with a very trained population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old people represented nearly 22 percent of the population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municipal Municipal population of Shanghai and the Family Planning Commission) said that the fertile couples should have babys to "to help reduce the proportion of the elderly population and to prevent the lack of work for the future".
Shanghai is on the point of become "the old, but not too rich, but - that the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," said.
Progressive attention
Under the Constitution of the country in 1978, Chinese single child policy is now without contest the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Parents who transgress this policy may have to pay collective amendments, up to three times their annual income, and to undermine discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of human rights denied abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to embrace.
Furthermore, many couples have requiring selective advertisements leading to a ratio of boys - girls normally high.
In recent years, the population responsible authorities have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rules, including for city residents, ethnic minorities, and the cases in which men and women are already single children, and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Peking, said that central government authorities recently discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to start a aggressive campaign to encourage births.
Nevertheless, the posters urged the families to have only one child have been replaced by copy of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the request of authorisation.
The city's government was deployed by members of the family planning and volunteers to meet pairs at their home, and put prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to family planning, the response was deceived.
Annual reply
While the responsibilities in a rural town of Shanghai's bathroom said they saw an increase in the requests of couple files wishing a second child after the campaign started, the urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huanan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, has only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's responsibilities, argued that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, it is still expected to be about 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai Common Caolu, stated that financial considerations may be the main reason for which many people do not want to have more children.
They want to make their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27-year-old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26-year-old, declared that they would worship two children and that they were legally authorized.
But as many Chineses, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say that the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerns consider that single child policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
That's true, we want the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
That's the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons for explaining their hesitation.
Wang, Responsable of Human Resources, said she wanted only a single child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit that everyone cares about us."
We don't have the habit of take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Siian, 42 years of owner of a translation company, says creatively.
For couples working at two, a medium-class, which make down the birth rate, it is said, it must be egoistic for success.
The people of 20 or 30 years grown by seeing their parents struggle in the first time of China capitalist, and they do not want to have their own life style, said he.
Even a single child asks for a lot of time of his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are prepared for this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has projects to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, sponsorized until now by disorganized affections and mutual recruitments, was returned under the fires of the Tuesday Chamber, due to the publication of a document that emphasizes the ambitious reductions of gas to shut over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that spend most of the burdens in the next time.
The text that could provide the basiss of a final political agreement to regulate the gases on the steel has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as it cleared the way to take.
But it was seen as an important advance in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders reaching the next week in Copenhagen.
Edited by a United Nations Special Working Group, the text does not say how rich countries would give poor to support climate, current and long-term warming.
It offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and the new emergencies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the higher limit of global temperatures that the responsible members would be ready to to tolerate.
He gives a great flexibility to the process, said John Coequy, representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, studied a 180 page negotiation text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent to the levels of 1990, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
In addition, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent of 2050.
The European Union also renewed the negotiations, sale, promised to provide $3,6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, to support incentives and seeds, or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Thursday, the same verbal alterances have been produced, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States in climate negotiation, rejected any discussion that obliges the reduction of gas to be reduced by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts carried out by the main economies, if these were not financed by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration becomes more harder towards China than the Bush administration has been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Star, who regrets also that the text is not sufficient to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the American main negotiator, being lacking "good", was "extremely irresponsible" to say in the week that the United States would not financially help China to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trailers of the main world powers in play, defects appear both within the third world and between the industrial world and the emerging economy.
Currently, the battle is more related to the salvation of individual economys than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States, to take up their respective obligations while the poorest nations stress the fact that the two twenty-first-first countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate in Costa Rica, said that it was not surprised that the main powers were struggled to know who should be able to reduce the costs of the weighty gas, even though the vulnerable countries were more aggressive in their attempt to make the major employees responsible for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hero is developed, says Ulate, who is also advising about the climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put the pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Insulary Pets States meeting 43 members has prepared a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States had "mixed a political pressure on the complete political process", in part by which they are now unified and requested to emergency economies such as China and India, to act.
Debates became an urgent case, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve the majority of the problems in the case before government leaders reached an agreement.
High-level responsibilities, such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Ministror, have descended from their airplane and have been engaged in the Bella Center building to attend meetings in home-class and information conferences in order to make complaints that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of the assembly -- during which 13,000 people enter and release from the Congress palace every day -- the guitare-actors playing actors present night spectacles that are shocking countries that, according to them, are traced and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper instead of emails -- is a real challenge.
Intensity is only growing: almost all the important ministers are here and not later after Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for World Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights arrive.
In Britain the first train at 225 km/h will refine the Sunday syndrome
At 5:13, Monday morning, a sifflet switch will pass the night to report the start of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Great Britain.
The first large-speed bathroom of the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will take Ashford, in Kent, in London St. Pancras, which covers 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the board of the first Javelin banking train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will enable Great Britain to integrate an international fast and reliable train network and link the major Midlands, North and Scotia conurbs in London.
The lost small troops will become florest bathrooms, business travels will be very less long and the passenger of the aircraft and the train car will reduce the national carbon emissions while decreasing shipments on roads.
In theoretical theory, the three main political parties are adherent to this project.
But the ten billion books required to build a new fertile network, inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers are risking to shut the British lines with great speed.
According to The Times, High Speed 2 (HS2), a company created in January to achieve a performance report for the Government will make a document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow you to get a detailed map of the next step planned for the high speed network.
The new line connecting London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact can be discussed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final entry.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
Privileged options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two or near Birmingham, with a branch towards the west of the Peninsians to Manchester and the Scotia and another way to the northwest, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross the ecosystem.
"It seems to be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When it is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip of an current hour.
The proposals will be allowed to travel at 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest worldwide.
The initial track is designed to allow 400 meters of length and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 hours trains can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can welcome 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
As given space barriers, an existing shop will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks or not that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures means that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launchs the machine, the network must be built partly.
Railways will first be obliged to run out of high speed lines on the shifts in the north of Birmingham, keeping travel periods between London and Scotia over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passenger to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Contributors pay the payment of 75,000 GBP for the Tory Heavy
Alan Duncan, the main member of the parliament of Tory, has paid thousands of books per year to repay the cost of a parentary that he has built in his house of his survey.
The responsibilities of the party that was retraduced by David Cameron for complaining that the members of the parliament were "income", increased its employee of 75,000 GBP to build an extension in his second house, in Rutland.
It was authorized to pay additional interests, as amounted to hundreds of books per month, to the contributory.
The Common Authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, which performed a control of the expenditure of members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, is owner of a house at two floors in a village of Rutland - Melton.
Avoining houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The remnant includes a kitchen, a salon and a room to eat, but the Emolutions Bureau states that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a verranda to the house, describing it in his plans as a parentary.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for joy".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to explain the increase in payment during a recent investigation made by the Common Privileges Committee and Standards on its pre-employment provisions.
The Committee innocent the last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation on its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the refund of 271.406 GBP from London to the house of his circumscription purchased in 1991, the year before it becomes a member of the Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1.400 GBP per month of payment interests until March of last year.
In April, his requests increased more than 800 GBP per month.
The interest rate of Mr Duncan RBS has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financed the employee of 75.000 GBP.
The standard RBS rate was 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without movement since then.
The last publication of the Common Authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1 250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post of the Fantastic Office in September, after a journalist under the cover, the filmed one declared that the members of the parliament had to survive on the budget after the expenditure scanning.
"In fact, now it's national, you must live on budget and you're treated as "of the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked a small part, based on what was right.
And I could ask more holyness, but I didn't do it."
The member of the Parliament, a million since his former post as negotiating in oil, began to explain its expenditure in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before being agreed with the cost office that "to be considered excessive".
A activist struck a £ in the skin of Mr Duncan to protest after he was revealed that he had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Question on the increase in the employee, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "This was for capital improvements, both approved by the Legg Office.
He added: " There is no problem of derogation or development or use of rules or anything else.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clean or simpler."
Fidels, all come here to see the calendar of the Brighton Event
Brighton's beach chains found a new way of promotion for winter months, an interactive event calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages the spiritual exploitation by creativeness, invited 24 owners to decorate their chain for each December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last chain from 17.30 to 18.30 a.m. every day, with free swimming and warm vineyards.
The songs of Christmas elected until now include "I Saw Thiree Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas," for which the chain presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, is an assistant in Hove's TV marketing assistant, a non-employed priest from Chichester's diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, why are we waiting for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captively.
"The idea of the calendar of the Avenue of the beach chain came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and living place and we try to experiment and represent this through spirituality."
Forte mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Decades of thousands of people have shown samedis to claim an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate heat through the world and Copenhagen, where the police has conducted several hundreds of interpellations.
At least thirty thousands, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people according to the organizations have deployed the cold in the Danish capital, at the margin of the United Nations Conference on the Climate, which was intended to purchase this year to an agreement enabled to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these manifestations, has contributed to make the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital were shortly after the cutting of the court, when a group of 300 manifesters, totally black clothes, slaughtered vitrines with shoes and martels, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-employed police are soon undertaken without household.
In total, the police announced the interruption of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolen groups that were particularly illustrated at the Nation Summit in Strasbourg, on the east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizations of the manifestation, declared the conditions in which hundreds of warriors were interplied, emphasized that a hundred of them " were always reserved in the Sabbath Street "menotted and maintained in position, despite the extreme cold".
Party of the Parliament, the courtage, instead of a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiation site.
The manifestants stopped around 500 meters of the building, without trying to rent it.
A scene was made to welcome the planned speakers, before a counterparty with the participation of the former South African Architec, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of manifestants came in because and in the large cities of Europe, but many Asians, some of the Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
About 3.000 people, for most impermeable sky blue, had formed a first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the friends of the Earth, who heard to form "Blue Mares" for the "justice for climate".
Today, we go to the streets to ask for reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a colonial warrior of the South Coalition Jubilee Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: We have a time, he estimated the blessed song of Angélica Kidjo.
There are rivers that sit in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the altermonismist movement approached environmental organizations.
The French deputy José Bové, the figure of the altermonalism, explained being come to Copenhagen for “the part of climate and social justice”: “There is no punishment between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world”.
The Asian-Pacific region, which opened many particularly vulnerable islands to heating, had given the cut of manifestations.
Some 500,000 people, according to the organizations, were descended in the streets in Australia.
In Manilla, a few hundreds of students of most people have discovered red, wooding bands from sun energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, assemblies of hundreds of manifestants were also held to claim energy action against climate change.
In France, the "350" network demonstrations gathered several hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (south), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
A few decades of people gathered together in Geneva.
Apartheid Abkhazie elected his President, Georgia claims a "face"
Abkhazie elected its President, a few more than one year after the recognition of Moscow of this separate region in Georgia, while Tbilissi claims a "face".
Some 131.000 were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of the Southern Ocean, another Georgian secesionist territory recognized by Russia.

In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia unlawfully occupied by Russian armed forces.
After being separated from Georgia at the conflict of 1992-1993, which has made several thousands of dead, Abkhazie is trying to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new age as an independent state, stated to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historical historian, who claimed to have voted to Mr Bagapch.
She was among the electors who came to the vote office in a school of Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palmyers before the entry.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the President in this region to subtle landscapes at the Black Sea.
Big Panx shown by Mr. Bagapch on the side of the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medveev and Vladimir Poutine, have been installed in this small territory of 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to supervise the execution of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, did he say during a small ceremony, in allusion for Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazie.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, putting up a vodka drink.

The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more a voice is needed to return the election.
If no candidate does this floor, a second tour must be organized in the two weeks.

The history is strengthened by the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luke Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD morning that history and geography were "reforcing" from the reform of the general school, despite the elimination of their obligatory education in scientific terminal.
Today, the first students will have every four-day hour and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "It must be out of hypocrisis" because, according to him, "the S filier is no longer a scientific subsidiary" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches can not remain subfilms of the S, continued by stressing: "I haven't heard many historicals and intellectuals to identify the absence of terminal geographic history in technological schools."
On Saturday, a Siop survey in Humanity revealed that nearly seven Frenchs on ten (69%) disappointed the government project to remove the binding education of the geographical history in terminal S. Many intellectual and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right elections.
Instead, the Minister added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (studys and trades) called on a mardi mobilization day to protest against the project, which offers the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an admissibility test that will bring on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will lead to their teaching ability, explained the Minister.
They will also follow stages in the M2 year then will be the first year before students as stage teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the competition, you already get more present before the students, or more than 300 hours, has it continued.
Finally, the Minister states that it will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also reaffirms the project to remove the school card since 2012.
A Normale Su, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Summit of Copenhagen: it was the challenge that John Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) was invited by the Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Prize of Peace, inaugured the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day constituted an enquiry of experts, 15 minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that touchs people and gives them more to know, explained in the margin of the Edouard Hannezo Conference, 22 years of age, one of the organizations of this day that took his name by the students to the fish of the school basin.
A twenty-five of intervenants are selected among the experts of their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, is it specific.
With regard to climate heating, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk to key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notices, but by using graphics, before 50 people.
This is part of our scientist role, he stressed, hoped that auditors will reiterate that "the Copenhagen Conference is supported in a extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be online on the school site from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned in February, followed by others to a bimestrial rythm.
Payment rates: angry of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisory unions called the "general mobilization" Friday to require the payment of the final year feasts and additional hours for which the payment was relocated in January for budget reasons.
FO-Petitionary (2th Unit of Oversights) requested staff who will not be able to manifest on Monday morning before the prison institutions and to "bloke them" to "declare the flight of their duties".
The CGT-Pententiary (Third of the Professional Syndicate) calls them to "join General Meeting in various prisons for strong mobilization", judgeing the "good and unacceptable" non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night prizes, Sundays and Feast Days" worked in October.
And the first trade of supervisors, the Federal Pennsylvania Autonomy Union (Ufap/Unsa), "he calls for general mobilization (...) to reverse the incontinent and wrath."
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explains that additional hours have increased in 2009 and not all been budgeted, but ensure that the recruitments will be paid in January.
The Chairman has explained at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the supervisors signs that ensure that this payment would be done in the next month.
I don't know the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this post.
I requested the direction of the Pensional administration to set up a set of measures to ensure that this situation born a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours is not reproduced in the future, added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The payment of December, therefore, will be large, except for senior officers benefiting from familities and objectives, has deployed Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary contractuals have a good deal".
This is a pure scandale, the interregional FO Union of Marseille, announcing its decision to tycotter until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
Personals will not come to work on their Sunday and holiday days if those of the October month are not regulated in December, they are for additional hours, and also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increased without increased our effectiveness, it is more regrettable to take it to the staff members, considers the Bordeaux CG.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less ill than others.

The husband, aged 30 years of age, was interrupted and was blessed.
The first two victims, griefly blessed, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenian succeeded.
The days of the other blessed are in danger, living organs are apparently touched, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a males and would have been hospitalized "in the state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the imprisonment of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then flee on the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He had been blessed two passengers, apparently at the shock: a thirteenth and a quadrant, this last grievely.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two shoes of shocks that he was taking behind the dust, explaining on place one responsible for the Alliance of the Alliance in the High-De-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several passing, such as young people, according to witnesses collected by the AFP, tried to control the force.
I saw a type of 30 years with a green clothes.
Three young people tried to intercepte it.

U.S.: Polanski's lawyer recalled him again
The lawyer of the French-Polygonian cinema Roman Polanski replied once again in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), abandoning his client's continues, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a death case over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", announced three judges of the second district of California of serious procedures at the time of the fact, in 1977.
I claim to abandon the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "fryed in the dust."
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- deceived since -- had discussed, before he was sentenced, with a lawyer who had told him that Roman Polanski had granted the prison -- which is a serious prosecution.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from the mouth of the lawyer, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally stated that until September he had "menses" to the documentary author.
In the case of the court refused to abandon the continuation, Mr. Hummel recalled the holding of a proceeding, which would enable him to submit the evidence of his argumentary.
The accused reiterates the argument already developed in the first place, namely that no leaves of charge could be seriously studied as long as Roman Polanski would not be present before the court.
The cinema, 76 years old, was gone from the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illicual sexual relations" with a less than 13 years of age.
He never sent his feet to the United States since.
The advisor of Los Angeles' committee, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "dot be there to be a hearing."
In this case, would you like to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones, is it possible to leave), Mrs. Asyama.
For her, the cinema "deserves a favor to the court, while lacking his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make their decision, also stressed "what there were other alternatives to flee."
Mr. Hummel wasn't the only one to ask for an abandonment against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also recalled her, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Remembering that his client does not support being shocked at any rebonding of the Polanski case, she added: "Another one in this room can say that the procedure was just.
30-2 years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his gstaad chalet, waiting for an eventual extradition.

The Extensive Standard & Poor Index 500 has progressed 0.37% (4,06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honourously, the market is very calm, Mace viewsilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close margins, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "contributed to improve the market's view on the solidarity of economic recovery", resumed Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, detail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month of shipment and much more than planned.
The confidence of American consumers was also clearly resolved in December, at 73.4 to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimation of the Michigan University Index.
Indexes, however, have been freed by a new progress of the dollar, the most higher than two months before the euro, which "possess the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Germany.
Technological values thus lost the field.
The compulsory market slowed.
The benefit of the Tresor to 10 years has progressed in 3,540% against 3,482% Monday night and the good to 30 years of age to 4,497% against 4,492%.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of perplexing through South Africa, the 112 candidates under Miss Monde learned to franchise the last right line to achieve their dreams: be the most beautiful woman of the world before a billion television.
During this large measuring of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already decreased their ticket for half-final.
Mrs. Japon Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta del Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kayane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected sportive Miss or even the top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap, it was extraordinary.
I saw all things and lived so many experiences!, Mrs. Sierra Leone explains.
This competition, which takes place for the nineth time in South Africa, is transferred from Midrand to the north of Johannesburg from 17.00 hours (15.00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my coron.
This experience was fascinating.
I am glad to have lived it twice, Mrs. Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of Australian summer.
For the young Russian, his second residence in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and the "recovering landscapes to cut the souffle in this country".
After a month of galaxy, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, all of the two stars of Bollywood.
It's the dream of every woman to be the most beautiful coronated in the world, but it's not just the appearance.
We are the embassy of our country and I want to go home with the king, launching Mrs. India with a great mourn.
According to the organizations, music and dance will point this 59th edition.
The candidates will be deployed in traditional and obviously in bathroom mail.
The spectacle will be affected by a TV presentator, China Angela Chow, the former South African beauty race Michelle McLean and a responsible member of Mrs. Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that she was able to welcome the world with a warm and pride that it's hard to equality, assured Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates made a safari last year, visited the famous Soweto cityship, but this time at ice, and enjoyed the local kitchen.
In exception, they also met the South African President Jacob Zuma who shuted their hands.
No use for a head of State, Mrs. Sierra Leone.
Their earliest memories will certainly remain the seat in the Cap (south-west) for the Football World Coupe of June 2010, a way to promote the country a little more event.
I've been friendly with people I never thought I could never approach.
I will, without doubt, return to the World-2010 Worldwide, encouraging Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is very positive, according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assured her son David's sell in his arrival to the Los Angeles airport where he had to get to his hospitalized father for a few days.
News are very positive.
It's very strong, it's very good, stated to the David Hallyday press at his outcome from the flight that brought it from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The son of the songer, the detention, assured that he would become "speak" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was acknowledged for a consecutive infection in the operation of a discreet heritage in Paris on November 26.
The songer was "played in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort to prevent her suffering and to control her treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinaai de Los Angeles, where he was administered for a consecutive infection in the operation of a discreet heritage in Paris on November 26.
The songer had to be reopened on Thursday night because of important lessons resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning at the French school of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade was taught to attend a school spectacle, found an AFP photo.
The orthopedic and traumatic Chief of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpereere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would take the lunch in Los Angeles at the channel.
The producer was violently investigated by Dr. Stefane Delajoux, the neurochirurgic who operated the songer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We said that it was a mask.
Los Angeles surgery said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, does it say.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "a lot too fast part for Los Angeles, with the authorisation of Parisian surgery."
I had this online doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was awesome, since I had two discrepancies, he added me.
Before previously on RTL, he said that the songer was apparently "free part, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actor Mary Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actor Charlotte Gainsburg to resort a hematom following a cerebral hemorragia.
But it is also a doctor for the surfurous reputation, sentenced several times by justice, in medical responsibility dossiers, as well as for fiscal and scroquency fraud.
Me Olivia Metzner, the lawyer of the Medicine's order, accused of being a "unclean man" continued "regularly" before the Council of Order, which is "recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stefane Delajoux expressed himself on Thursday by his lawyer Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "facely well launched" and that post-operatory reviews were "normal".
The operation "it was not hemorragical and therefore did not need the place of a drain", he added.
In any case, the twice of the songer, whose health injuries are multiplied since this year, seems to be between pairs.
Of course, a reprise of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the ton and sums the New Centre to do not use its sell
The UDF association, controlled by the Modem de François Bayrou, reacted on Friday at the trial of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seat of the former russian party, still put it on any support, under the punishment of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention of recovering the UDF class, judged that François Bayrou was not worth defending his political heritage after he had brought his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party was partner of the UNPU, was also planned to confirm this strategy at the CN National Council.
To support his outcome, he received the support of Mrs Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP previously) who returned the UDF mark's property to have been the first in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Properties.
But on Thursday night, the UDF Association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou, who do not hear to be owned, was out of his silence to launch a residence to the Minister and the Deputy, who summoned them to use it and to send them to the mark's property, under the punishment of judiciary continuations.
You have multiplied, these last days, the statements indicated that you go to propose your political movement of +reprendre+ the UDF, wrote the association in a mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarness du MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Century Alliance.
You have also believed to follow your military material and your website's maintenance page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today, also found the email signatures.
As you don't know it, you have no right to use this chapter, explaining the UDF office that still allows the NC to "immediately remove the name of the UDF name of any support and (son) website".
He also requests Hervé de Charette "to submit the property of it marks to his legal laws".
If you do not, the courts would be imposed to comply with the law and the legal rights of UDF adherents.
In their email, they explain that UDF is a political movement since 1978, and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends had made the choice to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UNP."
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF set (the Union for the French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF meeting in 2007 voted its membership to Modem for three years and the establishment of a office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valery Giscard of Esteing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continued to the office, "when he put the mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years," but to the UNP.
It benefits scandalously and fraudly from the UDF acronym absence for its account.
This indelicateness is being transformed in crime, and they are denied, before Ironing on the CN strategy: "It seems that in policy, as in life, it is more honourable to make a name by itself than trying to get out of the anonymate by fraudly taking a name to which you do not have a right."

This decision means that there will be a process in this case of a saga on one of the most rich families in France, in which mother and daughters were able to hold the rays of cosmetics L'Oreal.
But the 15th correction room also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegely by three doctors.
The main heritage and shareholder of the Oreal has always refused to submit to such consideration, in any case in the conditions proposed by the Nantere Park during the investigation.
Dr. named doctors should report before 10 March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt had been found in a state of weakness and at which periods.
I think she's gonna put it up.
I'm going to talk to him, told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the Court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (M. Barnier) managed this old lady that we must protect, has it declared.
Since two years, Liliane Bettencourt's unique daughter has engaged in criminal persecution against François-Marie Barnier, photographer and artist, all of which she accused of having benefited for years of lowness of her mother to obtain a billion euros of gifts in the form of Cheques, insurance contracts or insurance tables.
On the side, Liliane Bettencourt has always reaffirmed having been handled by the photo that she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidories sometimes turned to the large family depackation on Thursday.
As a result, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she meant the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 email, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "To explain my daughter I wrote to Barnier once, two times a day for 15 years.
Francoise, I never could talk to him since his marriage."
For its part, Nanterre's park reiterated that the complainant was not acceptable to act, so much more than a judge of the torch has rejected the past few days to make the right to his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full ability to act in justice, it is not protected and has no tutor.
Nobody else has to act on his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Mary-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would be pronounced once the prosecution had been done on the receipt of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managemental revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence would have been just...
For over a decade of years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises in respect of its employees, recalls the position of consumers before marketing revolution: it is to adhere the "valers" workers to be determined above as it was once, to impos the consumers of the products thought by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer in the company's heart, marketing revolution has delivered marketing strategies to the site, although the authorisation attempt to imposing disconnected products from customer preference factors regularly re-established!
Democracy of employees may deplore on mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the most general part of a phenomenon that touchs the frameworks in particular.
This demobilization is seriously compromising the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE requires "to all stakeholders (...) a proactive exchange and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment to the employee's income of authorisation management.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be to put collaborators in the company's centre on the same basis as the customer.
All relative use of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees, will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I was able to find that, faced with a new situation, any structure comes finally, after a lot of distances, to make priority... what she has always done!
- Then, because authorism – one of the pathologies of the power believes proportionally to the importance of his own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
They have a mechanical interpretation of psychology from the major engineering schools.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old theory of behaviorist, recently reacted by the "neurosciences" states and widely distributed states, at their injury, by the study institutions and the media.
Thus, suggesting that the "leviers" (sic) of the framework commitment is possible, a recent investigation of Ipsos referred to in Le Figaro.fr is conforted by the leaders in a mechanical governance post inadequate to the world of today.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper operation of modern enterprises is to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental consciousness: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a way to achieve a part of their dreams, ambitions and their projects.
Today, only the studies carried out by the motive analysis adopted this design of the motivations of employees.
These studies showed that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxe that allows them, through their projects of the company, to evaluate what it provides for them to achieve their live projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, prevent, and anticipate their "social performance" and provide their management of human resources "towards".
They thus set up a favorable field for the development concerted with a robust and effective economic intellectuality.
Oslo Discursors: "just war" values loans to the right in Obama
The United States' law welcomed Tuesday the old speech in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfying that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The conservators, who had broken the price assignment to Mr. Obama on October 9, adopted the presidential talk at the board of Sarah Palin, the former candidate to the Vice-President in 2008.
I loved what he said, Mrs. Palin, Egypt of the right side of the Republican Party, at the U.S. daily newspaper today, adding to herself to the theme of the "also necessary" war in his memories that have come to be published.
The war is clearly hearing my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists should be stopped around there, it was estimated.
Mr. Obama, whoher two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afganistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afganistan for nine days later.
Another adverse from Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the President had done in Oslo "the very good job".
I found that the speech was very good, and he welcomed the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, which particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the Presidential proposal.
On some side, I found this very historic conversation, Mr. Gingrich, interviewed at the radiophonic "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a candidate to the Republican Investment for the Presidential election of 2012, was glad to have seen "a President of the left" to remind Nobel Committee members "what they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if there was no force".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush's cronic converter at Washington Post, Mr. Obama announced "a very American talk."
In addition to presenting themselves in "the world citizens" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American President," reminding the Europeans "what they live in a squad that they have not created and that they do not make great things to keep it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare right to be not convinced, a faucon of Bush, the former embassy at the United Nations John Bolton, has qualified the discours of "thene, appealed, and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich warned to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is supported in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the mass of innocents, has he been guarded.
However, the left center press remained awesome in the direction of the President.
The Los Angeles Times continued to think that the Nobel was prematurely assigned to Mr. Obama, qualified its allocation of "Super Production" even for a known speaker for his talent.
The speaker of Oslo should serve a road sheet to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression, and the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech that he had to do", estimated the New York Times, judged him "the dark and constructing times".
Rounds: three marathons for an agreement to save Christmas supply
After three negotiations of marihuana, the trade and TLF trade unions, the only patronal organization to be stayed until the end, arrived on Thursday night at an agreement that ends the word of grief and the threat to Christmas supply.
At the signing meeting on Thursday night, the State Secretariat at the transport, Dominic Bussereau, was "joyed" of this agreement, after several negotiations taken on Wednesday morning.
After a second discussion night, the negotiators left on Friday morning, with the hope of signing rapidly at the end of the morning the text of the agreement.
And that's the same if three patronal organizations (FNTR, Onestra, OTRE) had closed the door.
But more than six hours of a meeting started at 11.00 p.m. to ensure that everyone agrees and that the text was signed at 18.00 p.m.
The conflict "it would have been very harmful for the companies" and "he was afraid that he came to break the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text prescribes an increase of 4% wages for the lower wages (of local and regional road transports), and of 2,9% for higher (international transports).
Time rates, for bass salaries, " goes from 8,72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a great thing, but from far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
This will be ordered to our militarys that there is no blocks, no blocks of raviation centres.
But there may always be some recalcants that are not satisfied, he added.
Philippe Grillot, Chairman of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement," even though he was "facile to consume high wages on high salary accounting for international competition".
According to him, increases will be of the monthly EUR 170 for low payments and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of the good sense and respect of the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the revaluement of the movement costs of 3 per cent and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective Convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros of patronal charges" was subject to a Government amendment to the draft corrective financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will request the Senate to vote "in the same term".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first time to enterprises associated with this organization, and in second time, to the whole professional, in case of extendion by the Minister of Work.
She will be "in the shortest terms", assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of patronal organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR declared a "dupes market", as the 100 million euros were already promised in the sector to compensate a part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of the Transports has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but to do not contrary the dinner dinners of the next revejoon, the Unostra deplored.
For the other, the agreement may "decrease the throat of a very large number of sector PME in the next 12 months".
RER A: disorders this weekend, miscontinent signs of the RATP proposals
The distress on RER A, the largest urban transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Thursday on Thursday, on Thursday, between trade unions and headquarters of the RATP left them on their hunger as regards their prize request.
Thursday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchase before Christmas, there will be only trains between 10:00 and 20:00, due to a train on two on the central throne (inter Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central throne.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galeries, who are waiting for 200,000 customers every day, have joyed the fact that "RATP is doing efforts to preserve the big shops".
RER A crosses west and is Paris's aglomation.
The short RATP throne of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Sint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Wednesday, about a two-hour train rounded at the point hours, and almost no branch in cross-hour, as was expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cows on which the French people were organized.
As soon as a small morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than a computer, in particular because of the absence of college and licenses.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that it was "a thirty-first hour later to be sure to arrive at the time".
The St. Lazare garage didn't know of saturation, stated the SNCF, who had planned a framework for agents and order forces.
The RER A operated from the SNCF or to Cergiy-Le-Haut arrived or leaved from the Saint-Lazare car to reach the metros.
New grade gatherings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results of "maigres" by the trade unions, of a meeting with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the EEA proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, carriage, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, which claims a dual prize, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also put its first proposals between parents, smiling the CGT, emphasized that the direction "is not able to resolve a problem while the roads and the SNCF are done".
A new meeting is planned for "a broader review of the terms of professional exercise", stated the RATP.
What has also been said to the unions that the company "floored users of the weekend."
On the morning, some 150 drivers had entered a seat committee in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which rejected until values of any discussion during the green, suggested "in a matter of disappointment" the meeting.
The conflict is threatening to expand the CER B on March after a predicted Unsa and Independents.
The trade unions request a price of 120 euros (unsa) to 150 euros, with 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and degrading the working conditions on this line at a million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of carriage, touched from 2.200 to 2.700 euros, as well as 600 to 650 euros of premises, for discalled days, Sundays and Days.
Turkey's justice dismisses the Procured Party, a serious decision of consequences
The Turk Constitutional Court announced the conclusion of the main pro-courde party of the country, a decision which was immediately followed by manifestations of angry in the Curde Community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is risking to greatly compromise the task of the Government, which has come towards the curde community to try to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was deleted because it became a "hour of prejudice to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", stated the President of the Hasim Kiliç Court at the end of four days of delegation.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dilution, Mr. Kiliç said that 37 of the frameworks of the party, including President Ahmet Turk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the wage of the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Turk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Party's Trust.
The PSC has 21 seats in Parliament (up to 550).
His leaders had warned that the Members would leave Parliament instead of settler as an unlabeled parliamentary.
The decision is followed by a procedure laid down in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Abdulrahman Yaliginkya Cassation Court, which condemns the DTP to obtain the "directions" of the "directors" of the Khrupistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal vitrine of PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "non organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify the terrorist organization and calls upon the Government to negotiate with him.
The Court ' s greenness is at the time that the Government has made the hand to the Curde community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to support the KKK ' s Curdes and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a dilution could lead to the recruitment of tensions in the Southern Anatolian, where many manifestations against the conditions of detention of the head of PKK Abdullah Öcalan have been decreased in striking with the police in recent weeks.
Since the advertisement of justice, a thousand manifestants gathered before the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the large cities of the south-east in most Kurdes.
The order forces took lacrymogen grenades and used water canons, while manifestants launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frozens.
A hundred people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk said that the decision of justice would "develop desires".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (courde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, said to the press.
The Government, formed by an Islamic Moving Party, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not resolve anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Ylichz.
This decision is a total torment of democratic opening launched by the government, commented by the Ahmet Island political analysis.
Of course, a reaction of the PKK was added.
Thursday, the PKK recovered a attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in the north of Turkey, one of the most killers of the last months.
The first necks may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants, it's a strict winter.
However, the responsibilities of the road destroy and sampling services (FES) are specific, although it is not to embarrass citizens.
It's just that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to control them well.
And according to meteorologists, it could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack nest and swimming.
The EES is following a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that while he was declining on the city of Francfort and the temperatures fall down under zero, large sampling vehicles were ranging 20 main items (named 'A') .
This includes large circulation streets, main arteries, such as the New path and Hanauer Landstraße.
They also include powder access, common transport itinerary, pieton zones and pitting streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three hours of morning.
In the case of need, the 1040 kilometres of swimming pool must be slowed with a road founder that adheres, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is the reason why the FES service begins at 3 p.m. "to the roads are displaced when the traffic of daily migration begins".
There or that becomes harder, it's when the nest starts to fall at 7:30 of the morning.
This poses problems, says the responsibilities of the road switch and switch service "for no automobilist is ready to pass the salary vehicles".
Then, if it no longer shouts, we take care of the access routes and switches - such as the Beil-Straße Council.
The secondary ways and the late streets are finally coming.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this is always a few complaints.
At five hours of the morning, the FES Pedestrian team is on the way to take priority to the dangerous areas and passages.
In terms of cyclable pistes, the FES services are generally not able to take care of it.
Mr. Brauburger explains that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 and 4 p.m.
As the wheels are very rapidly formed on these surfaces, salary vehicles are interacted as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police also calls for this special service in need.
The beast of the dinosaures
The Tawa hallae was similar to other meat dinosaurs: this bipede would measure about 2 meters long for 1.50 m from high, his poster members were powerful, his long-term clan was slowed and recovered, his short arms ended by fat and had a long shoe.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing to be exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Sunday Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaures of these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made part of the lands emerging from the supercontinent, the Pangee and turned to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa will shine a new day the evolution of the first dinosaures.
Indeed, it refers to the parent's links, the distribution and the characteristics of these.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertakes with other Palestinians, on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the team of fouls tells them that there was sometimes a twenty-five oxen in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary kitchen dating from Trias.
Scientists were very rapidly understood that a part of these osses belonged to a new species.
The crews updated the remaining of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginning of the dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized him from the name of Tawa, according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the God of the Sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary discovery: the dinosaurs from Trias are extremely rare and limit to some fragments of oss incomplete.
All Paleonology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is specially spectacular, but it makes it possible to confirm some theories about the beginning of the dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaures appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete what makes very difficult the classification of all the first dinosaurs.
The experts are interviewed between the time when the Saurians have been divided into three major evolution groups: the theropodes (carnivors) which include tironsure and velociraptors later appearing and whose birds, sauropodes, quartopides along the cow, and those who are appearing to them and the ornithic herbbles of which are part of the species such as torratops and stegoseure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of characteristics both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indexes that let the Tawa hallae have small air sacks at its clan level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the thermopodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the greens were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest thermopods presenting small air sacs in his oss.
As the apparent line of large sauropodes also had air sacs and a light ossure, they may be thought that their common older had already a profitable innovation.
Three next migration vagues to North America.
As the most known primitive dinosaures lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians were appearing there.
Thus, the three large lines of evolution were divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world is to say the whole land that formed the supercontinent Pangee.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Paleonologist team has also found the remaining of two other thermopods that are not particularly apparent to him.
The three species may not fall from a common ancilla that had been mixed, advanced researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Natural History Museum and Coautor of the Journal of Science Studies said there were at least three migration vagues to North America.
We have heard some contradictions.
Martin Sander, Palestinian Palestinian in Bonn, says that there is an older species, the silesaure, who lived in the current Poland and belongs to a group appearing to dinosaures.
According to him, this could be a mistaken vision because in South America there is a large number of dinosaures fossiles that have been preserved while there are almost nothing on other continents.
On the contrary, how the dinosaures have been able to become the dominant tetnudes of the secondary era, while they were from a relatively rare colonial line of the retreats branch, still a mystery today.
In the Trias’s day, the dinosaures shared their habitat with many other retreats, such as the ancients of the current crocodiles and many other saurians.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaures disappeared throughout the planet so that the development of many new species, while others, who were appearing to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurasic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander see two hypothesis.
There could be a massive extinction to which the dinosaures have survived in an alertive manner while other retreats would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaures were better adapted, and therefore they could eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the decline of a favorite meteorite of a group of animals, which was also developed during the Trias, which has been shocked in the darkness.
Vienna's solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signaries of the whole world.
There are those of Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna or Berkeley University in California.
There are course charges from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edimburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the casino police of University J.W. Goethe de Francfort makes vagina on the whole planet.
278 Professors and teachers from University J.W. Goethe, but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the protesters of the Western Campus.
In a German and English statement they condemn the police intervention claimed by the Director Committee of university.
Last week, the President of the Werner Muller-Estler University had made evacuation of the buildings occupied by students and teachers in greve after graffiti walls and works.
Five students were blessed during the evacuation.
Signaturers believe that degradations did not justify "a very violent intervention from the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable achievement" to the freedom of research and education.
The fact of focusing solely attention on the acts of vandalism is only to "delegitimate and criminalize protest" and try to forget the reasons of mobilization.
Thus, the Director of the university Committee underlined discussions that would, however, be essential.
Scientific loads require immediate suspension of committees.
Most employees did not participate in degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The Teenagers of the Verdi Services Sector and the German Syndicates Confederation (DGB) Syndicates are solidary students.
Protections are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretariat for youth in the trade of Verdi.
As regards the Minister of Sciences of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), it took and caused the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, it was said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday at the television issue.
We understand the sense of protest, but we do not accept the vandalism, expressed the Deputy CDU of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the left (the left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few penturlular walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting the arguments and returns of students, they are evacuated.
The Left has made a movement to the Minister of Interior to report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she was the reputation of secret city, prohibited Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the soviet regime, a place to seek secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the Common Reputation is to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
The importance of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are placed there.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, the place of French sciences – with the university institutions and the innovation centre of Francfort (FIZ).
There were recital and late meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg, who ratified a “the close cooperation protocol.”
The signaries were the Moscow Vice-Women Juri Rossljak and the Anatoly Smimou of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Project Section Chief for Francfort.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and PME, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Instead, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutions and institutions.
There is the Institute of Moscow Electronics, the large Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as "socialist villa" for arms research.
Zelenograd (litteral "Greens" translation) takes his name of the collines covered in the heart of which the research centres are implanted.
S21 project: a free for Stuttgart
Stuttgart 21 project is not sufficiently high.
For his parties, it's just "new heart of Europe".
If we want it. S21, it's much more than the exhibition of a rail garage, more than a colossal construction project that will extend the heart of the Bade-Wurtermberg capital, in a deceased chaos of chain for a decade of years.
Stuttgart 21 is born from the spirit of the 80s.
The line heads, with ways that ended in the city, were the reputation at the time to be the churches of the transport technique of the 19th century, which had been effected by modern rail fresh sabote because it had to be a lot of time to pass back to the front.
Stop, stop, go – that's what we need to do.
That's why the line head cars have to disappear: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train passenger, which is at mid-chemin around the Trans-European Weather Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "Europe's Court".
The realization of the S21 project will really start, although the visions of the 80s are not yet compatible with the reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to swallow the car in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière, was exorbiting.
Actually, the line head cars do not really possibly pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains that are reversible with authors and pilot cars to both extremities.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now started next to the new track of the interface line to Ulm.
Regional and common policies have introduced it.
The iron road company is from the part because it is the contributory that makes risk costs of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic, not public undertakings.
From urbanism, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that – if it is believed in the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
S21 is nervous for the rail transport system.
The transition guard and the expansion of the section are designed for a trafficking of persons assigned - and it is typical for the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition of good market flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of goods traffic because rail transport is much more respectable than road vehicles.
But the new trace, with his inclinations, does not correspond to goods trains.
S21, and this is much more seriously related to other rail projects indirectly.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Suabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade, this money will miss for other points of joining and enforcement in the network.
The list of the Department of Transports mentions in any sixty major projects.
One of the most important ones is the expansion of the section through the Rhin Valley of 180 nine kilometers.
Since 1987, this line is built at the random.
It would be really urgent to support here on the champion.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a shipping sabot.
The Rhin Valley's entry into the way to become the extreme routine of international goods, and it is in full heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the sentence made on the airport
In the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the country called for the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court on the prohibition of night aircraft.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDD/FDP coalition was responsible for reviewing the judgment made by the Administrative Court and that is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Cassel Court had justified in a written document that the country should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project of construction of the Northwest Aeroport station of Francfort Airport would be achieved.
The authorisation to arriv at 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as the country's government considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night aircraft.
The coalition should have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make a cassation in the case against the sentence made.
The critical opposition of this period and tries to press the representative of the Government so that the circumcision would be sent to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel invited the CDP and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections, which was to ban the night flights.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his words, said the chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir Verts by making allusion to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch reaffirms the claims of Schäfer-Gumbel who claims that the Government of the country is trying to authorize even the night flights by using "the lawyer and robbery."
We need time to conduct a specific legal examination.
Coalition does not want to decide on the basis of a "first rapid impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Muller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely enhanced.
American banks repay the granted aid
The large American banks, which are very touched by the crisis, are developed from their link to the State.
The Bank of America announced merry that it had fully paid $45 billion to the Treasury (more 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Safety Plan.
The CNBC American TV chain reported that Citigroup also intended to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions thus seek to dismiss taxed restrictions, which comply with the acceptance of services, such as the limitation of the good assigned to the leaders and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase in the sale of titles to investors who reported to it $19 billion.
The rest of the sum provides boxes of the bank which are well filled with the sale of several other sectors.
Mercredi last night, Kenneth Lewis, Director-General of the Bank of America, had expressly grateful for the US contributions: the capital injection was significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had summarized its capacity by purchasing the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank as the most strongest of the financial tour.
The Citi-Gruppe also intends to provide money on financial markets in order to be free of the entire State.
The US bank could thus start a capital increase of $20 billion since Thursday, reported the CNBC chain quoting bank environments.
The Citi Group's talking port did not want to comment this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had paid the public funds they benefited.
Acceleed election
Finally, everything happened even soon than planned.
Only two weeks after the removing of the current post of head-in-Chair Nikolus Brender by the German Administration Board of Chain ZDF, the poster is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote last night for the appointment.
Peter Frey, who directs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the great favorite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote to not anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the will of not exceeding the intelligence of the ZDF Markus Schacher in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Administration Council.
Frey, who was the candidate of Schacher, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known to the closure of the edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed the Governing Council to extend the contract of Nikolus Brender for five years, but that was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council were favourable to Brender's recovery and other seven had voted against.
Indeed, the CDU that is major to the Governing Council has already heard several weeks before the vote has been voted, did not want Brender to reduce Brender at its post.
This is Roland Koch, the President of the Hesse Land, who had organized a link against the head editor.
He refused that the contract of the very head-editor would be extended by calling that the rate of listening to ZDF information emissions had decreased under Brender.
This is the reason why protests were still, nearly until the vote, shutting the growing political influence on ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public experts who were employed in the debate and estimated that Koch's way of acting was anti-constitutional.
But it won't serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the political sciences, the pedagogy and the Roman languages (Spain).
He then worked at the Southwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinat radioorgany) and Frankfurter Rundstein (German National Porte Day).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in the newspaper "hour-journal" (day newspaper).
Then his trip continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was the member of the head editor of the era; then, in Washington in 1991/1992, he was head and presented by the "Morgenmagazins" (the morning submitted); until 2001, he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF, then head of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's disgrace, while it just came to be journalist of the year by the specialized Medium Magazine magazine, the Verts announced that they would have a constitutional complaint.
Coch's advisor to the Governing Council, the President-President of Rhenania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty in order to not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider to ask for the retirement of the political personalities of the CDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, likely Brender's poster, had been able to handle with the Administration Council by criticating the Committee with verily in its decision to remote Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor in the head without losing the face, as well as the Administration Council could elect it without the suspicion of posting a political party.
In the aritmical representations of the parties, Frey is left free classified.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs in the country decided to show a more conciliation: at a meeting between the Ministers and the Delegates of the Rector Conference, a agreement was made on the point that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to be able to get out of their studies.
In particular, they agreed to raise the weight of the reviews: a single review should allow to closure the selected study module.
Furthermore, workload should be reviewed in order to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of reviews between universities and foreigners.
Countries also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level there must not be different regulations from one country to another.
Mining of reviews
Since the beginning of the study protests in June, the Ministers of Education of Countries and universities have stopped speaking to the mode: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to considerably reduce the number of reviews: "Each module must normally be concluded by a single review," may be read in a document of thirty-six pages on the future conditions of accession to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that, by slowly reducing the load of reviews, the delays should be able to stop, which were considerablely disadvantaged for the study.
Studyability should be overwhelming in the future the decisive criteria of the study organization.
The modules as the background must be carefully reviewed to see whether this feeling of shocking is not able to avoid sometimes in the course choice.
Hambourg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) is delegated inflicted.
Students should "have the possibility and handling necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will apply access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies on the entire federal territory which depend on the accreditation advice established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had spent a certain pressure on countries so that they should be on the agencies so that the programmes are not too strict and the review regime are not too strict.
In some countries, universities and higher schools have already been heard with their regional ministers to take appropriate measures.
Rhenenia-Palatinat is until now the only country to have given its agreement to provide more means for the development of the Bologne process.
With these funds, universities must organize tourism programmes to strengthen the Pedagogical Orientation Offices, as well as review offices and international relations services
Countries and universities prescribe a budget of EUR 10 million.
Starting 2010, the Government wished to put Parliament an amendment to the Legislative on Higher Education institutions.
Following this, only one review should be carried out to closure its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, moreover, it must be able to ensure the recognition of the notes of other higher education institutions and the access to the Master must be simplified.
From the end of the next year, the "studie" of all university cycles will be reviewed.
On Thursday, the Government and the opposition again discussed the issue of studies conditions in the country.
The decisions have been appreciated but critical have been heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that it would like the organization of educational policy to go back to the future "Close doors" of Ministers and universities advisers.
After the educational grade, students should be able to express a little.
The future diplomates of higher education are received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of Countries with which the HRK works on a common reform project.
For the Syndicat of Education and Sciences (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn will not be enough. He claims the right and possibility for each Bachelor deplored to register to a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the CEW Directorate Committee also requests that countries ensure the students of Bachelor today, that there will be enough places for Master studys and the conditions of study as well as possible.
Countries, therefore, have to build more course loads.
Instead, the Ministers of Education did not suggest the possibility of extending access to the Master.
More than one page note on Herta Müller
It's through these words “Arrivée in Germany and it's almost more control...” that begins a work of the Poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost his language territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucarest and, afterward, director of collection in a house of edition for youth before installing Francfort on Main.
Söllner received several literature prices; in 1993 he had the very convocated meat from the Goethe University of Francfort and since 2002 he was director of Hesse's literature forum at the Mousonturm's artist house in Francfort.
He had much talked about him in non-literarian circles last Wednesday, at a Congress in Munich, which was the theme "The German literature in Romania in the look and the deforming look of your Securitate dossiers".
Visiblely destabilized and gentle, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged his German-Roman writers as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer who had cooperated as an informant for the Security Political Policy.
Söllner received the price of the German language together with some of the participants in 1989.
Experience tests had been initially started in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "So someone who has not enough to resist trials of intimidation of the Security."
The Poet Werner Söllner is Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel price for Herta Muller and its exemplary literaries with the dictatorship mechanisms, the literary scene is broken and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abuses and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and shocking.
Werner Söllner is, as it can be said according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, ensures the literature specialist Michael Markel after the condemnation of Söllner and returns to the positive impact of IM Walter who had interfered in his favor.
"He could take him out of all the difficult situations at the time," said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement, and before this public was unexpected, but he has had a former dissident of his collaboration with Roman secret services is not in fact so surprised.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the Securitate's spots had already written Herta Muller in July in the DiTime magazine after reading the 914 pages of his own dossier.
It may be suggested that the victims will have speculations and sometimes cause what real names have been hidden last the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
On the contrary to Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi dossiers is a reliable process, the attitude towards the heritage of the security dossiers is still very confused.
Systemic clarification has been unlocked and frozen in the past years.
Only in 1999 a national council that corresponds to the Birthler Institute was created to work on the archiving of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the refund of dossiers has been soon passed.
Since 2005, there is a law which defines the management of the archives.
The influence of former members of the Security Security in Romania is still very large, it is confirmed by the interview of an elderly responsible for the Teenesvar Security that, after the announcement of the Nobel Price transfer to Herta Muller, he expressed in a three-third-treasuring ways towards the Lauréate.
She had a psychopath, and finally we asked him only one time.
The famine of power thought could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Of course, many inelectable questions are associated with the case Söllner as this is so often occurd in a hidden guilty context.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? The weighted reaction of auditors, with Söllner, will hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be defined more by a sweet of knowing than by accusions and feelings of pain.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who received the Nobel price yesterday, is more than one note on page.
Tumpets at the League Champions
There was an impression that a representative had arrived there, shooted to four edges of all the right of a celebration of a sympa Christmas, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had stolen his goods when the new trainer VFB Christian Gross mounted less than the quarter in a Mercedes Class C, which was just called, a other platform sack of the supplier on the hand.
The man, whose key clan would attract the attention, let himself drive in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise, our fifth would have been able to take himself the flight – he had no alcohol and he wasn't a happy happiness.
He had been a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's going to be starting.
The words of the Swiss that we had come to join three days early were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," it is, in the link of chambers thanks to our 3:1 against the Unia Urziceni of Romania," but we do not have to let us swallow by success. This will be a brutal fight to not turn back."
The "great work" is waiting for the Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat the results of Championship link to daily.
And the weaknesses that were reflected on the surface after the three expeditive objectives of Marica (5.), Trish (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Treatment of sort
The eighth end of the Champions League Champions (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be tired at the end of December 18th to Nyon.
The joy of the full functioning entry of the successor of Babylon was therefore modifyed.
And the joy was not only modified in the one who had brought chance, who had transmitted to the destabilized professionals of Stuttgart, an unfair motivation and the joy of playing.
I've been seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their instruments, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "smuggler of the souls" – Gross - the receipt of success that sounded so much that had no more effects with the Babbel career.
He launched a certain magic, announced Jens Lehmann - part of Babbel, "and the foot when there is a new impulsion, it sometimes happens things that we would never have believed".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break-up for hurt, advanced the best player through its dynamicism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "frees wind" and the method of work of the new chief: "It is someone who passes to action and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babylon had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart did not pass the head, guarded by the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs especially tenacy.
As Gross, players and managers remain well assessing the victory against a totally exceededed defence and disappointed Roman invitations.
They also winned in Glasgow for four days later a bad wave in Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira object.
Horst Heldt, manager, reported that they were well achieved by one of the season objectives but that there were others who were still far.
We haven't left the hard head yet.
That Heldt the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first weekly victory since three months, is of the events of the weekend that a television interview of the guard of but Jens Lehmann had joined just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take, and not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's accompanying criticism.
He had accused the direction of style weakness and said she had decided to change trainer under the pressure of pubert fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousial since his day of free after the matches was removed.
Lehmann's statements were “marked by a pure selfish” funded Heldt and announced the consequences of the goal guard.
They couldn't become friends for the life of these two quarters.
In any case, they agreed for all the rest, namely, that without the previous work of the group by the replaced trainer, the strong sportive and combating representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success”, they turned Heldt and Lehmann in sweet – and even the man on the plastic shoe.
World weight Championship
The warm battle in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenged the chain of the world Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its title of the world's chamber of weight after WBC Federation.
On the one hand, the judges were imposed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains its title of the world's weight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that in the Saturday night the 38-year-old Champion had brought a victory to the uniminimity of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko defendes his title since his headback on the scene in October 2008.
Before Ukrainian had already reported the title of the WBO and WBC Federations World Championship twice.
Unfortunately, he did not have the KO so waited.
Klitschko, who had 39 times winner in 41 professional battles, has two times confessed his fault because of damage.
The challenger Johnson has accepted his first struggle at the 24th battle.
In the Berne Aren, before 17.000 spectacles, the Great Klitschko was particularly wanting to dicte the battle from its upper 2,02 meters from his left.
Johnson, of 11 centimeters smaller that had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded to avoid the cuts of the champion, so Klitschko tried to join in his game against harmful right.
Johnson, too passive to a challenge, especially tried to pass through the rounds.
While he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and shoots, his cuts were only very rarely reaching the champion.
It is even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of fun in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the treaty of "zombie villas" which is "not really capable".
During the Wednesday, the champion was not able to prevent Johnson by making him cut off his nest sunlight "to see his eyes".
Fourth winner since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko was imposed again in his fourth battle since his rear back on October 11, 2008
After a breakout of almost four years, he had struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and restored the WBC ceinture that he had previously left without fight.
This year, defending his champion title, he reverses the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
“I just took a shock in this fight and I'm in perfect form” said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring.
His relief is trying to join the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is the Champion of WBO Federations and IBF.
But this is the British David Haye, who, rounded the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, takes the WBA's ceinture.
This was, Haye had canceled a game against Vitali Klitschko that had been held in September.
It seems that his promotion company intended to play this match at the Wembley stage in London.
The Kunduz case
On the front of the opposition: the head of the Parliamentary Group of Verts, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of the Goodtenberg Defence of Mention in the case of the Affaire Kunduz.
The SPD and the left (the left) parties request the chance of explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - after reviewing the last information on the aircraft of Kunduz, the opposition repressed the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) to have discussed some of the facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contraverty" on the murder of two cytern trucks in September, said the head of the Verts Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the ERD "Tagsview" chain issue.
Of course, it means he lies.
The order to kill was given to the total unprecedented rules of the International Security Force in Afghan (ISAF).
This is the content of the NATO report, which has been read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the target of the fleet was in reality, not to destroy the buried trucks, but was well aimed to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or blessed during the American aircraft attack which had been launched at the request of the Dutch Colonel Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left requested the Challenge Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak in the shortest terms before the Federal Parliament and to find out what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Great Renate Kunst are viewed that Mrs. Angela Merkel should clearly tell whether the targeted masturbation strategy is part of the Afghan Government's federal government policy if the lucky, military and information services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's speaking port rejects these criticisms.
There was no chance to influence the military interventions in Afghanistan, said it.
On Saturday, votes were more stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of the Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as submitted by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper information, the information they provided to Guttenberg on the attack of Chinese trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have dismissed the existence of the NATO report and hid a number of generic details to the Minister.
In the course of the two high officials, however, they have heard that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein, and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter General Suntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had asked in an email to clarify the facts.
Until now, he has not received answers
On Saturday, the Ministry did not want to comment these accuseds and return to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee that would be the next Monday to deport the light on the facts concerned.
The Song Worlds
Some see, all waking, images and hear voices that no one else can see no one.
There is not only psychic diseases, or under drug effect, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
While these phenomena appear during the sleep, it's okay.
When we're long in our assuming rooms, we can give us the worst dreams and fantasms.
However, the one who, smiling, makes the experience of the dream state, hears and sees things that others do not understand, quickly has the reputation in our western world of being crazy or drugd, or at least a original.
Such images and voices appear not only in psychic or under drug effects.
It's our imagination that is in question: it's the same neuron activity that allows us to design houses, develop tables, or write romans, but it sometimes incites the limits between dream, fool and reality to be found.
A conscious state, taking the form of a dream, can be presented under the most different forms, in the best cases it is called visions, in the worst of the fool.
However, even if the decreetor and the effects differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard van Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the calls, psychoses and hallucinations are very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delights when equilibres, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - in the first place, dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and aquelcholine - are broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is perturbed.
Complete hallucinations and delivering thoughts are very often shown during a shozophrenic psychose.
The earthquake attraction force has no power on the person.
Since the antiquity, philosophies and doctors have always been on the relationship between fool and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a shape of dreams; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatrist, found in 1861 "a great similarity between fool and dream", for Sigmund Freud, was even a psychist with all irregularities, imaginations, delights and sensual illusions."
We are in the autonomy 2001 when Henning T becomes a characterized band.
His body is in two sizes of creating colours.
The earth attraction has no power on him, he plans at the root of the platform.
He feels a shooting.
Before him, the creatures of ailable devil, grimming, the instant mouth, showing the dents.
They continue him, give him shocks with sweet sweet tits, smell it against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Trying voices, wicked, hurling, out of walls and radio.
It can't support these voices that blame it and humble.
Henning T. strikes two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a ball and attacks it to a platform set.
He goes on a bathroom, and it's going to be the ball around the shoe.
He's slow.
The ball is down.
That it serves to you of lesson, they crie the voice in a shore to smile the tympan. "Go in a clinic and give you care!"
Today Henning T. to 40 years of age, he lived six acute psychos, the last two-year date, the first 20-year-old age.
She was disabled by LSD.
Diagnostic : psicso-affective, paranoid, in addition, it is maniaco-depressive, he takes medication against depression, hand, skizophrenia.
He learned to live with his disease, he was married for three years.
During psychism I lived terrible fears and deep hopes.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
A percentage of the population suffers at least once in his life of skizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crysophornia crisis, the persons concerned cannot do the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a hyper excitation state, which makes it possible to suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relative fool or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices commanding, commenting or dialoging.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can't do the distinction between the important and the insignifiant, the brain can't filtre the distorting signals, the conscience is frozen under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosm opens the exclusions to a slight of ideas and fantasms brings the deepest beds of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is based on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Hedelberg CHU Psychiatry Division (General Psychiatry in Universitysklinikum) .
The sczophrene is located in the fully center of the situation, with a meaning covered on it.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and can't act on them actively.
This is the reason why Schyzophrene often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Do experience once in his life of hallucination.
According to Fuchs, "the sensitive and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
Delivering thoughts and hallucinations are based on the reality, the alliance of life is in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of horses, it's always an enemy for researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everybody to lose timely the perception of the reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a few people will develop a psychose.
It seems to have a genetic predisposition to Schyzophrenia, but studies on jumeal have shown that genes are not the only determinant factors.
The researchers believe that the persons concerned are present incredibly cerebral lesions.
The neuronal maturation of the brain is supposed to be perturbeded at a early stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains still unexplied is the way the neuron system's anonymity is produced and overwhelms the fact that it is not manifested for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychological decline, however, if there is predicted.
Similarly, hallucinogen drugs can deploy psychoses because they act on neurotransmissioners.
When our brain is heat.
What's stupid, we say the professor of Psychiatology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations, and they take medications to deal with it while others buy strong drugs to sell it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten has assembled for ten years the reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomenon: last year he published his results in a book titled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are often part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also of an impressive number of other pathologys.
It is among them psychological problems such as borderline or depression, but also migration, epilepsia, placa sclerose, Alzheimer's disease or clan traumatism.
It is surprising to see that, even in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that treat sensitive perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently reflected; when our brain is heating but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can deploy this state as a brain lesion or psychose.
But also the lack of stimulation, stress, love chagrins or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of the participants recognized have done at least once in his life the experience of hallucination.
During the year 2005, Sarah K. at 16 years, she lived in a small town of Mecklemburg-Pomerania and went to school.
A young girl is going to make it normal to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, mysterious, at the long shoes of the castle, gives him the word.
When she answers her friends look at her, they're surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They're thinking that this tired young girl is a lunatic dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's shooting, listening and seeing this boy as she looks and hears the girl who's sit next to her on the bank.
It may even see its presence at present.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathy.
I'm fool, sometimes asking her.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appears generally.
Remember visions are painful.
When it is in class, it can't follow the course because the teacher is just in presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the teacher is visible in explaining equations in the table.
The night appears generally.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rare and too late, she can not often do the distinction if it is washed or dream already, if the images that she sees, the griming faces or the young girl with bloody shoes on the arms and feet are found before her open or closed eyes.
Let me calm down, cry to these creatures.
She's not talking to her parents or to his friends, they would take it for a fool.
On Monday 2009. Sarah K. has 20 years today.
She had her bag last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she entered into contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well she's not foolish.
The fool is also a work of desperate art.
When a person is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, the probability is great that he has hallucinations in the end of a certain time.
I think that the brain is not enough occupied, so that there's an animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had fear of other children when she was small and often played all the way.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 years, that the man her named Dad, since she was age of thinking, was not her true father.
These are the same cerebral areas that are active for visual and acute hallucinations, and for real impressions and bruits, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between the illusion and the reality. "Each experience," says Kasten "is in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form themselves in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy persons are not fundamentally different from those in augmented psychosis.
Instead of the sczophrene, mentally sacred person is able to recognize that fans are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our too quickly focused on conscience, there is a tendency to take imaginative experiences for pathology, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Head of Psychiatric and Psychiatric Hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a serious, painful disease, but also contains something positive, creator - the fool is an art of hope.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of oniroid experience, a special form of the change of conscience that was waved by the dream.
Oniroids are very complex semi-reve vessels that are perceived as real by the living one and can't vary from the dream even when he is in heavy state.
Oniroid consciousness is demonstrated during traumasis or in extreme pathologys, such as patients who have been fully conscious of polyradiopathy, makes experience of a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and world, because of a total and sustainable moveable incapacity, he replaces this real situation that leads to his life, by its imaginative world that is disappeared from the reality.
It's a mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change has occurred, but the real situation is represented in imagination.
It is, in fact, a intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to shame in the desire of the loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in the memorys.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, artist of art describes also his oniroid experiences in his book "Carter's End" as an action to save the soul.
He has 49 years of age when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a cardiac valve followed by transplantation; during that time his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen slows in a world that he created from all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees in old man alive in a rail sanatorium, a robot with his horse watching his health.
It lives in a mid-year age among nobles that produce blood-based drugs.
He is removed by a Greek moto that brings him to his country, he survives with his hospital bed in the neighbor of the Alpes and meets a mafious Korean.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginative world, everything is real even later in his memory.
According to Claussen, these internal trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a very different state, writeing what he lived.
On the contrary to dreams, memories from mind travels are extremely clear and very detailed even in the years later.
It may even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than real life.
The intensity of this life makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oniroid delire, psychososis, hallucinations and psychodeal experience show us how fragile our internal representations of the external reality are even in ill state.
Any change in the state of conscience, the psychologist Kasten "is possible to cause a deformation of what we call the reality."
A experience that can also be really rich.
The first necks may fall
Burden
To 27 years of age, children will take the post of the edition house.
The appointment of Kallen at the PDG of Burda editions is a intermediary solution: Hubert Burda wants to take the press group, said to the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain at 100% of a family company.
Hamburg - In long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his company among his children's hands
The two children will be here for 27 years and are strongly decided to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years old in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be as follows.
You should also see if they are capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children to 7500 collaborators without know if they have the ability to take care of them.
This would democrate children as well as the company.
Burda had known on Thursday last day that he would take place from President-General since January and that his post was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Karen, 52 years old, is a member of the Administration Council since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technological sector.
Then he was employed by the Trésor sector to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the department of Jürgen Toden выше he also took the head of the marketing, foreign sector, print and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member that is headed by the Burda editions.
Burda's children have 19 and 17 years of age, her son Felix, who had 42 years of age, died a few years ago.
The namement of Kallen also serves to do the link of the 10 or 15 next years."
Burda specifies that the holding must remain to 100% among the hands of the family.
The disasters have always occurred in families that have left to enter into a capital bolimia, which have made huge spills by thinking that they could still be shocked up.
This has never been my strategy.
I never have dreamed universal power, said Burda.
I do not absolutely see in the role of the country's precepter as it could be Springer and I don't intend to make part of these international links like the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
All you can want, in the area of beauty and well-being, to handle.
This is the same goal that the English Court has been set, which has been introduced in the Trade Center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and the attention of the body.
The spa, situated at the eighth stage, opens prestigious teachers such as Hedonai, a specialist of laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation and ethical treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, coiffers, Marina d'Or, which has a sport room, or Western and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food radiation, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among others, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while considering the exceptional views of the capital, or to locate the relaxed area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax you with a jacuzzi session, to pursue a champagne cup.
In total, there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where the most renovative care of the face, body and hydrotherapy can be used.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sport room also has these devices, as well as virtual "infiltrers" that lead to the steps of customers by proposing a completely personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a tactil screen, located in front of the device.
several videos show us how to correctly execute our performance programme.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (exhibition and editions included) are sufficient to work all the muscles of the body.
And if you have done our body, we want to pass through the coiffure room, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where you propose hair repair, luminosity or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to have been the order words of this urban space, which will be open every day from 10 a.m. to 22h.
Variable collections
Christmas approaches and it's never superflue to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party guard.
The form of decoration, very important to put the silhouette in value, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Fergie's song has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollency. This is not very advised.
Finsa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Finsa Electricity company, in collaboration with the Barcelone Board, has created the LIVE Office.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalonia capital.
The ‘LIVE’ Office will define and coordinate the road sheet for electric vehicles in the city and establish mobility agreements, by performing switchs, coordinating, subventions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to start what will become the transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric cities’
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to launch electric vehicle installation.
The Endsa Electric Company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitate of Catalogne.
It aims at promoting research and technological development activities in the Catalogue's autonomy Community.
Among these are energy-related activities, especially energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative to Finsa participate in the promotion of electric vehicle.
The company is involved in standardization groups at the European level and has undertaken a set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero entered "a future of calmity" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, entered “a future of tranquility” for the Spanish car industry, which, remembered, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the implementing measures launched during the year in order to support the automobile sector.
"Onless the Auto Sector's Competitiveness Plan, we had today a landscape of abandoning some of our main production sites", stated the President of the Government.
"We can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector, thanks to this plan and to the decision of staying in Spain, in a very competitive sector."
In that sense, he recalled that the Competence Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Mobile Sector (PIA), had allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 assistant companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Executive Chief explained that this investment was intended to develop new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the Government's support measures in the 2000E Plan in cooperation with autonomy communities and automobile enterprises.
According to the President, this plan allowed 6 per cent of the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain and contributed to a “slight increase” of recording, which progressed with 40 per cent in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Salon, a meeting space for the professionals and the passionates of the engine world.
This initiative will be held from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellon of Cristal de la Casa de la Campo de Madrid.
These are a exposure surface of 20 000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exposures will be presented.

Availability tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also be carried out on an adjusted circuit outside the exposure park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : Sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sportive spirit is not cold with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has been integrated in Mazda3 the motor stop and starting system, baptized by i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on Engine 2.0 to 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note she reached in its whole.
The details, the end of the vehicle, housing, behavior, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are noted on the new Mazda3.
Starting through the conducting position, the front seats have an outstanding ergonomic and a excellent fixing.
The flight toucher is also particularly pleasant to him.
Continuing with the whole form of the control table and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a future inner design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue colours.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that Mazda3 is well that Civic, both Japanese, is in contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
In continuing with the accommodation, the Japanese car is compactly more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a higher comfort level.
Add to all this a large cover to regular forms.
The engine's automatic stop and launching system, at least for now, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It illustrates by its finish, low sound, performance and management of his consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with the essential engine, both for its large speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the selected model for the test is the Sport, otherwise says that presents the largest number of series elements.
Between the series of machines, the road change assistant that removes the dead angle, the traction controls and stability, the speed controller, the slight-sensitive internal viewer, the board computer on a large screen, the stationing captures, the independent climateization, the rain and light captor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-pound alignement routes, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment wasn't enough, this version of the Premium Pack that includes the other elements of adaptable bi-xenon pharmaceuticals and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not much kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the machine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the end of Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sport.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"Prima" of luxury
L.A. Recover the red sensual mass incarned by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more bleed than ever, stones of so elegant models than sexy for the outdoor of Nine. (Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", sophisted as well as dwelling, had opted for a dark "Lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, this is a device that only allows to look at its email, without offering the possibility, would only be to see some type of joint parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory to the United States when the Time magazine was designated as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for youth.
On the contrary to Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or not less than half of what it costs, for example, the data subscription of iPhone.
With the success, the company launched two new devices: one design only for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more than Peek.
FonPeek, presented last night at the Web event, is the European version of the invent and its third incarnation.
It's so limited as his grand-american brother, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what is the fact that it is to reject the data when it is crossed or seek a wifi coffee on the WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his email.
The idea of a rolling to a fixed price is incredibly sweet and it makes it work as long as it works.
In fact, some operators have special travel agreements and options, but in me, I should have made a physical thesis to understand them and good lunetts to read small characters.
Remembers of the European Commission to propose approachable roaming tariffs in all Europe have resulted in perceived effect.
Out of its country of origin, data are being used and it is not wrong.
That a small instrument like the FonPeek (this is always curioso that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, it means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to make their data network restructuring.
Child is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is paid at its purchase and not each month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FundPeek: a buy option with life access as Peek already proposes to the United States.
I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it is a more fair form for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is certainly the color prefered by the first woman of the United States.
If it was taken by Barack Obama to the President of the United States with a shooting and a mantel of this color, she actually chose the same to join it in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of her life: the transfer to Oslo of the Peix Nobel price.
Michelle Obama had a very likely model in these two occasions: in addition to their like color, a yellow towards the green with brilliant reflections, the holding was three parts: robe, clothes and mantels, in the same tissue, and was orded of a large brodery or a collar.
Although a first shock of eye, it seemed to be the first woman of the United States to follow the silence of the Prince of Asturies and had chosen to return the same holdings.
But the tissue in which the two assemblies are divided makes them very different.
If it was a swimming dense, instead, she carried a printed speed to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green house shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but sweet this time.
The coiffure also changed: the hairs are now highlighted while she was taken to them the same time.
75% of working mothers had professional problems because of their motherhood
Labour discrimination has increased in the past few years, especially for young generations who want to be mothers.
That's what the study “Fecondiction and professional career of women in Spain” shows, conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women Institute.
The survey, conducted by 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years of age, does not doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers who worked working have seen their limited professional career because of maternality.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of couple life and the number of children, if women work or not, and the type of employment.
Those who do not have work outside the home, have part-time work or have little stability work, set up in a couple, have their first pregnancy and have more children.
However, women with stability employment, mainly in the public sector, reject the entry into couples and first pregnancy, and have less children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age who have a fixed job have a first child, average, 3,7 years after being installed in a couple, which are at 4,1 in those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a stable job have needed more time in their life to get it, which brought them to retreat the unity and arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of employment is largely influenced by maternity, but less the date of common life", explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado's research.
The level of study is another factor that crosses the difference in the age of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, higher training levels are married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, the primary and higher studies were mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years in average.
“Another discernment appears also among women, according to their level of study.
While those who have undertaken elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have made a medium or higher study inverse this program and give priority to obtain a stable work as a prevailing condition for marriage and arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also values
Oreal Paris has come to add a new name to his jalous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actor will incarcer the image of several brand products, pointing out the universal rate “for I do well”.
Joyeux Christmas protagonist, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, is thus joining other celebrations in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last ones to be penned in this club if selected were Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millennium).
In the men, the cosmetic mark also accounts for the luxury embassyers: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangely in Lost).
The prices of the British Mode
The Britishs have much to say in the mode world.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, at the Royal Court of Justice, were meeting for the annual remise of their prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed you.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected the Great Mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Poker Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Ass Pocker (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-third of "radiographies" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not according to the predictable and appreciative kinds (biographic, life and work summary), but is looking for something like the noyau of creating personality.
The trip is exciting, and Vincent does not spare any frauders or illusions.
Happy joy, this book is also an encouraging invitation to reading and recreation.
I'll leave you here some instantaneous.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual cleaning, almost physically, even if I felt without the name: the joy of the funeral destiny, the moral without guilty and the innocence without God."
About Samuel Beckett: “Nhilist, Alegoric Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impunity and ignorance, with a bleaking poetical humor, cut into sense, such as the lame of the kitchen that failed to kill him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that has thirty years old, in the flesh of which he conjugates the emotion of adultery to the satisfaction of the retreat, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Jimmy, “Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which has to be graved by the northern face, on which the best alpinists still slaughtered.”
On William Faulkner, "It was a strange guy.
In itself, he sometimes said he was the heritage of a Territory owner of the comte and other times that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This written writer collected the shout from a bridge by this Munch's personality to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century's night, in his literary form, and he put it into the fleet of himself and calling the postperiority with a violent talk to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: “Another day she took herself and a man: “God good loved, I pray you to stop writing as a woman.”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were slaughtered the verses of Scener: "The sleep after the struggle,/ after the temper, the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, slaughtered the death ravi."
On Virginia Wolf: "In his bags she also carried his depressions.
His husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edouard VII was epiling it among the blue or that birds were sing in Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and loved man from a frozen whose literary talent exceeded the fool.”
Sur Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos if it is to try to dismiss the Church at Baroja?
What do you try Benet if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this if it is not to spend the glory of this man to serve him of piedestal?”
A laugh of aggression
Last week, my mother, who had about 70 years, walked in our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed next to her and our dog, one kidney, saved from the SPA and did not wear more than six kilos, and without saying, they had two cuts of feet left the dog.
Our abuse is great, because we do not see what there's a comfort to attack freely a small animal without defence that was, moreover, left.
It must be added to the identification of a woman who was tranquilly walking and which, when she harmed these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, because an energetic that attacks a animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, a older person or, infinity, any person lower than it.
The episode is about 17 hours, a mardi as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's kids all day.
We have heard a complaint to the Commissioner of the neighborhood even if we don't want that it serves to big-chose and not to touch sensitivity, we just want to clarify that the murders were Spanish.
The indentation has brought us to condemn that fact.
We don't understand what happens with youths so they are comforting to harm freely a animal without defense that gives us affection, friendship and holds us company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and persons have been carried out.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the shipping port
The manufacturer of Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the bottle, mainly among the youngest motocyclists, as it has today been shown in the two structures.
This initiative aims to make aware of the importance of the port of the ship, as it is the only one of protection to avoid blessures to the head, or even the death, in case of accident in two reds.
Michelin stated that this campaign was in the line of its commitment to road security, which “besides the design and manufacturing of more secure products”, and claimed that it contributed to this objective by other pedagogic and informative actions.
This new shipport encouragement campaign in two wheels, under the "Tobe or not to be," will include a first phase during which shows will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure that it is the most wide range.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, as a pneumatic manufacturer for two road vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop more secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles has progressed
After almost two years the market of light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light on the top of the tunnel.
9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent in 2008, and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months of consecutive reduction, according to the numbers of the Anac and Ganama manufacturers' manufacturers' patent trade.
However, the good news should be sneaked, since the reference to comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a decrease of 60 per cent compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the reintegration of the last month, the accumulated records for these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (tracks of tourism, pick-up, forgonnets, slow-florgons and light chassis trucks) were sold 95 853.
The large clouds that are most affected by their request have not been denied, and indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 % of cases through external funding.
In addition to restrictions involved in the limiting of bank credits, other factors, such as increased unemployment rates or the persistence of bad economic conjunctions, must therefore be added.
In this situation and in the difference of tourism vehicles, the aid for the purchase of 2000E was few.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who want to purchase a light commercial vehicle less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions not exceeding 160 kg per km, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speak of themselves.
Last night, at Ganham, it was reiterated the need for the administration to address special attention to these vehicles and to industrial vehicles (cames and bus).
The association of grants prescribes a year similar to the end of 2010, for which it calculates a decline of sales (touring vehicles and 4x4) of 19 per cent.
Emergency shipping assistance is now binding
As this happened with the ABS antiblocking system and how this will be done with ESP stability control, emergency relief systems will be a binding element on European cars.
They are already binding on tourist cars and newly registered commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a car has been established until the end of February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed at strengthening the protection of peetons, even if, by its action mode, it may also contribute to avoid many back shocks.
The assistant at the emergency fresh works by increasing the pressure on fresh in case of emergency detected by the system by the driver's footsteps given.
But this last does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the car before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from the whole force.
Until 1 100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the contrary, requires the maximum of the fresh system, reduced the distance of which the car is required to stop.
According to a EU study, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 mortal accidents in which piettons could be evacuated each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency freeze systems: it would be calculated that a four-three fatal with fertilizers would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the carriage.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increased pressure on the pedale, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the goods to minimise damage.
General Motors stays until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel of Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during April's first week – probably 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer said that there will be more time to end the Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, agrees that each point of the plan was approved by the Party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and to the Governments of the country where the plants are found, is reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, in GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has renewed the pressure on the American manufacturer so that it takes a decision as fast as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the candidate of the Dutch Sport Skyper manufacturer, supported by the Russian Convergen Group, takes the importance.
In the case of no agreement with them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
On the flight of Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious hill, the Porsche engineers left from the Boxster S and successfully slowed it out of nothing less than 80 kg, which leaves the balance only 1 275 kg.
This led them first from the automatic toilet that was replaced by a manual smoke tower to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilometers less than the GT3, to remove the climate, 13 kilos, to reduce the reserve of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winning, to mount sports backs, even 12 kilos, and with light pounds of 19 pounds, five kilograms.
Finally, they rejected the CDR-30 audio system, wining so 6 other kilograms and replaced the doors in tissues, economizing the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double PDK box, the test was performed on a manual model of six speeds, mainly on roads of the secondary network in California, in the mountain, with particularly turbulent virgins.
His behaviour can only be qualified of irreproofable.
The reduction of weight does not prevent the driving car on the ground with applomb.
On the contrary, it was long since we had not tested such a small and light model that guarantees both security in virgins, including a large speed.
It's a small athlet, able to escape his muscles to small speed during the necessary time, until we requested him to spring, frozen, recover and pull his motor again...
This is what we want. Thanks to his direction, as well as to the specific, the car will show our hands on the flight.
And she will do it with a surgical precision.
Son of a Engine to volunteer
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened by the "sport" option or by a system that changes the switch of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either for the arrest or for recovery.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or inconfortable.
The revestigation of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite slow, but the car was well managed the powder nests.
E-assistants made an act of presence on the whole traject, while on some girls we found a small morning and gravities, later in the morning.
Finally, a ultralaw car, more diverting to drive and that is much more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, coco Cocoon line icon and occasional starlet of the house's dysfunctions, the song shows his face of a bad girl with the same content as his channel sacks.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "I Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Labour Caja obtained a triomphe of 91-82 at his visit to Maccabi Electra's Arrow field, despite the many absences of Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is so headed by her group, after the large spectacle of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight carriages to three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team composed the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of collective commitment and work, even if it had had to wait until the end to return the victory.
Furthermore, the great ability from the perimeter, with 16 carriages with three marked points, widely determined the final victory.
The match began rapidly for the blue and red, which took the advantage since the beginning.
The fact that the first four carriages of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter, they were allowed to predict that they were cut on the Israeli terrain with the warm pounds.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's internal game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applauses to return to his old house, to increase their advantage in the pause (34-43).
Teletovic began to look at the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the "minute six" evaluation of Splitter had already been expected that this night would not be the best of Brazilians.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the good way to break, nothing was played away from there, and the Avala team wanted to remember Vitoria that it was not so easy to win on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elias," they were able to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, but far away from being dead, needed to engage a few skilled action to take the air, and at that time, Mirza Teletovic's channel, which, with three consecutive cars and help of England and Ribas, returns the accounter to a slight score (54-67), and the locals were successful to reach at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team was out to play all over the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said that they would not let anyone take what they had merely for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it since the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic players did not shoot, defended well, and the Israelites were approached during the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory fled to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Fears prevent the Unicaia of delivering battle
The Unicaya was burningly lost in Greece faced the Olympicos, and he was heading of the B Group of Europe, at a match marked by the absence of Unicaya players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been affected by the environment of the Peace and Amicide pavillon, nor by the rival overwhelming, certainly one of the most powerful of Europe and has a large budget.
The first quarter time game was allowed to dream the andalouss. A aggressive defense and three carriages with three consecutive points, two of Mr. Omar Cooks and one of Guillem Rubio, who broke the local team 12-18 at the nineth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaya, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, was allowed to turn the 22-20 scene at the thirteenth minute, at the time of an action, a bagarre start, among the North American mentors Beverley and Williams, involved the disqualization of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in the two camps, while the outcome of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jimenez pesed on the Unicaja.
The internal players and the lituan shepherd Linas Kleizs, with their cars to three points, crossed the advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
Unable remount
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, showed up the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48 at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group.
Unicaya tried to overcome the absences and the last outcome of the pivot was shocked by Robert Archibald during the meeting.
Despite all of these problems, Unicaya, through its organization, the carneys at three points of Cookie, and Lewis' support, was a little hope with 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because the Olympics were implacable when the players made pressure and showed their suppression in centimeters in the area.
The croata pivot Nikola Vujcic, successfully able to restore the score at 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja was presented, accepting the Olympics' victory.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users may know the wage they would pay on their profile, through a new application of Trovit, the most smallest search engine in Spain, real estate advertising, employment and vehicles.
The tool " How much should you be paid?" calculates user salaries from more than 140 000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week that the application works, the research engine detected that, in general, the Spanish worker “floorly feels rewarded” explained in a reporter, Albert Ribera, who was responsible for Trovit’s products.
According to the data provided by Trouve from its research engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish are less payed.
A British IT programmer resulted from 45 226 euros per year and a French 31 059, while a Spanish receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, a driver was 34 247 euros per year in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the latest work paid in Spain is the server, with EUR 11,592 net annual net, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the employer, with 15,667 euros.
In the past three months, Internet jobs are the conductors, average jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's start
The Brazilian Government has established a period for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Deputy President shall leave the diplomatic ligation until 27 January 2010, date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, the embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he is refugeed since 21 September, before that date.
"He has conscious that he must go on January 27, following his mandate, he must search for another destination."
The chain also mentioned the former mandate, which confirmed its intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to get out as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (which was elected by Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week he tried to find refugee in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political condiction to imply him to the government as a chairman by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After roses since the last spring, during which the inflation of assets constituted the dominant note on the markets, the incertitude is again uncertain, which is not surprised because it is their natural status, in a environment where agents take decisions on a future by incertain nature.
The currency used by the Central Banks to stabilize the markets was to pay the debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing sufficient liquidity to near zero rates, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets has been practiedly finished and, without dealing with their non-conformable liquidity policy, they began to put a little swimming in the reds, such as the ECB, with their appropriation for one year in the next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic relaxation without heterodox measures, and we are being assisted in an inverse of risk prime reduction.
The volatility of bourses and the disappearance of the obligations of enterprises continues to increase, although they remain very distant from the paranormal levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been obliged to socialize the private risk and public debt again affected.
There is again a commitment to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been refugees chosen by investors, resulting in increased differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was affected by this episode of instability, but then standard & Poor'sa threatened a new review at the lowest qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of incertitude is not bad to stop the defenders of the moral risk, which reiterately tried to cause a case of consciousness of the world's economic policy responsible who had freed the destructive effects from the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decrease a new day of Appreciation.
However, the Dubai situation looks like a tribal struggle among the emotions to return its place to the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that deceives a public deficit, elections and a new government that discovers the rose pool.
Fit in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that the Ecofin would save Hungary from a non-humanity of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State in the euro area to not respect its commitments.
In contrast, the Ecofin urged the Greek Government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope it, we face an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few exceeds in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, while our disappearance from public debt increases in the measure of European enterprises obligations, we have no concern to us.
If European disappearances were reduced and our people continue to increase, it would then be an Spanish idiosync risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anodecision. When our predictive indicators are obligation to most studies services to advance their relaxation models and to revise their predicts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the load of a Japanese model for Spanish economy, it will not have much hope for their warning.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment, "certainty is the mother of security".
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene in the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputy, where the Spain's energy strategy was discussed in these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán for the press that he had called before the Subcommission at eight-class.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 million euros until 2020 to 60 billion to 2030, where nuclear centrals today operating would remain open.
If not, the necessary investments would not be up to 600,000 million, but 95 000.
On the contrary, Iberdola considers that investment must not be dedicated to increased production capacity, but to the distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue is changed, and the power must be increased.
It is also focused on gas and carbon centres, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that more than 18 000 MW are needed, with other “energy energy”.
Galán, who believes that the project of the Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has adopted is in line with what its company claims, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which opposes climate warming policies.
According to him, there is “a clearly long-term parameter” in this regard, despite the “pontual” measures, as the President of Iberdrola was qualified.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are on a long term, have to begin to be taken, because they take some time before they reach their maturity and that a stable payment framework is necessary for them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus’ maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss company, Ferrovial branch, will play the privacy association of the Irish airline Air Lingus, for goods services, in ten European airports where it is presented.
Paris, London, Francfort or Brussels are most important.
The agreement, whose terms have not been revealed, has a five-year period.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Castilla-La Mancha and Alcalá University of Henares signed a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligence Innovation Centre.
The Alliance provides an investment of 20 million up to 2012, with 50 per cent from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to conduct energy efficiency research on authors and airports.
Acciona controversies his first author in Australia in Hochtief and Buygues
Acciona is struggled for its first author in grantion in Australia, the market on which it is already working as energy and water manager.
The playing channel is a tunnel estimated to $1,700 million ($1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to be established in the country as a company of public and automobile workers.
The city's chief wants to be able to dispose for the end of 2014.
After having chosen public/private cooperation (PPP for its initials in English) to conduct the project in the context of a business plan under the whole of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists that will be charged by the chanter and the operation of the rent.
In the expectation of the submission of their offers in May, the investment planned is $1,700 million ($1,047 million) and in the last stage there are three consortiums, with a significant presence of European constructors.
The Baptized Transity group is conducted by Acciona, the only Spanish company in literature, and its associations are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of subterranean work.
Acciona's team is built the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager of Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has been tested is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (Filiale of the German Builder Hochtief, which is available to its ACS's participation), a local company, Baulderstone (owner of the Dutch Bilfinger Berger Group) and the specialized company in public works, Razel.
Australian infrastructure market promises great chainers and privatizations, but it is a great difficulty if it is not through the way to purchase a local construction company.
A strategy that has followed the Hochtical and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to Asian references, and which remains a non-valid step for the Spanish Gentiles of the Sector.
ACS was able to conquer a market location by its participation of 30 per cent in the Hochific, the owner of Leighton.
Millennium assets
Acciona sets out on a geographical area of the most important for the sector, where it has already a large presence through its energy provider activities and the dissolving sector.
Among other actives, it has the largest eolian park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leaders the grouping of undertakings with the Adeleida Desalineator, with a budget of 700 million.
It is now intended to consolidate these two areas and benefit synergies to enter into the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The subterranean road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link, is called to connect Toowong's western road to the device road to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 km from the tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce the traffic in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the Administration indicates that the appropriation will take place during the summer 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this pathway will be opened at the end of 2014, the chain is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will understand two ways, an electronic peak system and a complex venture system.
The Queensland Government will provide $500 million for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochific
Australia continues to make widely fructifying Hochific, which mentioned last night the obtaining of a contract with the government estimated to 154 million.
The company detained by ACS will equipte, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the high-level high-fibre national network.
This intervention will allow 4000,000 people to have fast internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company entered the King George Tour construction project on 27 floors in Brisbane City. Works have not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is seeking a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine filial, is able to build a tunnel of 2,1 km long for an authorisation in Slovenia for a amount of 64,5 million euros.
The company has obtained this contract a few days after being seen in the increased work of the Bosruck tunnel (Autriche) for a total of 130 million.
Alpine comforts his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the channel is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its achievement will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore can help Renfe's advertising
Renfe has granted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs. Rushmore for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, stated the rail operator.
The contract indicates the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agents who were presented at the appointment organized by Renfe, among which four were finalized, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity during the last three years.
From now, Mrs. Rushmore will be charged by the design and production of campaigns.
A 63 million amendment in France Télécom to free competition
The French competition regulator has affected a amendment of 63 million euros in France Télécom for its anti-competitive behaviors in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the telephone competition by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by regular consumers' fidelity programmes.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and state company accumulates more than 450 million euros in amendments since 1994, due to the obstacles that it brings to its competitors.
Inflicted sanctions have also been increased because the authority that ensures competition is considering that France Télécom has made similar crimes in the past and that it is therefore reciprocal.
Application book
On the other hand, the French mobile telephone filial monitored the switch of other operators and opened an Internet Application Book, with a goal to increase the receptives that do not result from the transmission of voting.
At the beginning, the ONG's application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It should be expected for 2010 to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Championship League reported 476,4 million in the Real Madrid and Barza since its creation
The Championship has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona winned 467.4 million, with their place in third and fifth position of clubs that have put the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Gain the EUFA Champions Liga does not only provide the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the large clubs.
Indeed, the competition has shared 5 362.5 million euros to 105 teams (from 12 Spanish) which participated in the event since the development of the tournai during the 1992-1993 season, according to EUFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served at this division.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for his participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has returned three times the troop.
The Catalan club, which is currently the title and last winner of the former Coupe of Europe in 1992, is the fifth list.
Headquarters are the Manhattan United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, made the most money for their participation in the last Champions Liga.
And that, even though they've lost before the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported by the Championship League, although it has reported more titles than any other (5).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex payment procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini intends to win 1 090 million thanks to the Champions Liga.
From this sum, the EUFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classification matches (including Madrid Atlantics) has received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have been successfully successfully received only 3.8 million to be there, more than 550.00 euros for each deputy match.
There is also a winner in cases of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team), which arrived in the eighth end of each, the eight teams that arrive in the fourth end are 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive every 4 million.
And the Champion will win 9 million, face to 5.2 receiving by the other finalist.
Thus, as regards fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barza was 2.5 million to have returned the Super Coupe of Europe in August.
However, there are variable payments, which are equipped with 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spain market is one of the most important and has four affected places.
The sample of the previous year is 40 % of the money affected, 30 % for the second, 20 % for the third and 10 % for the fourth.
The other party will be paid on the basis of the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group referred to the details of the purchase of actions by which it intends to purchase a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not allow it to start a public purchase offer (OPA) for the totality of the titles.
Concretely, New Romasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action, which will be decreased in 10 years and will be paid to a rate of 1 per cent per year for this report.
Sos' actions have been finished at EUR 1.85; the offer of New Rumasa thus evaluates the company under the market by 18 per cent.
According to New Romasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' real evaluation.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for the shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of titles.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Matheos' company stated that it had been contacted with the regulator.
If it had happened, the decline would be of 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
By waiting, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay outside events of purchase and vault offers and judicially comes from his former directors, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Maria Luis Jordá as the director of Internal Audit.
A decision that is actually the first woman to take a headquarter in the food company.
This is a newly established post which will depend directly on the President of the Group.
And it is not exempted from polemics, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for more than 230 million Sos to salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the next months Seas reveals new fund distortions cannot be discarded.
With regard to the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaya) declared last night before the National Audit that they had been informed of the displacement of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorises the Paternina exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Commission of Value Market (CNMV) authorized last October the Exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on the last 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms would be adapted to the current standards and that it would consider the content of the explicit sheet submitted, according to the amendments applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV indicated that the offering relates to the acquisition of 550 008 actions from Federico Paternina to a price of EUR 7,65 per action, which represents 8,95 per cent of the social capital, which consists of 6 142,786 shares granted to negotiations on the bourses of Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, it explained that 5 592 778 million actions have been immobilised and that they could not be transmitted before the end of the offer, which stated that the price was established by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules laid down in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these bad days of time and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Each day, thousands of cars that have been covered are returned to a garage, where a expert must evaluate the decay and the cost of repair.
Each left is different, and the calculation of the costs of the parts and the time of work may be a long and complex work.
Calculate the cost of a reparation of EUR 20 000 to 30 000, including the parts and the working hand may take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the recent computer tools, it would be a question of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the evaluation and maintenance are compared to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North America Group of Solera, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are performed with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far away from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to be treated has been still increased, while over the past five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the past 15 years.
When a new car goes on the market, these companies are working.
This is a very delicate job, since each of the thousands of the vehicle must be catalogued and registered.
Furthermore, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a model sold massively, the work can be prepared for a week if the process is very fast.
If it is a little sold car, it can take three or four months. Actually, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of commercialized cars in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or the Lambourghini.
With regard to vehicles, the number exceeds 99 %.
To work on documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight different centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than hundred technicians (general experts in mechanic) are working simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2,5 million data are registered, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this large flow of information allows these companies to give them a variety of uses and propose different products.
The most frequent application relates to the reparation and maintenance, but, according to the countries, there are also tools for the management of cash parts or to calculate the value of a car or residue.
The only company that has a guide that refers to the value of the opportunities cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make a idea of the type of support that it can provide to the professionals of the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the farm product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the evaluation of males, for experts.
There are cars, motors, light industrial vehicles and weights.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes account of the reparation time estimated by the manufacturer or the painting barms.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5,75, for customers who use it shortly, ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which performed thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the mount chain, only thanks to his chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the vessels of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the Internet professional sector that allows to investigate skilled vehicles.
His statistics service is very useful to identify trends, to realize geo-demographical analysis or to know current problems by mark or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a determined mark are moved to the garage for a pan or how serious wrongs have occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as an access to parts, prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of males, panes or defying.
The evaluation GT guide is an historical market reference product.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
His business volume has increased by 20% per year in the last three years, and it has made a business rate of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.

Garage duties in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a duty in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the rechange room, create a duty and generate it.
The use facility is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals that are re-use to new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourists, 109 all-territories, 137 motes, 78 bragonets and 44 cars.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to repair is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model concerned appears then the necessary part is selected.
The user may include variables such as the work hand price, majority or reduction, then it can print the duty to give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an exhibition tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the garage destination does not include the estimated work time.
The use cost of this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be subject to a credit.
Today, the Audatex company works so that these images are in three sizes.
This is an innovation that the mechanicals see a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and to turn it to see the internal face.
