The diploma, the medalla and the cheque of $1,4 million will receive them, inter alia, for the exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will come to the Norwegian Metrópolis in the morning and they'll have to do much.
First, visiting the Nobel Institute, where it will first be found with the five members of the Committee that, in October, elected 172 people and 33 organizations.
Then the presidential couple has planned a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and the Queen Sonia.
Last night the visit will collect with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious galardon.
It shall be the fourth President of the United States receiving it, although the third receiving it in his office.
The White House has already announced that when receiving the prize, he will speak of the Afghan war.

His war efforts continued to increase with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which would not forget to mention any of its critics.
In the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish coronas (approximately 24 million Czech Koreans).
It is proposed to give them caritative para finances, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During its complete programme, the President and his wife will participate in a bank which will, in addition to the Norwegian kings, hear the first minister and 250 other invited persons.
Obama since the beginning had a better preserved attitude towards the premises.
He mentioned, for example, having the sense of not worth it all.
He also repeated several times that the premium is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as he.
Soon after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".

Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the burn
In Praga, citizens can separate the drinking packages and in the southern villages of Moravia can be found containers to separate snake by all sides.
And in Brno?
Alliance needs a few minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno it's not separated for nothing.
I think that, to be the second largest city of the Republic, attendances are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is fully late in the separation of powders, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, view and plastic, but especially by the number of containers for these waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to take a PET box in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially long time and patient requires.
The only place I've found until now is in the Moravské Beach nomśsti, in front of the Power Huse.
That you don't hate Mr. Subka and your companions with me, but this seems too little.
It is not necessary to mention that, in other parts, it is not easy to separate the burden.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
Per vacance
What happens is that containers are far away.
It's not surprising.
I offered myself, after a party, to take the bathroom several glass and plastic bottles.
But in Calle Kaunicova, I saw no red container near.
Happily, I found the right place.
However, the shooting was already removed from the container.
It is still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecological and ethical seem not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy you to the city the extralink of hockey, which is hungry to us in the whole Republic, and not buy any more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to compare my hypothesis, after navigating on the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to the EKO-COM society, Brno is indeed the worst of all the Jihomoravskī kraj region.
The 'Parroubek' budget dismissed money from income and disease subsidies
After the left, despite the Government's view, funds for farmers or officials may be added, there may be no enough money for the budget, ill-supports or for the construction shore.
But not even for the interests of the State or international debt.
This will harm all those ruling in the second half of the year that come, says the Minister of Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase in some groups, they believed that the government potentially requested a loan for sensitive, income or insurance of disease expenditure. "This is only to put the problems for the future, it is to put mines", says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is taken, it is necessary to pay more interests and, at one time, the money must be returned.
The State does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or functional expenditure of the State, taxes must be increased.
To all who have added the left now: the bombs, teachers, farmers.
And later, also your children.
People don't need to worry about the income or subsidies of disease, they will receive them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in the public debt; the year that will not be lacked in the treasure only will be 163 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will not be slowly increased by VAT or reduced maternity subsidies, as the Government has done in its package against deficit.
As a result of the displacements of the money in benefit of some election groups, the year that will be also missed will also be $5 billion to end the construction of cars and railers.
It is mainly the sectors in which the offer has already been held and where the construction process has already started, whose projects cannot be changed and cannot be reduced.
The maximum you can do is keep them, what is not free.
This means the delay or stop of the thirty major buildings; the possibility of reaching European funds is also in danger, warns the carport of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
✔SSD proposed a salmonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the switch dividers, which is mostly ownership of the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividing never is safe or is a shock without shock.
Last year, the twenty-five million were allocated to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are liquided by environmental damages, serve to complete the account for revenue or serve as a reserve for the prepared restructuring of revenue.
In addition, in accordance with the EU rules, it increases the real deficit of the budget at 5,7% of the GDP.
The carnaval of money transfers does not end here.
About 3 billion million were obtained from the budget to grant a variety of compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or for the cost of crimes, including in the shore of construction.
It is not clear if the State needs these funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international struggle, we may have to pay it, Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to pay money within the resort or, in the worst cases, to escape the reserve of the Government ' s budget.
They are also missing 100 million for the Statni pocladna project (Statni pocladna), whose price is of two billion and has been already started. You must allow monitoring online in which different authorities are expenditure.
The first stage began in January.
If the Hacienda Minister does not find money on the other hand, the project will have to stop and reach sanctions, warn Janota.
Your future smart phone can work with two operational systems
The US will contain a mobile phone where the user can, by clicking on a key, change between several operational systems.
The discovered plans are voting promisers.
Only clicking a key, you go into a few seconds of Windows Mobile to Android.
Only this possibility is the target of the United States VMware company, which is focused on the development of the virtual software for computers.
In your mobile, you can take two user profiles the same time.
They can change between them and share them between home and work.
They operate at the same time, Mrs. Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for the computer magazine world.
It was presented in November of the last year, and a few days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be started in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer fiction.
VMware has shown successfully the journalists how the smartphone works with two operational systems.
It was the N800 Nokia, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technologie for mobile phones is in its support.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to make evidence of virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotels
Not only television maintainers in Krkonoše are worried about the swimming clouds.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but it is still scared of booking with commitment.
And if they call us, ask them immediately about our view, if these Navities will have nest or bar", said the mainteneur of the Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindlerヴ Mløn a Nochevieja according to their expectations, they should not be doubted more in reserving the stay.
Those who prefer to burn the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, they can try to wait for more days.
The hotels of Špindleräv Mløn offer all weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer, but they will soon fall and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, and Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabi travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all the winter dates.
Now what's more interested is the shipment week, which is not yet complete.
The half of the places offered remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some last shipping stays," said the Ingtours Petr Schiffert director.
Vrchlabí’s travel agency can also offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are less free places.
The first 14 days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are regularly sold.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkronoše.
People are waiting to see if there's noise.
No one wants to pass the end of the year on the mountain without darkness.
If the skins remain swimming during the week, the date of Christmas will also be exhausted," Schifert believes.
On the contrary, it is a little more easy to take the rooms in the Horizont Hotel in Pec Pod Snśkou; the last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For the Event and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increased during the Polish holidays in January and February also is sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The eighth percent of Nochevieja stays are already busy in the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking in Janské Láznō.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel of Janské Láznś in Christmas the half of the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, because we found about 60 percent of the occupational capacity.
Feb has been a bit more weak, but as a black cage, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will be safely increased, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
However, at the moment it seems to be the Krkonoše hotels will pass the swimming wines waiting for them.
The juvenile must fall the temperatures and, if there are precipitations, the mountains should be nervous.
But after again the temperatures will be up, Jiśí Jakubský of Hradec Kralové, from the Water Meteorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is cooke that Barack Obama, the President with the most intelligent man's reputation, as a diligent student repeated in the issue, afghan the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected with anxiety, it was shown that it was a copy of the guide used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the termination "equivalent to in Iraq", but it was not able to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
He himself, who had three years ago criticized Bush's idea to send new military reliefs to Iraq, the country suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as “unresponsive and catastrophic consequences”.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on field capital recommendations, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is talking about Iraq in news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however, objectively left his successor a very much more favourable starting situation than it had to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
The field captains returned to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the chief of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even though the traditional subordinated relationships were undermined by the undetermined shuttleers in the White House to a hard criticism.
He requested 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The Chairman slaughtered for three months, but there was nothing better to happen, so at least he inflicted the general over 10,000 military.
It has achieved that Europe would promise you more than 5,000, although he had previously contained with at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be its goal, starting to retire the Afghanian troops in 18 months and end this procedure in three years. All of Obama’s doctrine generated more questions from the answers offered.
Many doubt that the increase is the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the frastricted wars in the past few years, the society of Iraq is relatively well-organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and is not fulfilled with any agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are adjusted to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin and will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
Equilibration of interests from different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establish a state that is "action capability", a minimum goal of all operations, seems very real.
The horizon of the Obama Strategy for its voluntaryism.
During the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to be weak, and now it is on the point of stealing.
Only a Romantic soul, who doesn't know anything of the reality, can believe that the militarys sent to war so that they "return soon to home" will make any miracle here.
From the political point of view, the date of the retirement of the troops is purely irresponsibility, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirect statement of the US derogation.
The last summit of the OTAN has demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and they don't want to explain their electors, what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which is rootly able to affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to impede and the increased sanctions do not exercise any effect on Iran, the U.S. should take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers exactly when, according to Obama, America starts the triunphal retirement of the armies of Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic revision for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that there is no three years for the presidential elections and therefore there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this results in total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will not be re-effectively obtained by the bonus
The US Goldman Sachs executives will not receive the goods in effectiveness this year.
The entity announced it to react to the duration of its salary practices.
The group of 30 guidelines shall receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Moreover, actions may be removed if they had taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs became leader in the effort to join the bonus in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I think that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to be undertaken, mentioned the former banking banker of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott entity.
The problem is in details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank was criticized after having almost $17.000 million (orly $300,000) for bonuss, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonus in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters Agency, probably exceeds, despite the today announced measure of $20,000.
High bonus in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate topic in policy.
The Great Britain announced Monday that he plans to write only one time, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuss for bankers that exceed 25,000 litres (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
Women received the Nobel Prizes in all less physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm's hands of King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized and literature categories.
In addition to the four sciences, he also set a German writer of Roman origin, Herta Muller, among the premises.
The Nobel Medical Prize received him two US Biologists, Elizabeth Second and Carol Greider, as well as his companion Jack Szostak for the research on the field of chromosome.
The Nobel in the chemical received the Israelite Ada Jonath and the United States Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosome.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize of Economy, received him the United States Elinor Ostrom and his companion Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a premised woman, was Physical.
This prize received it today by the scientists Charles Kao for the research on the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which represents the basis of all digital, fax or telescope cameras.
Each prize collected the diploma, Nobel's medal and the cash certificate.
This sum in each category is from up to ten million Swedish coronas (approximately 25 million Czech Koreans).
In the case of several premiums in each category, the premium shall be paid between it.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace, received it tonight in Oslo, Norway, the US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy that he had been premised, since it is found at the start of his car and is also the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, to defend its policy, he added that wars are essential in certain situations to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the division. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to the Minister of Hacienda Eduard Janota, who is planned to remain in the Government, since it is not in accordance with the State budget version for the year coming, adopted the Monday by the Chamber of Members.
The budget, and may also Janota's stay in the office, will be the items of its Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the quote, he informed President Radin Ochvat's portal.
About his continuity in the role, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Republic of Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 million Koreans.
However, the Chamber of Members adopted the left proposals for fund transfers and increased the money for staff loans, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in line with the social-democratic proposals, since it is incredible that it increases budgetary deficit.
Among the left side and the government, Klaus and the right one, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. As a result of this conflict, the future activities of the Fisher Bureau office, which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ✔SSD and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, in the version adopted by the parliamentary chamber, actually liquids the pack of ahorrate measures imposed by the Government of Fisher to swallow public debt.
Klaus may but must not sign the State budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with employees that politicians had long-term disappointing "the serious problem," namely, "the non-sufficient deficit" of the public facility.
He said he has no longer a good solution today.
Only a strong government that can be supported in a broader consensus between the political parties could improve this situation, believes the President.
The ODS Mirec Topolánek leader mentioned that the budget is awesome and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of ODS, ODS and the Greens is obviously not already working.
The first minister Fischer reacted and qualified similar words of "forced feelings".
The head of ŠSSD, Jiśí Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is amazing, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will overcome the 20 million colonies.
Wednesday, SSD said that the adoption of the State budget for the year that has been successful.
The people were also content.
Mandala in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new film of Hollywood, Invitus: Invencible, tells much about the country, their fight and victory, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play the American actors.
The story speaks of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The incansable fighter against the racist apartment regime in South Africa and his first black President Nelson Mandela is interpreted in its biography by the American actor of a Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role to play Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret, I have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy and two years, receiving the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama over the world of the Millennium Dollar Bay, played the role of the leader of the movement by aboling the slavery, who had been slave, from the President of the United States, and even God in Evan All Power. But rarely represented someone who still lived and, for many people, is so important as Mandela.
The former South African statist passed 27 years in prison for its activities to end the apartment in the South African Republic.
It was put in freedom in 1990 and for four years became President of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invitus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was talking like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African Ruby team, Francois Pienar, to help join the country. Mandela, the new President, knows that after the apartment of its nation remains racial and economically separated.
It believes that it is able to join his people through sports, and therefore it is decided to join the players of Ruby, which belong to the outsides worldwide.
South African team reached the World Copa in 1995.
Freeman worked several years so that Mandela's history comes to the Chineses.
I had no other goal to play this role so that it was the most likely to realise, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world policy were out of the same area, he had tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be between pustiers before his speech.
The most important was that I wanted to stretch his hand to Mandela.
I found that when I cut his hand, I received your energy, this is transmitted and I had the sense of knowing how you feel, said.
For me, it's important to try to turn me into a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienar, the captain of the National Rurby Team, where the white players were predominant.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rumby.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met first time with Pienar in his house.
I remember calling to the door, he opened and the first thing I told to François Pienar in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the persons of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Eastwood Director, Invitus: Invencible received positive comments and is also talking about ambitions for Oscar.
The cine criticy of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invitus received a hundred percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendor on Norway resolved: the Russians made evidence of a mix
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Defence Minister has concluded yesterday that near the borders with Norway made evidence of a Baltic intercontinental mix.
The launch again failed. The mixel, type of "Bulava", previously intended to be the fiery of Russian army, is converting into the beach of the Russian Generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the tests of the mixel has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, has not been flying or unexpected in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is written as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but light.
During the 13th test, there was no problem at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, new technical problems occurred on the device.
The engine probably stored in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was frozen in the White Sea.
This type of mixture may be launched from a ship that is moved and is summered at once.
That is why it is likely that the mystery light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flight object, actually out of the failure "Bulava".
The Norwegians equivalent since the first time were not delayed by the treatment of a Russian missile.
Generals this time are defended by claiming that it is not simply possible to speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the mixel were overseas and the ship was held in the third.
In previous cases, motors were immediately experienced in the first stage.
Although no launch was completely interrupted without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirty failed.
The success of almost 50 percent filled with optimism to the generals and therefore continues to say that "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even reach to ten nuclear hyperonic blocks, the total total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA of Moscow in the 51 years
Legendary Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey meeting for 51 years.
The former world's camp, olympic and winner of the Copa Stanley will help your CSKA Moscú team and may play the Wednesday in the KHL village against San Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of 40 years in 1998 and currently presided CSKA.
After Denis Kuyash has been hurt, we need urgently another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practiced and has been commitmented to help the team.
We only need to solve some formal matters, quoted the AP Agency in Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of Moscú Club.
It is still not clear if the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can get up the soul of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice pit, it will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
Legendary of Gordoe Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of 50 and a year during the whole time, and reached 15 goals and 26 assistance.

Since 2001 it is a member of the Hockey Gloria Room.
Hyundai complied with the requirements of the sindicates. It will cancel all the additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed to cancel all the additional work.
Only through the frequent additional work, the trademans declared the emergency for the Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanśk, the port of the Hyundai car manufacturer.
The direction, however, wants to agree with the trade unions for this year more Saturday round.
We cannot resign our manufacturing plan because it is essential. That is why we propose voluntary voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, i.e., it will work in two tours, said Vanōk.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday round.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday 28 November.
According to Vaśka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can cover the bonus for additional hours or may take a free day on 28 December, i.e., a day of long-term shipping feasts, mentioned Vanśk.
Furthermore, all workers of the Sunday tours will receive money for travel and food.
Since the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints of the sindicalists and routineists, which stopped the manufacture last week, the address last night decided to immediately cancel all the additional work for December, mentioned Vanōk.
Employees of the car factory were obliged to work over two hours more than eight hours, and this situation was almost every day until last week.
After the signing of the agreement, the trade unions shall cancel the emergency of the shipping.
Another negotiation between the manufacture direction and the sindicalists must be held tomorrow.
The chief of the workshops Petr Kuchaś said on Wednesday, that if they were commitmented to comply with the requirements and to sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by shock.
The situation in the car factory was aggressive last Week, when about 400 employees spontaneously entered into a chain for the frequent additional work.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and the smooth.
The address considered that employees had to work for additional hours to meet the requirements and to provide cars.
The sindicalists in their statement of the emergency by the moon, also required no employee, which the past Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, were somewhat penalized.
As regards supplementary work, trade unions require a reduction in the company at least.
Furthermore, this year requires a reward of 5,000 colonies for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai is currently 2.000 employees.
The manufacture was started last November.
Up to September, about 80,000 cars were produced; its current production potential is of 200,000 cars per year.
Checa discovery: an effective substance until HIV's 'callered' virus
The Czech and German scientist team makes evidence of new compositions to modify HIV propagation in the organ
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drugs resistant viruses.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of virus, as well as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS can not be curated until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV virus replication in the body.
However, your use has many secondary effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely eliminated, anti-resistent viruses will be created; against them, the medicines do not work.
The work of experts from the three Institutes of the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic, VSCHCHT Praga and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metabolism have an impact on the album, responsible for the dissemination of HIV virus.
The metabolisms are composed of bown, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compositions block the propagation of the virus in a different way than all the medicines currently used, and so they can solve resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, “measured” composed, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus album.
Metadatabolans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyeder jaulas composed of bow, hydrogen and carbon atoms are combined by metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A trailer and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is a HIV virus album, and is essential for the vital cycle of virus.
Without HIV protection, HIV virus fraction is not produced and would not be created matures and infected tumors of the virus.
If we stop HIV-protections, we also stop the dissemination of the virus in the body of the patient, scientists are explaining in a press news published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemology in the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic.
In a article published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of jaulas (see table) are united by a short organic series that continues to be systematically modified.
A little more weak, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in probeta, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metabolisms in the common enzim variant is not so strong as in clinically used medicines, but do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicinal products often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualitys such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes, that metamarbolans are interesting in research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlin śáčova, the head of the laboratory of the structural biology in the Institute of Organic and Biological Chemical Chemistry and the Institute of molecular Genetics in the Science Academy.
The ODS attacked Fisher, he defends himself
ODS Mirec Topolánek said that the budget adopted for the year that comes is "spanned" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, consider its future existence.
The Declarations of ODS were indicated by the First Minister as strong judgments.
They say the time is left for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with support of SSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously not already working.
According to Nečas, the first minister must decide whether in the chamber of deputy wants to be supported in minority, trying to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his position with the support of the left parliamentary.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The Chamber of Members last night adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the left amended proposals for more than 12 billion colonies.
The Chamber of Members increased the money for state officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government reaffirmed the ODS proposals, as the budget deficit was fully increased.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion colonies.
Before the vote, ODS went out of the room and thus complied with the Government ' s desire, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Delusion and inutility
The Minister of Hacienda, Eduard Janota, talked about the distress and feeling of inutility; the first minister Jan Fischer said that the government will return to assess the current situation.
Nevertheless it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened the division in the case of the amending proposals, the situation could be different.
According to śeská TV, Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He marked, you're thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is that it is for its disappointment for the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the Government, he has nothing to do with the designated by the SSD, which implies the changes in the budget.
The first minister should also clearly say, if it deems, if the camera approve other laws that increase the deficit, for example, those relating to subventions in disease, refunds, or amendment of the Service Act.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing bad, underlined Topolánek in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministers in local posts there are people belonging to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if fisher decided to resign the principle of the struggle with the deficit of the public facility, "is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputy".
However, it is not possible to contain support and tolerance of ODS members.
I did not think about that, when it is the moment, I will take care of this, said to the journalists in the chamber of Members the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, which was appointed for the government exactly by the ODS members.
The first Minister Fischer came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS held on request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that the Sunday in the chamber of deputy would probably vote against the amended budget if the first minister did not request explicitly the ODS Members to allow the budget acceptance.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the party head in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't know that my vote was missing.
By demitting the mandate, I knew that in the next months the chamber of defence and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek reacted itself.

The Mindanao island also operates Muslim separators.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine Government.
The history of RSA refers to the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, in the United States, a new film of Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invitus (the official title in Checo is Invitus: Neporaśenī), which captures a part of the biography of the former President of South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of the worldwidely known fighter against the apartment plays Morgan Freeman, who has chosen years ago for the protagonist role Mandela.
The second paper, the Legendary Champion in Ruby Francoise Pienar, interpreted it Matt Damon.
With the star, the reactions of the critics and the public
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
His complete name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988, the Sacharov Prize received for the freedom of thinking, in 1993, near Klerk, the Nobel Prize of Peace.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the 1994-1999 years.
Successful hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa prepared for the World Championship in Futball, the media are at the same time stressed by alarming news about the growing racial hate and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the most black dominant.
According to the AP News Agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist papers by the "some interesting" stars of Hollywood.
Morgan Freeman, however, says that he's proud of the new film.
For many years, I was dreaming with the role, and I was well prepared to play it.
Sometimes I found me in a person with Nelson Mandela, as it says - to cover your energy, mentioned in an interview after the festival star in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember the character and message of Mandela through the film.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, added.
In the clothing of the national rouby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game born the nation. Retratour to the South African lawyer of human rights during his first electionary period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to join two groups of people, racially and for years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also a protagonist of the South African national rouby team and joined the game field. RSA wins the world cook.
By entering the gram into the clothes, which is considered in RSA as something almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations, especially all of the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The fútbol campion may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the rouby player Chester Williams, the only "nick" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the situation in the RSA.
The South Africans, however, are sceptic, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rouby Christopher Dawson, who flew from his country to Britain.
The campaign started on 11 June 2010.
In Luunsko a transformer with a value of tens of millions of columns
The fire has shooted a transformer of the company śeps in a box of interruptor near the village of Vøškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the bomb pool of the Usti region is extensive by six groups.
Before the bombs wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed the opinion and the fire is extented with a mixture of water, spum and a special extractor material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the circumcision of the transformer.
There were no wounds, according to Pavla Mandatova, the company's voice, but had not put it in danger the security operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of a number of millions of corones, listing it is not exactly possible before the fire is removed.
According to Mandatova, the transformer will be replaced by a new transformer.
During the ten years of the activity of śeps did not happen anything similar, the notices of this type are sporáctic, added.
According to Sona Holingerova Hendrychov, the switch of the society slaughter for the northern Chequia, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of the electric substance did not affect homes, offices and companies.

Jančura will submit a complaint by calumnia to three themes of sSD
The owner of the Radim Jančura Agency will today submit a calumnia complaint to three social democratic themes.
This is the Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubickī kraj and the theman of Olomouckī kraj Martin Tesaśík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty-minutes in Radiośurnal.
The request must be addressed with the firm's efforts, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions have been signing long-term contracts with śeské Drahy.
All three diamonds are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "we're going to pass the past," but we've only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more precious than śeské drapy, which is not true. We know the prices of śeské Drahy, which were fixed last week.
So there's no other thing to defend us.
It is through the calumnia towards the University Agency, said to Radiośurnal Jančura.
He mentioned the tests of all regions, and it has not taken necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of the medial show of Mr Jančura, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I'm prepared to defend my good reputation and my region, and I call on the other themes that they do.
I think that also will be clearly shown, that Mr Jančura handle the public in the matter of the regional rail transport, and use false and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced the last week, which would invest a number of millions of Koreans in the advertising, whose aim would be to warn these measures in the regions.
Radiośurnal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue to continue after the new Year.
He needed that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura initiated the campaign after the regions agreed with Drahy in maintaining regional rail links and at about 150 billion colonies, they did not convoke a tender.
According to Jančura's similar steps, the law and the opinion of the European Court is in a disagreement.
Jančura states that he has been threatened by a Member of SSD, due to its criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can lose bus license.
It was presented as a deputy from SSD, I know, what is the matter, and I will not say his name, said Jančura today for Radioṣṭurnal.
The neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The neumococal vaccine from January will end the habitual habitats.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time.
However, there are opinions that the obligatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against niumocotics culminate.
The Medicine Institute is already fixing the maximum vaccines prices that will be covered by the insurance companies.
The experts have already clearly been in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January to January the neumococal vaccine may receive children born from 2 August of the last year.
The condition is not receiving any dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, they must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age.
Last year the fourth part of the families left volunteerly vacuum against their children.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 corones and more.
In order to vaccinate the smaller children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will cost in vaccines from 300 to 450 000 coronas annually.
Without shock, the treatment will be shocked, which is necessary for non-vacuumed children.
Eventually, the state has spent about 5000,000 annually invasion of children.
The covered vaccination was started by the named Janota package.
Neumococ is the cause of media otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From neumococal infections in our country each year, 28 children older than 10 years of age died according to investigations in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neumoccal vaccine covered in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be obliged?
However, it appears that this vaccine could be binding in the future.
From January must be covered by the insurance and voluntary companies.
The obligatory vaccine would be better, for example, marked by Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civilian association Nahlas.
Its association has spread the neumococal vaccines for many years.
Experts at a international conference in which our association had participated were not fully satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to do now, mentioned Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neumocoics.
At this moment we did not think about it as absolutely, said his Vlastimil Sscheу.
Voluntary vaccine has its defects, claims doctors
The Chairman of the Odborná pediactors society společnost practticæch dætskæch lekaś Hana Cabrnochova acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its defects.
If all children receive the vaccine, it can be reasoned about the reduction of the dose number. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnochova.
Experts hope that from the year that more than 80 percent of youth parents are going to take vacuum against their children.
The neumococal vaccine is also a great change because, as the first vaccination in children is covered by healthy companies, not by state.
Insurance companies should pay more money in the profileaxis, so that the treatment is later, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediactors are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by the insurance companies and distributed to the doctors, as if the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that the insurance companies could "have the money of health insurance".
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that the pediactors will invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a notable sum.
It'll be nothing easy, says Cabrnochov.
The son of a American artist involved "in the rob of a museum"
The son of the renomeed American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal a valuable painting in $20 million (12 million) of his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police states that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 squares in his vehicle and its remolque.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a scavator to smile in the museum, in the region of the Pocon Mountains.
Fracetta father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of persons such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Agency of News Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the moment of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family debate could have motivated the young Frazetta.
The Agency reported that the 52-year-old child, Frazatta son, declared to the police that his father had commanded him "in the museum for any means to transfer all tables to a deposit."
The Agency said that Frazetta's father refused to have granted such permission.
Labour party defence tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure in the pre-budgetary report, against the criticism of opposition, business and trade.
Conservers said that Alistair Darling "dispersed" was an opportunity to show their seriousness on the recovery of the disability, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Hacienda has also been critical because of the damage to workers of low and mediumsized income.
Among its main proposals are 0.5 per cent of the social security expenditure and 1 per cent of the payment agreements of the public sector since 2011.
Cooperation for Social Security
Syndicates regret that workers with low salary were punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in the social security expenditure, which will grow around 3 billion libraries per year, has inflicted the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who win more than 20,000 £ per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
CLAVES OF THE ANTERIAL INFORM AUTHORISATION
Social security with an increase of 0.5 per cent from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected 4,75 % this year
New tax of 50% on the banks
The expenditure of 1 point of the tax on society for small signs was deleted
Taxes for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the Hacienda Ministry, a person who wins £ 30,000 will lose 90 £ per year and who won £ 40,000 will lose £ 190 while a person who wins £ 10,000 per year will win £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal to reduce half the deficit for 2013 implies " hard decisions", but they stressed that 60 per cent of the additional tax load would result in 5 per cent of the higher payments.
The Minister of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, refused that tax expenditure and delineed expenditure would be a "grain of sand in the wilderness" compared with what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," said the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would return to the end of the year.
However, the workshop's prognostics regarding the future economic growth, which will influence the amount to request and the rapidity of the deficit, were doubted after the Minister of Hacienda had been obliged to change the first figures.
In its statement, it stated that the economy would probably be at 4,75 % this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5 % pronosticed in April, while the claim of loans would be 3 billion £ above the previous estimated.
"Opportunity dispersed"
The Conservators, who will start a new campaign to publish the juvenile, warning about "the debt crisis" of the workshop party, said that the projection of claims for $789 million for the next six years was insufficient.
The Ministers failed to present a credible plan on the way they returned money, accompanied, "cinically" by means of the difficult options until the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Hacienda Ministry, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and have dispersed it."
"All important advertisements will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloite
The laborist party emphasizes that schools, hospitals and the police of future currency will be protected, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a higher deficit reduction in shorter timely deficit.
However, the Democratic Liberals claimed that the money recovered by tax increases and expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that projects would be as "sanecastles".
BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for advertising, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies for incapacity in April next, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Hacienda exposed to the accused of election manuscripts, since the money could just be recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that the most people are providing it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure data later to 2011, the economics said that the adjustment of the public expenditure would only be felt in a medium term.
The Honoured Institute of Fiscal Studies said that Hacienda's Minister had involved substantial recovery in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really placing pain for further." said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important advertisements will come after the election, who won't win", added Roger Bootle, economic adviser of the Deloite accounters.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are taking account of this."
The FBI is in charge of the United States detention in Pakistan.
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five suspected US men of extremist connections.
The American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a house in Sarhoda, the Eastern Province of Punjab.
The FBI said he's investigating whether they're the same men who lost their homes in the state of Virginia, the United States, last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
Three of them are of Pakistani descendants, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemenite origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course we're very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are retaining," said the portal, Ian Kelly.
The portfolio of the FBI, Katherine Schwi, said that the Agency was in knowledge of the detention and that he was in contact with the families of lost students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and nature of their business there, if in these cases are students who were gone," said the portavoz.
The Pakistani Ambassador in Washington said the men were detained in a house that belongs to the boy of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that there had not yet been responsibilities against detention.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on detention, informed the Reuters news agency; but he said that the United States had to "work closerly with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eliminate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to be recruited and trained."
The family of the five students declared their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
International Amnistia condemned "abuses" of Iran
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equal to disabilities, according to a report of the International Amnesty Group.
The detailed report of the regime 'the models of abuse' before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man mentioned in the report said they had shocked him and shooted with cigarettes, and another said they threatened him by violating him.
Iran has rejected previous critics of its human rights history.
The officials have said that such critics have a political foundation.
Thousands of arrested people and the decades killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinjad caused the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Decades of persons have been sentenced, and fiscals claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
The BBC Correspondent in Teheran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some abuse accused, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak's detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards the critics, according to our corresponsal.
"Falsa Confidence"
Amnistía International quoted the report of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who stated that he was accused of “working with the Facebook networks” and protesting against the result of the elections.
"That often shoot me in the face," according to his words.
"I wasn't shocked with cigarettes under the eyes, in the head, the head... they brought me up and humiliated."
Amnistia said that after five days he signed a false confesion, they solved it and left on the street, still blooding and semiconcing.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some detained protesters had been tortured until the death in prison and others were violated.
Iranian officials refused the accused of violation, but they acknowledged that there were abuses.
Amnistia also quoted the case of an former detention, who stated that they returned to a container together with 75 people over eight weeks in a prison centre in Kahrizak.
Amnistia acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authority had established committees to investigate the deterioration of the post and response of the Government, but said that the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the comments of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent more manifestations.
A ski track was done in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol's interest site into a competitive track.
The Pista at the park event led to 16 semiprofesional and snowboarders that compounded by premises in effectiveness.
At the top of the pendant in the Brandon Hill park, there was a short salt lamp before a track of 100 meters of length.
John Hickman, a four-year-old medical student, said that he had a beautiful view from the top of the track, but he was quite atmosphere.
It looks under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titilating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the gate, true talent", added.
The premiums were delivered to the best trucks or manipulations carried out on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the nest will be left.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested to prohibit the construction of minerals and in which there is a general warning on the subject of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, wrote a detailed and studyed report on the possible integration of the musulmans (which is actually integrated) in one of the most openly lack of societys of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author "Why the French don't Like Headcarves" (2006), a elegant and detailed study of a problem that shared and concerned the country for a decade and average, and whose effects are still understood today.
The last book of Mr Bowen has a broader and ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropolog, he wants to know not only what political and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
Last month in mixes, schools and institutions that now provide 5-6 million French musulmans as Mr. Bowen is called "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener that plays discussions between teachers and students about questions more interesting.
Should a Muslim marry in a mixed or in a mixture (or both)?
Should young musulmans teach them about the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man not musulman?
Is it legitimate that a musulman uses a banking system based on interests to obtain hypothesis?
These are apparently worldwide issues, support, things of daily life, which concern the means more than the political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of believers, teachers and intellectual, not one of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab scholar of Islam born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good musulman and a good citizen in a modern laica society.
You can't extend this argument completely.
The conservators doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thoughters and activistas that Mr. Bowen interviews have to be disappointed with its honourists of Salafi, partisans of the Sunni Islamian purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who are currently with a small but influenced presence among the musulmans of Europe.
Bowen believes that the musulman values and the French laics may be compatible.
But adjustment requires mutual concessions.
It questions what point the French political stresses (and the intellectual eleite that so ferously defends the laicsm) are truly compromised with pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have an injusticeful treatment than Catholic, protesters and Jewish, who have also had to do their historical commitments with the Layd Republicism.
More than a growing pragmaticism, it means "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one wants to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolidating panorama
Arctics are changing more fast and more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet.
The ice that defines it is declining to an alarming speed, bringing with you life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters with diplomatic, lawyers and now authors as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" (On Thin Ice) Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, draws a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bird.
Knower of the complex history and the policy of the ball castle, describes the long tradition of Arctic operators, which gave tests of value infringing the white bone.
The meeting of the almirant Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old chain, fighting only with the extreme of his mosquet, is certainly a mito, but others are real.
The crys, captured while the bodys of their recent exterminated mothers were arrested and sent to zoological and circles.
A circle presentation at the beginning of the XX century showed 75 polar bones at the same time.
Even today, zoological rings are generally a millionary part of the area of a sacred adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar polar in Singapore is green by the algas that grow in the areas without its snake.

Ellis recurs the reports of other writers and historians, and often turns back to the threat that the cazators present the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues to be in Groenland and Canada, where helicopters and skimmers in motorways use high power shoot shuttles to defeat their charges.
Ironically, it is in the waters toward the north of those two castle nations where the ice will last more time.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an old editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scattering story about the Arctic science and a supermarkant view of how to transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
No atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can correctly explain the speed of changes.
It's not because of lack of effort.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 19th century gave indications for the first time about the movement of the ice mass.
Then the cold war submarines traced a map of the ice swimming shoes that circulated under the ice mass.
Satellite exploitations and the extensive series of iceberg sounds mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant people camped on the flight still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, a reduced world of the afluent system within the arctic ice, formed by salin water chrorrites that is composed while frozen.
But from the skin on the surface to the wonders of the internal microscopics, they're all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen in some moment between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, we could be us.
Marines between 6.000 putting coronas on Arlington's tubs
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours in bus to put a single coron in the tube of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines that traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., at the Arlington National Cementary to decourage tumbs, it was a day to make a honour to men and women who once were on their boards.
In a few months, from where we're shipping, we could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so I'd just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered the Saturday morning to put corones on the shoes of the veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cementary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of tumbs in the Arlington Cementary.
In what is already a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen traveled each year and stop in different cities along the road to offer events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16.000 corones in the cementary of Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, tumbs at the Fayetteville National Cementary in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the Memorial site of the United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the colonies.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said that he traveled to Arlington in honor to his husband, a military defeated car.
While his husband was not sepulated in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to give a reward to those who sacrificed.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he stated.
It's like visiting a family tumb.
The volunteers walked in calied clothes, through the wide beaches and collines of the cementary.
Volunteers were directed to the oldest tumbs of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnamian war, because they did not receive so many visits as new tumbs, said the organizations.
The atmosphere was joyful while children played, and the couples were taken from the hand, while they took the fresh pipe to the sepulcral lambs.
Each circle corne was a deep green, with a small red lazo acted on the top side.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most veterans of Iraq and Afghan wars are settled, it was virtually silenced.
The United Service Organizations (United Service Association for Soldiers) gave 1.000 colonies to decoration the section, but the summer atmosphere of the present wars invaded the area.
People smile openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported one another in the glass air.
Some read in a high voice screamed names on the stones, while others were swing to see small white and black plates put inside the shooting bar, for those who were still not completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who smiled the laughs of their eyes in front of your son's tub.
He handed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit Sgto Sea artillery. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
Nobody should forget why we're free... my son paid for it, said.
"More after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested an American government contractor
The Cuban Government has stopped an U.S. government contractor who distributed mobiles and portal computers in the country and said that the officials of the Department of State were Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Inc Development, with seat in Bethesda.
The company works on customer projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officials together with the United States Interests Section in Habana are looking for access to the detention, which was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although in accordance with the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested by almost anything that is considered "the danger".
All anti-revolutionary activities, including less and critical protests, include the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a incredible blogger community, directed by the popular commentary Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how it and her husband are followers and joined by government agents.
Sánchez has requested a number of permissions to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been rejected.
Detention of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the Communist Government of Castro brothers in Cuba and Obama administration, which has been looking for a "low ritmo" approach to improving the relationship with the island.
The New York Times was the first to tell the arrest news on Wednesday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisons and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobile and portable computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new and codified in a country where the average payment of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government granted regular citizens the right to purchase mobiles only this year; especially for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost daily payment.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in cheap hotels and for for foreign visitors in the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a US in Cuba is inusual.
Gloria Berbena, officer of the United States Interests Section in La Habana, said that most American citizens in the prison in Cuba are among crimes such as drug trafficking.
Bebena said that he couldn't provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly discertified.
A activities in any other open society would be legal, as to distribute free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the United States's Human Rights Organization, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba," a reference to Raúl Castro's place as a leader of the country, to replace his sister, Brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused is often detained, processed and incarcerated in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials develop a complement to send men to Afghanistan
The Saturday, Pakistani authorities have neutralized the brain of a compliment to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the United States troops, showing that the case can help to develop a broad network of terrorist reclusters, which calls Internet on the search of young people radicalized.
The investigators said they were persecuting a mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after finding that one of them made comments by approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Safullah directed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the Pakistani tribal cities, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist training fields.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, showed the Sabfullah Saturday that he couldn't convince the Qaeda's commanders that men were not part of a CIA compliment to be infiltrated in the terrorist network.
It was therefore isolated for several days in the Eastern city of Sargodha, far from the northeastern mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an incubiered operation.
For this reason, it was rejected by the officer, who spoke from the anonymed due to the delicateness of the case.
The officer said that men did not change and even were trying to get the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda fields when Pakistani police officials arrested them.
The case of the five men who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI, stresses the critical role of the recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and, perhaps, the most important thing is, they determine who are trustful.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States intelligence has been the main priority to treat infiltration of people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not let those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spacious.
Analysts said that Qaeda analyzes with special attention to the aspirant American recruitments.
But for the organization, they are a huge atractive because of their potential to access United States targets and because of the value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based on the United States, said that terrorist groups have also come to much more careful in recent years with respect to those who admitte, because the United States Intelligence Agencys have been expert on their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recrutement model what many have already followed? Kohlmann showed.
It has been transformed into a model that is much more based on the web.
Decades of thousands of protest in Copenhagen, demand "climical" action
The Saturday tens of thousands of manifestants walked here through the streets, demanding negotiators working in the Beauta Convention Center of the city, the most authentic actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a pugnate of massed activists put small explosives near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
In a day on which little occurred in the discussions about the United Nations climate, thousands of activists walked through the city by supporting pancards in English that said "No planet B" and one in Spanish, which stated, "The Earth says "Yes enough."
Some famous protests joined me, including the Danish and photograph of Helena Christiansen, who said that the Peru journeys, the birth country of her mother, were aware of the anxious matters with which the country must lead because of the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great manifestation, to disseminate the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not a easy task, but it must be done, there is no way to hear it for more time.
The police refused protesters to reach the Bella Center too much, and said that they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because of the use of mass or by bringing cups.
In accordance with the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during manifestations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate discussions, some actors with sports mask and black workers put several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministers.
They were through the buildings, said, adding that they started as callers, but they were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
In the centre of conventions, people gathered around the television screens to look at the walk overnight.
But the protest did not think to spend on the conscience of key officials like Su Wei, a chief negotiator on the climate.
When he was asked if I thought that the manifestation had a constructive impact on international discussions, he replied in English: "He was not really so much of the situation."
Then he continued to say in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can't hear what happens out."
He pointed out that he depended on the perspective of each individual to determine whether the move was harmful or benefitous.
He said that this shows the attention of the public in general and of various sectors to the climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also be said that they affect negotiations, or freedom of others.
Data of a test reveals persistent racial differences
The Federal Qualification Book last week on mathematical performance, was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital Division.
Although the district is still far away from the country's better performance systems, the qualifications free showed that four and eighth level students have been angry to a faster ritm over the past two years, with regard to the towns of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is recorded in the recent numbers of the National Educational Assessment is the persistent difference between African and white students, both at local and national level.
In the past two years, the average rates of four-level students of D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African couples increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the income difference increased between 2007 and 2009, 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans of the eighth level remained essentially fixed, declining a statistically unsigned point, from 245 to 244.
The average white points were not included in the test results, since the sample size was not sufficiently large.
During a six-year extension, the table is no longer alternative.
The difference between white and black students of four-level in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the district, was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
While the points achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some educational lawyers in the district expressed concern last week, since the progress of Dr. Michelle A. El Rhee and the Adrian Fenty Alcalded M. Fenty (Democrata) were largely stimulated by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by assisting those in the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, showed by Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that offers educational equity in the District.
I am not grateful for a difference of two or three points, said the Council's member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.- For accumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth level of the Eaton Eaton.
Brown, a critical Rhee Administration style, said that the message of the test points is that the secondary schools of the city have an unexpected need for care.
Clearly, they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But worried is that we are not dedicating nor the time or energy necessary for our media schools.
Rhee said that the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of students of low performance.
This autonomy, for example, is trained to some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which is directed to students from the higher levels of primary and media school, who did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are significantly behind their pairs.
The mathematics of all day, a curryculum of mathematics from childergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes real life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under the former supervisor Clifford Janey, who believed that it was something of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I think we should continue working to offer the best interventions to students who are under the level of level, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlight whether Rhee can continue to increase the general performance of the system and even provide additional money and resources for schools of low performance, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
There is a kind of shocked dilema for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied urban test points.
The solution of conventional policy is to provide its administrative resources and reforms to localized schools in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts against that important chronograph.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other urban supervisors, it is trying to focus on the white and black class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barrier schools, so that all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can access to excellent public education.
Janey, now overseer of the Newark schools, said in an interview this week that a key element to end with the performance difference is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to competite with autonome schools.
There must be almost 200 days to have the strength of the change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the trade of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which is considered a "indicator" to seek an increase in the next convention.
Doing from higher education a part of more futures
Tourist bus came to the University of Gettusburg with a strong record.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and parpaded for a moment before the white columns, the ladrillo facades and the smeralde beaches.
Graciela’s parents had only been graduated in a secondary El Salvador school.
He did little, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and living in Riverdale, never had a feet placed in a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth-grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the matrix costs $38,690 per year, its attitude was less the number of impressed guests than the potential enthusiasms.
Yes! Here is where I'm going to be! He explained Graciela, whom he would like to study medical study, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of sciences.
Cary, really?, thoughtly, when the guide talked about the low proportion of school teachers.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their trip of three days, and they had already completely absorbted their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to the university.
The question is what.
Although there is a growing concern for the large number of Spanish immigrants who leave the secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that access to the university education they need to access the average class.
In fact, one of these five Spanish "second generation" is graduated in the university, a notable achievement since many of its immigrant parents, especially the Mexican and Central America, entered in the United States without finishing the secondary school.
Their success stories are important and declare researchers because they indicate the way to follow a generation that will play a role in the work force of the country.
Those who analyze the greater performance say that they often have a natural proportion for school and an innate trend to have success.
Many parents also have high goals for their children and find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with the United States schools.
However, tutorial programmes can also play an exceptional role to help Graciela and millions of children as it reaches university, especially if efforts are supported at the time.
Observing the children of low income, whose parents have no experience and ability to help them navigate through the system, it is deducted that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davids, who has studied Latin students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from the child garden to the secondary school.
The federal program that financed the turn by Graciela universities is a useful example.
known as GEAR UP, more than $300 million per year provides to local school systems, to implement university preparation programmes, which start when low income students are in the secondary school and continue to end the secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent of the university, according to the United States Education Department.
Iraqi Petroleo Minister agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns for violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has achieved attractive important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure, during two substances that ended the Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Irak Petroleo Minister with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a main role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated for decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companys have been able to swallow in two of the 10 understood slaughter.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second sub-state, which started Thursday.
The only one that presented a offer lost.
Two US companies reached agreements for swallowing in June.
The poor representation of the US gigantic oil in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry was surprised to analysts.
Irak finally opened his doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans to the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Petroleo Forum of Iraq, a online news center.
It'll pass for a long time before something else is offered in Iraq.
The security concerns, focused on massive coordinated bombs on March, and the political instability while the United States militarys were removed, probably prevented American oil companies to get more energyly in Iraq, which has the third important world's crude reserve, declared analysts.
The United States undertakings were in some cases degrading, because rivals, especially Chinese and other government energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc were the only United States companies that reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main signs of the United States, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have closed shoots with the Iraqi Petroleo Minister and provided technical advice in recent years, have been resolved with the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Petroleo Corporation, the property of the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main wages.
We know that China is in the way to become a major economic and technological power, expressed the portfolio of the Petroleo Minister Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on the part of its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit proposals made offers that were then compared to the barrill grant that the Ministry was willing to pay for increased production above the current levels at each age.
The principal Qaeda planner is apparently murdered in Pakistan
A certain attack on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operation planner this week, said the United States anti-terrorism officials on Wednesday.
To be confirmed, this would be the second mortal attack against a high-range terrorist leader.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who thought he had failed March when a couple of missiles affected their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern Waziristan Province, according to the sources of the United States and Pakistani officials of the region.
The local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were conducting a white car, in direction to the Afghan border, when the car had the impact, said an official of the Pakistanian Civil Intelligence Agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local warriors were shocked to the place and quickly confiscated the remaining of the "fully destrued things".
Local authorities were unable to check the identities of victims, but two American anti-terrorism officials quoted unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-range military planner of the Qaeda, which directed the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghan-Pakistan region.
He was devoted to conspirate throughout the world, said a high official, who spoke from the anonymed, quoting the delicate nature of the United States air attacks within the Pakistani territory.
In view of its central role, this probably included conspirative attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide of the superior command of Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somalia had soon been on the Qaeda lines and was well connected to other extremist groups of the region.
It may not be a name known for some Americans, but this does not decrease any way the threat that planned us and our partners, stated the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Talibhan leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military faction in the tribal area, and three other high-rang agents.
The rythm of non-pilot aircraft attacks directed by the CIA has decreased from the summer, a average of about six operations per month to two, according to a report of The Long War Journal, a website directed by an ungoverned organization.
The reduction may be a improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to restrict their vulnerability while caused suspected informants, stated the site.
The maximum United Nations sent to Kabul to reject
The maximum United Nations sent in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would leave his post in March, ending with a smooth mandate that was damaged by extensive corruption accused in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
It happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoyed that it supports the increase, but it is worried that the United States chronograph for the military retreat that began in 18 months encourages other NATO governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can trust in the international community, Eyede signaled in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also stressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials who cooperate with the Afghanistan ' s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said he was not dimitting, but just fulfilling a promise that made him his family in March 2008, just two years in Kabul.
He said I wanted to notify the Secretary
United Nations General Ban Ki-moon, so there was time to find a replacement.
What I said is it's better you start looking for a successor, showed Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum of two months between my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to United Nations officials.
The officials say that Staffan di Mistura, a Sweden-Italic citizen who recently directed the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to favour President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote of the country and to cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
He refused the crimes, but he said that the accused of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "securly damaged the mission, because he had already had a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
He said that I proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the United States conducted in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the United Nations leadership to enable his successor to contract more personnel in the United States and other Western countries, which are delivered to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence in the right use of their money.
He expressed its frustration for the limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the enormous United Nations contracting regulations had reduced its ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recall only one person since May.
That's catastrophic and it can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will immediately place significant additional sanctions against Iran, because of their failure to put conversations on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, directed to a group of about 300 US troops in the north of Iraq, during a week of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, as a result, in response to the question of a soldier about the probability of this event.
One of the things I'm worse is that, if we have learned something from Iraq for the last six years, it's the inherent inevitableness of the war.
Obama administration is considered a package of sanctions directed to Iran ' s military and political eleite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I found that it would be necessary for "a package of incentives and desincentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "super people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Thursday, in a declaration of the White House's port, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "creative" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, he pointed out that he would return to negotiation on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in change of fuel that is necessary for a medical research reactor.
The administration has stressed this agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, since then, Iran seems to have gone out of the attempting agreements, in part, claim the experts, because Iran's command is divided in relation to the possibility to compromise with the United States.
Frenchly, I think that the long-term of Iran with the international community on some proposals that have actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant sanctions against Iran, showed Gates.
President Obama has set as a limited date on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before replanting other options, even to continue with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "fatal sanctions".
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations declared what he called on Thursday "Unfunded and basic cards" by some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that he was willing to continue with the discussions with the United States and other five world powers "to achieve a appropriate solution in a long term".
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Wednesday, was found in the morning with the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Arctic Petrolean Iraq region, to meet troops in Kirkuk and cured officials in Irbil.
The tensions continue to be high between the curves and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid any delay in the United States projects to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to enhance the curriculum concern on delaying reduction. The US officials quoted the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
Let's go. Left. Roger that.
In a Chinese old age, a rumbo change
Wang Weijia and her husband were grown around by propaganda cards that were sermonyed about the fact that "The Mother Earth is too sweet to support more children" and "un baby but means a more tumba."
They learned the lesson so well that when the government officials of Shangai, alarmed by the low birth index and the old population of his city, suddenly changed this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than a child, their reaction was instant and strong: In no way.
We have already given all our time and energy for a child.
We have nothing for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resources administer with a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notorially rehonored children, the single-born children, affected by "picture emperors" in the country, has occurred in a demographic crisis.
The average birth index has falln in shock of 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six-year-old policy, according to the Division
UN demographic, while the number of residents of 60 years is expected to operate more than 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent to 2050, which is much above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The deficiency is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shangai.
Last year, people of 60 years and more than 22 percent of the residents registered in Shangai, while the birth rate was less than a coupled child.
Xie Lingli, director of the Committee on Family Planning and Municipal Population of Shangai, has demonstrated that fetile couples should have children to “assure the proportion of older people and maintain a future lack of work”.
Shangai is at the point of being “an old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden” stated.
A gradual alliance
In 1978, the policy of one single son of China may be the most political mandate introduced by the Communist Party until the date.
The couples who violate the policy face wide currencies, three times their annual wage in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have evaluated the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have declared abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to be subjected to abortion.
Furthermore, many couples have made abortion according to the gender of feto, leading to a high innatural proportion of men and women.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually entered their posture on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rules, including urban residents, ethnic minorities members, and cases where both husband and women are single children, and in 2007, many of their long-term line weights were attended.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Peking University Demographic Investigation Institute, said that the officials of the Central Government have recently discussed more radical changes, how to allow couples to have two children if one of the couples is a single child.
In July, Shangai became the first Chinese city to start a aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly in the morning, the cards that ordered the family to have a single child were replaced by copy of rules that detailed who would be appropriate to have a second child and how to request a permission.
The city's government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and switch pools below the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial orientation to those who have chosen to have more than a child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very slow.
Deceptive Response
Although rural officers in the Shangai Africans supported a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huanan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
Shangai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 only exceededed around 165,000, less than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipal planning committee in Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want more children.
They want to give him the best to your first son, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally enabled to do so.
But as many Chineses, they only have the inadequate medical and life insurance that the government provides for them.
Without a social protection network, they argue that this option would be irresponsible.
The people in the West are incorrectly the single child's policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a engineer of the construction whose wife is pregnant of seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yes, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples point out psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a single son because she was also it: "We were the center of our families and we were customated to everyone care for us.
We are not habituated to care for others, and we really don't want to care for others. "
Chen Siian, 42 years old, explained it more condensingly.
For parents with two carriages, a second-class-class, which reduce the birth index, it stated that it is sufficiently successful to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years have grown by seeing the struggle of their parents during the first days of China's experience with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves.
Even a single child requires a lot of time for parents, I am.
A mother has to dismiss at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space issues, "that you have to restore your apartment," and the strategic "that you have to have a post prepared for the best guards when the child has 9 months."
Most of your friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours are the first generation with the highest level of life, manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group sets a plan to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, characterized until now by deceasing posts and mutual recruitments, took a renewed attention to the spring of a document that provides ambitious reductions in winter gases during the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that lead to their shadows the majority of the load in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate winter gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that is unexpectedly, with more than 100 world leaders that will arrive to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the poor countries would give to the poor to address the global and long-term calentation.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economy and the main emergent economies would recover their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature increase that political stresses would be ready to to tolerate.
This gives him a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequy, high-representant in Washington for Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document of six pages, summarised a 180 pages negotiation text to focus on what the United Nations most climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama".
He shows the profiles for a possible agreement, where industrialized nations would collect their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to the 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
In addition, countries would cover emissions between 50 and 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also encouraged discussions on Thursday, promised to provide $3,600 million for the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from inundations and sequencies to deforestation.
In all ways, the same kind of verbal artificial fires was presented last week.
The United States's special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected the claims requesting binding gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from the main emergency economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The Manobra indicated that Obama administration is taking a more harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials had done just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without that the main developing countries progress and take steps, Stern, who also regretted that the text did not have enough to ensure that the recruitments could be checked by external observers.
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei, stated that the highest climate negotiator in the United States had no "common sense" or was "something irresponsible" because he had said before the week that the United States would not help China economically face the global recreation.
With the future economic trayectory of the main powers of the world in play, failure lines have been erupting both within the world in the way of development, and between the industrial world and the emergent economy.
The present battle is both to save individual economys as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States by encouraging their respective obligations, while the poorest nations emphasize that the twenty-first countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most powerful action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate in Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing on whom should cost the expenditure to limit winter gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive to seek to contain the major employees of their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developed, supported by Ulate, who also works as regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that conversations will lead to a political agreement.
The Island Small State Alliance, which has 43 members, has developed a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages previously on Thursday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading to international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the employment of small islands has "meased political pressure on the whole political process" in part because they are now unified and require emergency economies, such as China and India.
The discussions took a new emergency while delegations focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues should be solved before the government heads were able to close a treaty.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, descended from the flights and flyed to the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, to enable complaints that will be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (which 13,000 people are coming and out of the convention centre, the actors touching the guitarra present night spectacles by burning out countries that are sold, and hand proposals are being made on hand instead of mail), is a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and Wednesday 60 government chiefs will be in Copenhagen.
We are in the main lines, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the Global Conservation Policy.
Weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km from Greece refines this moon feeling
At 5:13 of Monday morning, a silver will swim the darkness to indicate a train output that marks a revolution for travels in Great Britain.
The first high-speed train of the country will reach 225 km/h, when it passes as a rail from Ashford, Kent, at the St. Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join the Dame Kelly Holmes, on the board of the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He expects that the new service finally connects to Britain to an international fast, reliable train network and connects the major Midlands, the North and Scotia concursions to London.
The disabled areas would become suburbs, business journeys would be cut, and the change of aircraft and cars would reduce the national carbon emissions, as well as the congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the decades of thousands of libraries that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle of planning and environmental fears, can still cut the high speed lines of Great Britain.
High Speed 2 (HS2), a company created in January to provide a study of viability to the Government, will provide his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide a detailed entry of the next stage planned for the high speed network.
The new line that a London to the Midlands of West will be carried out within a radio of five metres in the urban and areas where the environmental impact can be polemic.
In rural areas, the plan will be reached within a radio of 25 meters of a final road.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a higher high speed network than leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The proposed option is a Y configuration, in which only one high speed line reached the Midlands west.
The line would be divided near Birmingham, with a raw that leads to the west from the Peninses to Manchester and Scotia, and the other to the northwest to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
One line would enter Scozia.
"I think this will be the most useful option," said one of the carriage member.
Once finished, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first traject, which would not be inaugured before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the little more than one hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 km/h, converting to the British network in the fastest Europe.
The initial route is designed to support trains of 400 mt length, ability to transport 1.100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a London-Birmingham line.
This means that it would need a London terminal to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of capital space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to the high speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only the St Pancras International station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should continue, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures means that it will not be taken a final decision until a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network should be built in sections.
The trains would initially be obliged to leave the fast lines by the existing carriages north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Scotia over three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point to ensure a change in train aircraft, a reference point for rail revolution.
Contributors are faced with the hypothesis by a £75,000 £ Naranjal of a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the speaker of the Conservant Party, accompanied him to the Contributor thousands of libraries a year for the cost of a naranjal built in the house of his election district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron, because he wanted to live "of ration", increased his hypothesis in £75,000 to build an enrolled extension in his second house in Rutland.
They enabled him to load the additional interest of the shareholder, with hundreds of libraries per month.
The authorities of the Chamber of the Commons have adopted the requests at their time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the expenditure of members. Mr. Duncan said that the applications " could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr Duncan, one of the most rich members of the Parliament, has a house of two floors in a people in its election district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million libraries.
The low plant includes a kitchen, a room to be and eat, but the honorary office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent study of the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of the Commons on its previous hypothetical agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after investigating its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271.406 library from London to the house of its election district, which had been purchased in 1991, the previous year to become deputy.
The documented this week shows that Mr. Duncan requested about 1,400 monthly libraries for hypotecary interests, until March of last year.
In April, your requests increased more than £1,800 per month.
The type of interest of the Scozian Real Bank, Mr. Duncan, did not change at that time, suggesting that the total increase would finance the loan of 75,000 libraries.
The standard BRE standard hypertechnical type was 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, which is now present.
The most recent document issued by the Chamber of Communities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request $1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as President of the opposition of the House in September, after an enclosed reporter filmed it by saying that the deputy had to survive "of rations" after the expenditure scandale.
"Thankly this is nationalized, you have to live from rations and to be treated as m*rda."
He said: "I like my money in my garden, and I request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask much more, but I don't do it. "
The deputy, a Millennium for its former oil trade, was first questioned about its expenditure in May, when he had requested thousands of libraries for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that "that could be considered too much."
A activista caught an axle with the form of the symbol of the esterlin book in the ceped by Mr Duncan as a protest, after being discovered that he requested 4,000 libraries for three years.
Tonight, when they asked him about the increase in the hypothesis, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, both approved by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not the issue of electing and degrading or frozen rules or whatever it is.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to rules, authorized and all.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler way."
Come to those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton Beach palace
Brighton's palaces have found a new impulse for winter months in a calendar of the interactive advention.
In addition, a alternative religious group that encourages the spiritual exploitation through creativeness, invited 24 guards to decorate their palaces for each December, using villacs as its subject.
The event started on 1 December, with invitations that were able to see the last palace from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled sheep and free servicing.
The villas elected until now include Vi Tres Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palace presents the work of Janette Toser, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old Hove TV marketing assistant, is a non-employed clergy of Chichester's Diocese and Beyond's leader.
He stated: "We want the religion to be more relevant for people, in a society of post-Christianism."
"Why do we expect as a church that people come to a old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in a comfortable way.
"The idea of the calendar of the palapa's advenience began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incrediblely creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent this through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Decades of thousands of protesters protested this Sabbath in a ambitious and binding agreement to combat global calentation, worldwide and Copenhagen, where the police stopped several hundreds of people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizations, have dismissed the Dutch capital in a complaint that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach more later Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization throughout the world, represented by these manifestations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents were short after the beginning of the manifestation in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothes, broken shooting with shootings and martyls, reported an AFP journalist.

Most demonstrators arrived in bus and train in the major European cities, but many Asians, among them, were also presented as some Africans.
About 3.000 people, most with celestial clouds responded to the first concentration of the morning in Copenhagen to the convocatory of the Earth's friends to form "Blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil explained the Philippine warrior of the South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: There's a time, he stated the blessed sing angel Kidjo.
In Africa there are rivers that are seated, water courses that can be walked as ever.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the antiglobalization movement approached the ecologist organizations.
The French deputy José Bové, a figure of the antiglobalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “unit climate justice and social justice”: “How the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world”.
The Pacific Asian region, who gathered many very vulnerable islands to the calentization, gave the initial pointage to the manifestations.
According to the organizations, some 500,000 people went to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than one hundred people, in most students, have shocked red clothes and lighted pupils with lights for sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters claimed to act strongly against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network met hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The separator Abjasia elected the President, although Georgia declared "fraude"
This Saturday Abjasia, a separate prorrate region of Georgia acknowledged by Moscow more than one year ago, elected President; however, Tbilisi declares "fraude".
Some 131.000 were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ocean, another Georgian separator region acknowledged by Russia.

In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation of Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993 ended with several thousands of dead, Abjasia tries to demonstrate through this election that is listed to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed have voted to Bagapch.
It was among the electors who were directed to the election table in a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palmers in the entrance.
The topic of Russian domination is the central topic of the presidential election in this region with solar landscapes at the sea of the Black Sea.

The allocation of history and geographic is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The National Education Minister, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview that will be transmitted to the Sunday's Information (JDD, according to his French sigle), that history and geography would be "fortuned" of the reform of the secondary secondary education, although it was removed from the obligatory education in the second year of scientific bachelor.
Moreover, all students of the first bachelor will have four weekly hours and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel states.
For the Minister, "before with the hypocrisy," he says, "the C Rate is no longer a scientific ratio", but "in general, calls to the best students".
The branches of General and Literarian Teaching cannot be undertaken from C, continued to emphasize even: "I've heard that the historians or intellectors were confused because they had removed history and geography in second technological schools."
A IFOP survey published on Saturday in the Humanity revealed that about seven French (69%) were deprobing the government project to remove the obligatory education of history and geographic in second of intellectual and teachings, the left and some right-to-left representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister acknowledged that "no talk" was to remove philosophy of the second-based programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the teaching training, while 16 organizations (study and syndicates) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, offers the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Moreter 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year will make an admission test that will be aimed at its discipline, and at the end of the year, a submission test on its capacity to teach, explained the Minister.
Moreover, they will make practices in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year before school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competitor, you will already have a great experience with the school, i.e. more than 300 hours, you accompanied.
Finally, the Minister notes that it will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In the High School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the climate evolution
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, which has accepted the Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Normal School of Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Prize of Peace, inaugured the "Ernesst", a day composed of a series of presentations of 15 minutes experts, filmed and opened to the public, informed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that brings people to and send them to know more, explained in the context of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo Conference, one of the organizations of this day called the students baptized to the fish of the school stake.
We selected some twenty participants between the experts of their discipline and selected them by their carism, it was necessary.
About the global calentation, "We can speak hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who was exposed without note, but with the help of graphs against some 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, underlined by expecting that the public understands that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on a very serious scientific exhibition."
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is prescribed for February, followed by others to a bimestral ritme.
Delay in payments: disappointment between prison guards, measures are expected to be taken
The prison guards called on Friday to a "general mobilization" to require payment before the end of the year, the prizes and the extra hours, which was put to the budgetary reasons.
The Working Force (2th guard trade) requested the staff to join the demonstration on Monday morning before prisons and "block them" to declare the rob of their own.
The CGT Pensionary (Third of the Professional Syndicate) calls them to "join General Meeting in different prisons to achieve massive mobilization" because it is the incompliance of the payment in December of the "extra-time, night-princes, Sundays and Festival Days" worked in October.
And the first guard trade, the Federal Autonome Penitenciarian Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convoke general mobilization (...) in order to increase decontent and furia".
The Pension Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours have increased in 2009 and not all have been accounted, but they ensure that the salt will be subscribed in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chairman informed that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions to ensure that the payment would be done next month.
No doubt of the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Ministry of Justice in this letter.
Requests to the Pension Administration Directorate to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours is not to be produced in the future.
The payment of December will then be low, except for the staff of the address that enjoys the benefit of the famous primates by functions and objectives, and that "speaks the fault of the budget requirements", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandale, said the interregional FO FO of Marsella, announcing its decision to boicote up to a new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not be working on Sundays and Festivals if the Month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with the additional hours, and also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effectively, it is more regrettable to attack the staff payment, estimates the Burdeo Pension CGT.
According to the trade unions, it is not the same in all regions, since some have more luck than others.

Bousquet moved to the Duje Draganja Croatia (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but did not cut the world mark (20.30), as it had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world's record was on my scale, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, nearly all the swimming swimming swimming polar snakes that will be banned from 1 January.
These bathrooms, originating 238 global records since February 2008, end their epoch in Istanbul, where they first composed in 1999 for the same test.

I didn't get back to this road.
I knew that this time I couldn't be able to batch a world record, but I was able to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsv will be a hard rival in the future, explained Biedermann.

Chad Hummel, lawyer of the "El Pianista" lawyer, announced three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second Division of California, in 1977.
Hummel declared: "I claim that at the same time the charges are dismissed, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "is scalofriant".
According to him, judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have spoken to a fiscal who would have commented that Roman Polanski had to go to prison before he was sentenced, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from his own mouth of the fiscal, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "he lied" to the author of the documentary.

The District Vice-President of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, declared that Roman Polanski "deserves to be here to be present in the hearing."
For this reason, should we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused persons, that there is the possibility of flee?, Asyama asked.
For her, the cinema "speaks a favor to the court, although he disappoints his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to declare his sentence, also stressed "what there were other alternatives to the decision to run".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the cause against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called, again, to close the case.
It claims that your customer does not support it anymore when he resurrected the Polanski case, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Twenty and two years, it's enough."

The Head of Ortopedia and Traumatology of Pitié-Salpereere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel the Monday to Los Angeles to stay next to the songant.
The producer accused Dr. Stephane Delajoux, the neurochirurgic who worked at the song on 26 November last in the international private clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
It's not possible. I need to tell you that.
Los Angeles surgery said they were angry, said Camus.

Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.

The UDF association highlights the tone and warns the New Centre on the use of its sigla
The UDF Association (University for France Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Wednesday before the President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Publica Official of Acquisition) on the seat of the former Russian party, inviting him to remove it from all support, unfortunately be asked.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to restore the UDF sigle, since he believed that François Bayrou was not able to defend his political heritage after having brought his hand to the left.
Furthermore, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UNMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday to the CN National Council.
As supported by its management, he received the support of Mrs Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC), who revended the UDF mark's property, since it was the first to register it in the National Industrial Propriété Institute in 2004.
But on Wednesday night, the UDF Association Office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou, who did not want to see it privately, breaked the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy intimidating them to abandon the seat and to transfer them to the mark's own rights, with a punishment of judicial request.
In these last days, you have made many statements in order to propose your political movement to recover the UDF sigle, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnes del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Aliance.
They also believe that they continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +New Central+, and the slogan +'l'UDF of today in their military material and on the submission page of your site, support the letter signers.
As you already know, you have no right to use the segle, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "instantly address the name of the UDF of any support, as well as the (su) website".
Also requests Hervé de Charette "that transfers the property of (la) to the lawyers".
Instead of doing so, justice will be appealed to respect the laws and rights of UDF members, warnings.
In the letter, the UDF needs to "that is a real political movement since 1978" and remembers that Morin and his friends "elected" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF sequence, according to them.
They also recall that the last UNDF Congress voted in 2007 to Modem for three years and the creation of a office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement found by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, it continued the office, "when she registered the brand," it was no longer "Mord of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
Use skinless and fraudulent the absence of the UDF switch to perform it for your account.
This inscrimination is transformed in a crime, they claim, before CN strategy is burned: "We believe that in policy, as in life, it is more honourable to make its own name that is trying to get out of the anonymous by taking fraudulently a name to which it is not right".

This Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to submit judgment to the artist François-Marie Barnier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionary Liliane Bettencourt, was used by the state of weakness of the octogenary to exposure it from a part of his happiness.
The 62-year-old photograph, known by its star photos of the spectacle, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime with a sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years of prison and EUR 375,000.
This means that in this case there will be a honourable process of a saga on one of the most rich families of France, in which mother and daughter are disputed on the ends of the cosmetic imperium L'Oreal.
However, the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, was subjected to a medical examination of three medical professionals.
The main part of the Oreal shareholder has always refused to submit these reviews, even more than the conditions proposed by Nanterre's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Wednesday should provide a report before 10 March 2010, in which they should consider whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered weakness states and during which periods.
I think he will accept.
I'm going to talk to her, she declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, when he left the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was congratulated by the Court's decision.
It's a great news (...) The loss will show that he (Banier) managed this lady, whom we should protect, has stated.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt started criminal actions against François-Marie Barnier, photographer and multifacetic artist, accusing him of being used for years of low-call of his mother to get a million euros in donations, by cheques, life insurance contracts or art works.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be handled by the photograph, who considered a long-term friend.
On Thursday, while the court considered the outcome of the action taken by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers made a great family condemnation in some cases.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his customer would send (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which he said that he dislooked the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "I could explain my daughter that I wrote to Barnier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since your wedding, I could never again talk to Françoise."
By its part, Nanterre's Fiscality, again, considered that the applicant was not in conditions to compare, so much more as a judge of protection had refused in these past days to make a request to open an judicial prosecution procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full ability to compare justice, is not under the protection and has no tutor.
Nobody else can compare in his place," stated the representative of the Public Minister, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that a sentence would be made on Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' admissibility.
Revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been worthy...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large enterprises regarding their assets reminds the position of companies regarding consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that partners are bound to "values" which have been determined from above as previously tried to imposing consumers from manufacturing technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution made it place to market conquising strategies, although the authorisation attempt to put products that are not related to customer preference factors are regularly repeated.
Demobilization of employees may end in mortal immoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of iceberg of a very general phenomenon that is particularly affected by executives.
This demobilization undertakes seriously the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of the I+D and, moreover, of business intellectuality.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "exiges that all parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment that is fully opposed to the recommendations of an authorised address.
For this reason, we call for a government revolution, which would be to put collaborators in the centre of the business concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have relative use
Do internal views such as the questionnaire made by Orange among its ashalaires will encourage the government revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- In principle, because I could verify that, faced a new situation, and after many turns, all enterprises have done essentially... what they have always done! B989
- Secondly, because authorism, one of the pathologys of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most guidelines have a simple vision of human behavior.
As they come from the large engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
Adoptan, by intellectual curiosity, the ancient conductive theory that the "neurociences" Americans recently reactivated, and that the Studies Institutes and Mediums widely spread to their shoes.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent research of IPSs published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directs in a mechanical management post inadequate to the world of today.
identification and measurement of mobilization factors
On the contrary, the revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern enterprises is to adopt a final vision of human behavior.
You can integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for salaryers, the commitment to the company is only possible if this appears clearly as a means to make a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis are taking this concept of the motivations of employees.
Studies showed that they judge their undertakings based on a default twelve that allows them, through the images that have the company, to evaluate what this offers to achieve their own live projects.
Thanks to the identification and measuring of mobilization factors, business leaders can control, prevent, and anticipate their "social depth" and reverse human rights management "to the place".
In this way, they create a favourable field for organized development of a strong and efficient intellectuality of business.
The discours of Oslo: by the "just war" Obama receives the joy of the right
This Thursday, the North American right, satisfied that the Nobel Prize of Peace 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, called on the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The conservators, who had dismissed the delivery of the premium to Obama on 9 October, had this time welcomed the presidency talk, as well as Sarah Palin, former candidate to the vice-President during the 2008 elections.
She sweet what she said, said Ms. Palin, the main figure of the right side of the Republic of the Republic of the United States at the U.S. Journal Today, and acknowledged that she himself had addressed the topic of the war "also necessary" in its recently published memorys.
In my view, the war is since then the last thing the North Americans want to be obliged to do, but it is necessary.
There's gotta stop terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who ruled the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was given, this juvenile in Oslo, to justify the response to the force, a way to explain its decision to send more than 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opposite in Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the President had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really good, and the former Chamber of the Representatives' Chamber was pleased, which, in particular, applies to the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the conversation appeared very historicly, Gingrich declared, during an interview in the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former election representative, who some considered a potential candidate to the Republican investment for the presidential elections of 2012, was congratulated when he recalled the members of the Nobel Committee "what they would not be free or could give a prize of peace if the resource to the force was not available".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speech and current chronist at Washington Post, Obama proclaimed "a very North American speech".
Besides being presented as "the citizens of the world", as "speak it," "he spoke as a North American President" by remembering Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not much to save it," says Gerson.
Among the few of the right not very convinced, a harcon of Bush's era, the former embassy in the United Nations, John Bolton, called the discours of "monoton, pretensive and inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
On the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich warned to see Barack Obama justifying the resource to force.
When we cover the war with the concept of justice, it is easy to justify the mask of innocents, warned.
However, the left center press opened the President.
The Angeles Time, although still believed that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, qualified his discours of "superproduction" in particular for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's discours should "serve as a road sheet to guide international decisions in combating conflicts, poverty and oppression," commented the Californian newspaper.
Obama "declared the speech that was needed", suggested the New York Times, judging it "in the midst and constructive time."
Trade transport: three marine negotiations to ensure shipment
After three ammunitional negotiations, the trade and the TLF trade and logistics, the only patrol organization that remained until the end, arrived on Thursday afternoon to an agreement which ends the signing of the shipment and the threat to the shipment.
During the meeting of signs on Thursday night, the transport secretariat, Dominic Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiations that began Thursday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators were dismissed at the sun of the Wednesday with the hope of signing quickly the text of agreement at last morning.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Onestra, OTRE) were removed from a port.
But a six-hour meeting was required to make sure that everyone agreed and was signed at 18.00 p.m.
The conflict "he had been very harmful for the companies" and "that was feared that the end of the year celebrations would be struck", said Bussereau.
The text prescribes an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport) and of 2.9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The price per hour is from 8,72 EUR to 9.06 for low salary.
It's not much, but we're starting with a lot of depreciation, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
In that way, we will order our militarys that there are no cuts or blocks in the supply centres.
But it can always have some rebellious disconform, she added.
Philippe Grillot, Chairman of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good agreement", although it was "facile to grant increases to high salaries, taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the monthly order of EUR 170 for low payments and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common understanding agreement that respects the workers, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) acknowledged him as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "a acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides an increase in the 3 per cent movement expenditure and the celebration of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of a extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective convention.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of $100 million in the patronal charges" was subject to an amendment by the Government in the draft rectification financing law for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Tuesday night.
The Government will request the Senate to vote under the same terms.
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, first of all, to enterprises associated with this organization and, secondly, all the professionals, where the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be "with the biggest shortness", Bussereau assured.
The opposition of patronal organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "ingeous negotiation", since the 100 million euros "he had been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of Transport has forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion of a analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat flour on the next Wednesday dinner, was regretted by the Onestra.
For the OTRE agreement, "the stability of many SMEs in the sector for the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, disconformed syndicates with the RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of ships between trade unions and the direction of the RATP, there was no agreement and the trade unions remained insatisfair in respect of their first request.
For this important weekend of shipping purchases, the Saturday and Sunday will only driving trains between 10:00 and 20:00, as a result of a train of each two in the central trail ( between Defence and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galerias, who expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is working to provide services to large shops".
The RER Cross from West to East the Paris City.
The RATP tramo comes from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-Sint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallé.
This Friday, about one of the two trains rounded in hours, and almost no trains in hour valle, as was expected.
Thursday, there was no disorder in the easts thanks to the organization of the peoples of the French island.
Thus, at the alba, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normally, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that it had been "a more premature and medium hour to reach time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, indicated the SNCF, which had planned to supervise the order police and forces.
RER A, which operates the SNCF from Cergi-Le-Haut or with the destination to it, came or leaves from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of workers in the garden will be held on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "not satisfactory" according to the trade unions, of a meeting that was held with the direction on Wednesday afternoon.
The Director of the EEA proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of REL A: time of work, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want the drivers who claim a first to be, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also commented on its first proposals, noting that the direction "is not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting of the Monday was expected to "a broader analysis on the terms of exercise of professionals" stated the RATP.
What also led to the syndicates to say that the company "not imported users of the weekend."
During the morning, some 150 drivers entered a committee in Paris.
Then the address, which was rejected until then dialoging during the chair, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday after the Unity and Independents had presented a predict.
Syndicates ask for a first of 120 euros (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and are required to degrade the working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all on the second level of their professional carriage, cover up from 2.200 to 2.700 euros and from 600 to 650 euros of priests, with alternating, Sundays and holiday days.
Turkey's justice deplores the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court failed on Wednesday for the resolution of the main procured party of the country, a decision which immediately caused angry manifestations in the Curde Community, South-East of the country and Stambul.
This decision could be very complicated by the task of the Government, which has just had a hand to the curde community by trying to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had been converted into the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", stated the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was an unilateral, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dilution, Kiliç said, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including his President Ahmet Turk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, are paragraphs of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the goods of the party by the Deputy.
The TPT has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being partialist parliamentary.
The decision is due to a procedure laid down by the Supreme Court, Abdulrahman Yaliginkaya, in 2007, infringing the DTP to obey the "principes" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which was considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal shuttle of PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organistic links" with the PKK, but is refused to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court ' s verse is at the time that the Government has a hand to the currency community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that kurdes stop supporting the KKK and thus put the end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders said that a dilution could generate a recruitment of tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where a large number of manifestations against the terms of detention of the head of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated in combats with the police during the last few weeks.
Since the advertisement of justice, thousands of protesters were gathered against the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great qualification of the South-East in most of their curves.
The Order Forces of the Order slaughtered lacrimogens and used water canons, while the manifestants launched Molotov bombs or stones with dogs.
In Istanbul, there were also hundreds of people.
After the verdict, Turkey stated that the decision of justice would "develop distress".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (courda, NDLR) by solving a party, stated the press.
The Government, formed by a party from Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
First of all, we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus it is not resolved, stated the Minister of Energy, Taner Yyiz.
This Boicote decision completes the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analysis Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, wait for a PKK reaction, agreed.
On Thursday, PKK was a attack that died seven soldiers three days ago in the Northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in the last months.
Nieves can start suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In absolutely, it is something with what he wants to do the impossible life of citizens, comments the ESF's maintenance director in winter winter.
But with that, your employees can learn to try and dominate the whole of vehicular technology.
Maybe the weekend of the meteorologists announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to occupiate from snow and ice.
In that case, the ESF acts in accordance with a Minute Plan.
As soon as the nest prously in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall below zero degrees, they get 20 of the calls we take A with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
For example, the main arteries and adventures such as the New path and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the bombers body, public transport routes, peattonal areas and we take with pendients, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The services of the ESF start around three of the morning
They must cover about 1,040 km, according to the necessary, in a maximum of three hours with humed salt, which will be better adhered.
So the FES starts around the three of the lunch: "The ways are free until it starts the traffic of the point hours."
The difficult is when it starts to rain around 7:30 p.m.
"So we have a problem," comments the director of winter road maintenance, "for then no one is ready to get out of space to salt vehicles."
Soon, when you're not wearing, it touchs the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Council-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has the post and secondary streets.
That's where the moles are generated, Brauburger knows.
At five of the morning, the ESF's childhood is started, mainly the dangerous and crudelines are deleted.
In general, the ESF could not be charged of the totality of bicycle carriages.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose the bridges mainly, comments Brauburger.
As soon as these are rebalaids turning rapidly, the salt vehicle is moved as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The coun of the dinosaur
The Tawa halla had the same aspect as many other meat dinosaurs: a animal of two meters of length and 1.50 meters of height that would run over the two strong back shoes, had a wide head with afilled and curves dents, short arms with shoes in hoz form and a long round.
If the species had lived a few million years later, this would not have been something special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these corporate features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the juvenile Science magazine.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then located in a sequence area of the supercontinent Pangea in theecuador.
Tawa opened a new window towards the previous evolution of the dinosaurs, comes Nesbitt.
We show a lot about genealogical relations, propagation and features of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologs started a scavation in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we found a twenty-five of dinosaury bones on a day, this is something without previous for Triasic seats, report Randall Irmis member of the Museo of Natural History of Utah.
The investigators quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered in total.
A discovery confirms the theory of the ancient history of the dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun gods of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is a exceptional lounge: "The triasic dinosaural fosils are extremely rare, generally only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share from all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of the dinosaurs, for example, comments Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current view flow, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fosils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite contraverted.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the sauors were shared in their three most important geneological languages: the carnivor theopodes among those found in the Tyronsaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quarter saadrhopostes known as "long arm" and their relatives, and the Ornithishia herbivorous (souries with bird pelvis) to those who, for example, belong to the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and its colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theopod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa clan, the investigators found air tanks, such as those also have the seeds of the terophodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bottles, bird breathing is more efficient than the mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the vertebral column were apparently filled with a partly air.
Tawa is the thermopod with the older and primitive air shoes, comes Randall Irmis.
Since the intimate line of the later giant sauropods also had light bones and eggs, it was likely that the common fronts of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory halls to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs until now known in South America lived, researchers decree that the sauries had come there for the first time.
Thus, the three geneological languages were separated in a start and extended from South America by all the rewards of the earth, which was still a single earth mass, the supercontinente Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the rest of the other two terpods not very nicely intimate.
The three cannot fall from a single parent precepter, they argued the investigators.
We believe that at least three migratory halls were given to North America, Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, coautor of the Scientific study.
Of course there are opposers.
An older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs brothers, lived in the current Poland, comments the paleontologo of Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorsionate image, because simply in South America are still maintaining many dinosaurs fossils, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the dynamics have been achieved to evolving a relatively rare line of retreats to the dominant earthquakes of the Mexico remains an enigma.
While in the Triasic, the dinosauries still shared their vital space with many other retreats, for example, with the elders of the current cocodrils and the pterosauries and many other sauors.
In the end of the Triasic, the dinosauries expanded around the world and developed many new species, while the parent has extended to the border of the Triasic to the Jurasic.
Successful historys were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, comes by Martin Sander.
I could have been given a massive extinction to which the dinosaurs survived per event, but the other retreats did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could win the contractors in the area.
Successful historys are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a frozen meteorite impact of a group of species, which had also been evolving in the Triasic, and since then had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Participate teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Participate Teachers from Napolis, Quebec, Edimburgo, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin Bremen.
The police disappearing of the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt repercussed around the world.
278 professors and Catholics from the University of Goethe, although also of higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North America, are solidarized with protest students in Westend Campus.
In a statement amended in German and English, the police disappearance promoted by the Governing Council is "rejected".
Warner Müller-Estler, President of the university, has disappointed last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational work, because the walls and works of art were covered by propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered pain.
The material damage, they judge the signers, does not justify "the violent dilution of courses organized by the same students and Catholics by a police command".
The disaster represented an "unacceptable attack" to the freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach in the vandalism served for "delegitimation and criminalization of protest" and divide the content attention.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Doctors require immediate retirement of the judiciary.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, says.
Legisted Protest
The young ones of the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Sindicatos are also solidarized with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future, comments the national youth secretariat of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the action of the rector of university and police.
We are grateful with the university rector.
Destruction and occupation are fully unacceptable means, commented on a current Stunde issue on Thursday in the Province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, and Peter Beuth, delegated by the Provincial Parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the left, is different.
The CDU was used as a pretext to criminalize protest, and Janine Wissler (Link).
Instead of studying the arguments and requirements of students, it is difficult.
Iceland has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city that was unacceptable for Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was strongly guarded in the Soviet Union for the secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216.000 inhabitants, located 37 km from the centre of Moscow, is considered as the "Silicon Valley of Russia".
There are important micro and nanoelectronic research centres.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted Riedberg's Scientific Headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutions and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were held and now, the Sunday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "strict cooperation protocol".
The Moscow Vice-alcalde Juri Rosljak and the Selengrado Chalk, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt stated the Head of Edwin Schwarz Planning Services.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian scientific enterprises want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of Russian important enterprises and research institutions.
For example, the Moscovian Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The community was found in 1958 as the "Socialist Planning Ciudad" for arms research.
Selenogrado (formally translated as "Green Ciudad") received his name from the forest mountain landscape, where research facilities were placed.
Stuttgart flows
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not put for nothing enough.
For the parties of the project, it is simple and slowly "the new heart of Europe".
The law I know. S21 is much more than the reduction of a rail station, more than a monstruous construction project, which will lead to the capital of the Banden-Württemberga a decade of unremediate construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered at that time in engineering flights of the 19th century, acting as a trail of a modern rail traffic, since anciently there was a large amount of time to engage the locomotors backwards.
Rodar, stop the journey, but this must be done.
That's why they should lose the terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step station, which is about half of the traject of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there the slogan of "Corazon of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in the Hexen and Bavara capitals it is almost impossable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversable locomotors with tractoral units and driver cars in both extremes.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE built to Ulm will be already started.
The federal and common politicians have so prepared.
The carriage continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are contributing to them and not to the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified until a certain point.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The step station and the fresh support are thought for the transport of persons, which has contributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
In that time the competition of low cost flights was not given.
However, modern transport policy must first be employed to strengthen the transport of goods, since rail transport is significantly more ecological than road vehicles.
However, the new ones are good for loading trains because of intense gradients.
More seriously, S21 also indirectly affects many other carriage projects.
More than six billion euros should be entered in the Zuaves.
That's the official digit.
Experts consider that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is sure that in the next decade the money will miss in other crosses and stretch passages on the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are located on the list of the Department of Transport.
One of the most important ones is the expansion of over 180 kilometers of long riels through the Rin Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-pass trail is built.
It'd be urgent here to put the accelerator as it's due.
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.
The tram of the Rin Valley will be the bottle for the international goods transport: through the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the sentence on the airport.
The Federal Government remains a duty in the Wiesbaden' autonomy parliament, if he is going to submit a appeal for the failure of the prohibition of night flights of Hesse's administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have managed experts to investigate VGH's legal investigation, more than 400 pages, as stated by the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had been assigned in this date, that in the case of the construction of the Northwest aeroporting track planned in the Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the prohibition of night flights again.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as stated by the Federal Government, would not be conciliable with the binding legal protection of the rude population because of air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is to submit the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this posture and stressed the representatives of the Government to dismiss the appeal for the Administrative Court of the country in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Group, Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel, urged the CD and the FDP to respect its promises for the prohibition of night air traffic, which had done before the elections. Instead, this could be taken as a lack of word.
It's very difficult, if one lets it do his word, said the chief of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's slogan "We fulfill our word."
The Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gumbel's recruitment, which the federal government would try through the duties of the law and trucks still get its night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would need enough time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "prior fast print".
We need a legally intakeable decision, said Stefan Muller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the statements of its group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
The US banks return the aid provided.
The large US banks slaughtered by the crisis are disabled from their state attacks.
The "Bank of America" once returned the aid provided by the Tarp Bank Saving Fund of a total of €45,000 million (approximately EUR 30,000).
Also, the Citi Group plans to return state aid, according to the United States CNBC report.
In this way, institutions intend to be freed from the restrictions that had been taken from the hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation of the payment of bonus to the directors and the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had reached about 19 billion net money through convertible goods.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had a lot of means, among others for the sale of rubbers.
The bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked the US contributions on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had noted badly the efforts to absorpte the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to get money on the capital market to be free of its obligations against the state.
The CNBC informed the source of known circles that the United States bank could already announce its capital increase for $20 billion for this Thursday.
A representative of the Citi Group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their support for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
Finally, everything was faster than it was thought.
Only two weeks after the Administrative Board of ZDF ( German television channel) press the Nikolus Brender head to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Tonight the committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF primary study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the employee, officially to not anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the no longer damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be adopted in the administrative council.
Frey, the candidate of Schchachter, needs 9 of the 14 crowd members.
The result of the vote was not yet specific to the closure of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew the contract of Nikolus Brender for more than five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destination was a amazing failure to Schacher, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council for weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in their position.
The opposition against the head of draft was organized by the President of the Hesse Government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He rejected another mandate of the prestigious edition head with the argument, which under the direction of Brender's HDF information would have lost hearing indices.
Even soon before the elections, there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on ZDF was affected.
At the end, 35 public specialists had been entered into the debate, which called Koch's path as a non-constitutional.
But she didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political, pedagogy and Roman philology.
Then he worked on the Southwestfunk embassy and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 ZDF was changed, in principle, to the "day-day" informative.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990, the personal rapporteur of the editorial head; 1991/92 corresponsal in Washington; until 1998, director and conductor of the matuin programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then, the ZDF study director in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional request after Brender's destitution, which was still elected as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinado, explained last week that the federal states should change the State Convention of the ZDF in such a manner, that the proposals for staff of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retirement of partial politicians from the ZDF control crystals was discarded by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent game: he strongly criticized the grace for the destitution of Brender.
Thanks to this periodic independence test both Schächter could appoint it to the head of the edition without losing the face, as the Administrative Board could vote, without a suspect to give him the post to a party sequence.
In the calculations of the Frey Party, all forms of the left liberalians are assigned.
university carriages are deployed
Partial efficiency for students: After a year of education-related workshops, the Ministers of Education and Cultural of Federal States finally ended. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Education with university recruiters, both were agreed to try to improve the study conditions in literature and more.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their cars.
For example, it was agreed to reduce the load of reviews: Basically, each cart module must end with a single review.
Furthermore, it is intended to consider the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justified measurement".
Political and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities inside and outside Germany.
Federal states are committed to more flexiblely confect the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master's carriages.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this should be no longer existing.
Unexpected reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Education and the universities continue to speak on the improvement of the ability to achieve and complete a car (audibility).
Now the first time it was spoken of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation counsel agreed to decrease the amount of reviews: "All modules end with a single review," said in a document of 30 pages, which aims to regularly adopt university roads.
With the "sensitive reduction of the load of reviews" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, thus explained the director of the Accreditation Board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in a future, the "auditability" must be the decisive criteria for the configuration.
The modules and contents should be completely reviewed as regards unnecessary restrictions of students in the selection of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which could and promote their own initiative".
These rules would be valid for new carriages, but also in the review of existing carriages.
These should be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that would be late until 2015 to review all the carriages.
The responsibilities of this would be at the level of the country of 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Board, which is installed by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states to influence such a manner in the agencys, that the amount of materials and reviews are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already been agreed with the ministers to take such measures.
Only now, Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means for the next development of the Boloni process have been facilitated.
With this money, universities should implement support programmes and study advice, as well as strengthening review offices and outside.
The federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to bring to Parliament a new university law.
It believes that it should be sufficiently a review for the end of a carriage model.
The setting of the carriage should be more flexible, and also wants to ensure recognition of evaluations in other universities and to facilitate accessibility to Master.
To the end of the year, it is intended to review all the carriages about its "audibility".
On Thursday, the Government and opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
Apart from the joy, there was also critical concerns of decisions.
In the federal directive at the level of the Juso university groups (socialist youths) it was required that the setting of education policy should not be carried out by the ministers and university adctors.
After the earnings of education, students should now be able to consider.
The President of the university recruiters collection (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported students: "We need the experience of students", said the Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK released a joint reform document.
For the University of Education and Science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not all sufficient: the synagogue requires legal law for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility of access to a later Master's car.
In addition, federal states must ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are sufficient studies places for Master with the best possible study conditions. In this way, he informed a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
Federated states have to meet enough more teachings.
But about a greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than one note on the foot about Herta Muller
"Introduction and exit from Germany is almost without control," says the first line of a lirik Werner Söllner poem in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a deputy who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked as German and English teacher in Bucarest, and then as a reader in a child book editor, before turning to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner gave him a number of literature prizes, in 1993, he was a director of the Hesse literature in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt University, and since 2002 he was the director of the Hesse literature for the Mousonturm.
God speaks enough on Monday during a meeting in Munich about the German literature in Romania in the shoe and the defigured spectrum of his senders of Security.
Visiblely insecure and forgotten, Söllner reads a statement in which he acknowledged the participation as IM in the Roman secret service Securitate against German-Runse writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Womendorfer.
With some of the presents in 1989, Söllner had received the German Prize of the language.
The rectification attempts were slowly started at the beginning of 1971.
"That is why I am someone who has not been defended enoughly against the attempts to cause the fear of the Security", concluded Söllner.
Lirik Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time the Nobel literature premium to Herta Muller and its literary polyemic, unlikely with the dictatoral domination mechanisms, is the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors orally in Romania, for a case that proves that abismos and maliciousness of a political system, which is based on control and sponjage.
Werner Söllner is, so it is known until now, not only a author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM Walter's poster had played a role, said the literatory scientist Michael Markel after the confesion of Söllner, and highlighted the positive influence of Walter's IM.
He had forgiven or defended it in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to do this statement," said.
The statement of Söllner in this way and against this public was unexpected, the confesion of an ex-president and his work with the Roman secret service, however, is not so surprised.
Germany would have been a comfortable refugee for the Securitate-Spitzel, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the "Time" weekly after reading his own poster of 914 pages.
The involvers will certainly have speculated and will have known in some cases, which names were hidden behind the Sorin, Voicu and Walter's.
Unlike the revisation of the issuers Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the Security Control expeditors is still sufficiently widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boicoteed and difficult in the past few years.
A national security advisory (CNSAS), related to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the employers since then is better.
Since 2005, there is a law which regulates the administration of expeditors.
A interview, after granting the Nobel Literature Prize to Herta Muller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large. In this interview an ex-Head of the Tedesvar Security talked dependably on the concovery.
"He has psychics," finally, they just asked her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions with the Söllner case, as many times when there are calls guilty.
Why right now? Who has been caused to harm him? The calm reaction of the listeners against the confesion of Söllner lets wait for the continuation of this story will be registered more by the experiences of knowledge, not so for the adjudication of guilty and for anger.
For the genes of Herta Muller's work, who received last night the Nobel Prize of literature, it is more than a simple note on his feet.
The Liga of Campeones as a garnition to fill the stomach
When the new trainer of the VfB smoker team of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, composed of a Naranja color platform of its team provider, addressed a Mercedes of the Class C a fourth hour after the average night, was the impression that a member of the external service was elegantly clothing out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, where the manufacturer of sportive articles had distributed samples.
The man of the calves had contracted a chofer because he had not yet known the city.
Otherwise, he could also drive the car itself: at the end of accounts, he had no alcohol in game, and he was not joyful to the 55-year-old man.
It was a pleasant velvet, but tomorrow it would start again.
It would start the first time.
In the words of the suicide, which had been contracted only three days ago: "It's true that we reach the eights of the end," namely, in the Championship League, thanks to the triumphe 3:1 against the Universea Urziceni of Romania, "but we can't let us cease for success: we'll have to fight brutally against the decline."
"The much more important task" was expecting you next Sunday, stated.
Then it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classs" in the cotidianity of the link.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly proved again, after the three degrees of Marica (5), Trish (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sourthee
The final octets of the Campeon League League (16/17 and 23/24 February/February Parts 9/10 and 16/17 of March) shall be issued in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy was remained limited by the pleasant entry of Babylon’s successor.
Not only in the natural salvador, who recently inspired them to the unconcerned professionals of Stuttgart confidence in himself, is available to deliver and enjoy the game.
I was with the players and I told them that they had to focus on their strong points, I encouraged them to be more swimming, explaining the reparator of the souls Gross his reception of the success that so simple sound, but that with the Babbel therapy had no more effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the Babbel's party, Jens Lehmann, "when in the football a new impulse is happening, sometimes things that have not been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks suspended to a lesson, continued to become the most local player thanks to its dynamicism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" resulted from the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work the new chief: "He is a man who interferes back, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this was what I had missed, of course, when I was Babylon.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warn the Horst Heldt Sport Guideline
But VfB Stuttgart needs about any consciousness.
Like Gross, also players and administrators were overlooked the triumph against a weak defence because of the lack of residues and fully refunded from Roman invited people.
They had also winned in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 1:4 had arrived the triste shock, he thought Khedira.
And the director Horst Heldt warned that even though a timetable goal was reached, the other was still very far.
We still haven't overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in his seat for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to be updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the port Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions to take others, and not Jens, held Heldt's hard criticism in Lehmann.
This had reprojected the deficiency in the direction to the guidance council, which had decided to change training by the pressure of adolescent fans.
Also that his free day after the games was removed Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", reputed Heldt, and announced consequences for the viewer.
Probably they will not be friends forever, both quarentons.
But at least they agreed with all others that, without the previous efforts made with the replaced trainer team, the spectrum of great game and battle force had not been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a major participation in the success", they said Heldt and Lehmann to the unity; and he also agreed to the man of the plastic smell.
World struggle of weight-weight campionate
Awful in Berna: Again and again, the editor Kevin Johnsonn was leading to the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and pledges.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was an unity.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a worldwide weight champion.
The 38-year-old camp in the WBC association's version arrived on Saturday night in Berna to the United States Kevin Johnson by one-time decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
To Klitschko was his third successful defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two times a world campaign of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it couldn't be done the sweet that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended 39 triunfos in 41 professional battles, two times he had to be able to be slaughtered because of his lesions.
The publisher Johnson had to accept the first shoot in his battle number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators in the Arena de Berna, Klitschko, with a 2,02 meter station, I wanted to spend the battle over all with his left hand.
But Johnson, one ten centimeters below, which had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was squirting one and another of the shoes of the world campaign, so Klitschko could not decisively bring to its right dangerous goal.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a repository, and just tried to pass through the rounds.
Although it was caused Klitschko with words and shocks, his shoes were only rarely reached to the world camp.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who suffered 12 full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the driver had already produced a certain scandale in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "Horrible Zombie" that "no one knows to do anything."
When he performed the peasant, the champion was left to cause the Wednesday to take Johnson's sunlight "to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko return
Also in his fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a period of almost four years, he arrived in that time to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and he had restored the "su" cinture of the WBC, which had previously had to deliver without fighting.
This year, after his defence in the title of Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola, from the United States.
In this struggle I only received a shock, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko his fast return to the ring.
But his dream remains to meet all the four important titles in your family.
His brother Vladimir is a global camp of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the census belongs to the British David Haye, after it drew in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2,13 meters of staturing.
In the past summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Surely, the company that you promote is planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kenduz case
The front attack of the opposition: the chief of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because of false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the links require an explanation to the channel.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition revoked the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor to Gutenberg (CSU), who had inflicted the causes.
In the issue of news "Tagsview" of the Saturday, transmitted by the ARD TV channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that "the scientists didn't say the truth" on the dead bomb of two chambers.
In one of these cases, normally it is said: He said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Trust for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, and he read Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Wednesday, it was known that in this attack it was not only tried to destroy the secutive trucks but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the United States aircraft, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, the Coronel Klein, in accordance with the NATO investigation report, died or was sentenced until 142 people.
The green, the SPD and the left urged the Federal Canciller Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Federal Parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the Afghan government policy, and if the cancility, the army and the information services have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Künast.
The government's port, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected the criticism.
The cancer did not influence any of the concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, said.
On Saturday, they had also questioned about the presentation of the Ministry on the reasons for the delay of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, they had both been informed to Gutenberg as well as about the transfer of the attack to shops.
It was officially said that they had rejected the existence of the NATO reports and hidde details delicate to the Minister.
However, since the surrounding of the two high-range officials, they had even indicated the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of the Coronel Klein, who was the command, and a report of a field pattern.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntagszeitung".
Until the moment it has not been received the answer, it was said.
The Ministry was not expressed on Saturday on the reproachs that it was done, and it pointed out that this would be raised in the Federal Parliament's research commission, which will be the next Thursday.
Honical Municipalities
In the state of monitoring, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental diseases and drugs are disrupted between imagination and reality.
While it happens during the dream, it's in order.
When we are accommodated in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver us to the most beautiful imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience dreams like states during the guard, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, most of them are considered in the modern Western world as a fool or drug, or at least as a maneuver.
But such images and voices are not only in mental or drug diseases.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, painting tables or write new things, in times they make the limits between dream, laughter and reality disappear.
Honourly modified consciousness states can appear in the most different forms, in the best cases we call them visions, and in the worst, crazy.
Although the detainees and effects can be distinguished, the visions of Hildegard van Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the chamic possession states, and the psychics and alucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums occur when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been discharged – all of the dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonine and acetilcolin – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a squizofrenic psychics, complex alucinations and disappointed thoughts appear very frequently.
Severity has no longer power on him
The relationship between crazy and dream has been occupied with philosophys and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles conceived the alucinations as a form of visional dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatric, found in 1861 a "gran likeness of the state of looseness with the holy states" for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "un psychics, with all disproportionate, and specimens of this."
It's the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Your body is of two sizes and skinly colored.
Severity has no power over him, is flewing around the bedroom.
He feels a shock.
Turn from him, figures of demons with balls, with roses like blood, deforms, recycled the dentists.
They're persecuting it, patheting him with weight and flameful shoes, cut it against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Stress and malicious voices come from the walls and the radio.
It can't be able to support them, the voices that are insulted and disappointed.
Henning T. rounds two sleeves of the stereo, snake them to form a shore cloud, and fix them in a shoe on the shoe.
He goes up in a skin and puts the cloud around the skin.
Shut up.
The shooting is shocked.
What a lesson!, they shouted the voices in a crowd that revises the Timpans, "See the clinic and make you worried!"
Now, Henning T. has 40 years of age and has experienced six acute psychics, the last two years ago, the first 20 years ago.
The cause that I produced was LSD.
Your diagnosis is psychic squizo-affective-paranoid, also maniaco-depressive, take medicines, against depression, mania, squizofrenia.
You've learned to live with your sickness, three years ago she's married.
In the psychics I experienced the worst and deepest desperation, says.
Alucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population is sick at least once in the life of skizofrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute squizophrenic psychics, most of the times affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the internal, and happen in an overwhelming state that can lead to alucinations, delicates of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Specifically extended is the voice of the voices: voices that you give commands, comment or dialogue.
Also, optical alucinations are frequent.
The affected one is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter distressing signals, consciousness appears inundated of pressures.
Like the dream, psychics also opens the compounds to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest shoes of conscience.
The perception of the reality in psychics is focused on the subject, says the Catholic Thomas Fuchs, doctor of the General Psychiatry clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The skizophrenic is located in the center of the events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, a passive role, as in a dream, feels distracted by events and cannot organize them actively.
This is why skizophronics are often feeling threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Generally it is not possible to adapt the reality to them, alucinations are a cruel reality, dispersing, impossible.
Have experienced a lucination once in life
Instead of a dream, Fuchs says, "the space and sensitive structure of the reality that is under the psychics remain in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and alucinations are supported in the reality, the distance of experience has occurred in reality.
For researchers, the reason why our brain makes horses.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states can lead any person to lose contact with the reality in a provisional manner.
But not all people develop a psychic.
It seems that there is a genetic provision for skizofrenia, but studies in gemeles have demonstrated that there are also other determining factors.
The investigators suggest that affected ones suffer minimum brain damage.
We suspect that the neuron matureness of the brain is affected in a early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an inconsistent how this neural system change is produced, which has not been absolutely shown for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonants of a psychics when there is already a pre-related condition.
Similarly, alucinogen drugs can cause psychics because they interfere into the brain transmiser system.
When the brain calms
The logo of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their alucinations and take very precious medicines to be freed from them, while others pay by drugs that allow them to experience some, says the Catholic psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Increasing an allucination as a pleasant or not often depends on the view point.
Casten has collected 10 years ago reports on alucinations and visions and has analyzed the results in the book The irreal world in our head (The irreal world in our head), published last year.
The alucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychics, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them, together with psychological disorders such as the limited personality or depression disorder, often also diseases such as migration, epilepsia, multiple, Alzheimer and croneoencephalical traumatisms.
in a surprising way and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people suffers alucinations.
The alucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally repressed.
It appears when the brain areas in which sensitive perceptions are hyperactive or are little co-hibited; when our brain is warm, but also when there is no stimulus.
Drugs can cause this state as well as brain damage or psychics.
But also the restriction of stimulls, stress, love evil or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, until a third of the questionnaires had experienced at least once in the life.
In the summer 2005, Sarah K. had 16 years of age, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania and attended a secondary school collection.
A hurry girl.
If it wasn't for these images and the voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, a boy's torpe with a long and dark, leads him the word.
When she answers, the other students look at her suspicious; no one, besides her, hear or see the boy.
They think the girl's a little strange teacher, but Sarah K. knows he's not dreaming.
He's ridden and seeing and listening to that boy, as you see, and listen to the girl sit down on the bank on the side.
You may even feel your presence, at least some moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Sometimes you're wondering if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and are gone.
By nights, the appearances are alarming.
We're at the 64 crash.
When in class sometimes you can't follow the lesson because the teacher – at its eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest explains the mathematic equations in a visible way and hearable.
By nights, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes late and is low, you don't know whether you're disappointing or dreaming, if the images that you see, the munchs or the girl with bloody cuts in arms and legs, they appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, cry them to the figures.
Your parents and friends haven't told you anything, they would believe it's crazy.
August 2009, Sarah K. has 20 years today.
He adopted last year selectivity and lived with her girlfriend.
A year ago the alucinations have lost.
Since you have entered contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, you know it's not crazy.
The crazy is also a work of art by desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a time it starts to have alucinations.
I think the brain is uncomfortable and it is responsible for the same to search for entertainment.
Sarah K., one daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His alucinations started when, with 13 years of age, it was known that the man whose father called his father since he uses the reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acute alucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and sound impressions, to the affected ones like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten says, "have a place in the brain, the reality is designed there.
The alucinations are also images that the brain produce, so they look so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of alucination.
The alucinations of healthy persons are not different from the fundamental of the aguded psychics.
Instead of skizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as irreal.
Casten recommends that your patients appreciate their alucinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and alucination
in this too well-conscious world, imaginary experiences are generally pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Catholic in Heidelberg, and doctor head of the psychiatric and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but also involves something positive and creative – the crazy is an art work of dispersion.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the called unirism, a special form of conscience, which is seen as a dream.
Honical alucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the experienced person considers real and that later cannot differ from being disappointed.
Onyric conscious states are in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as patients with polyrchronics Europeans, who experience a motor paralysis and are fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of itself or of the world because of a total and permanent motor incapacity, this replaces a real dangerous situation by a own and imaginative world that is uncommon of reality.
A form of limited situation between dream and alucination.
Since a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is produced, although the real situation is still present in imagination.
A intense way to make sense and interpretation to an inadequate situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to get away from nothing of the loss of conscience.
All is real, even later in memory
The artist of art Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, describes his honourable experiences in his book of heart changes as an action for the salvation of the soul.
It was 49 years old, when her conscience was shocked in travels several days after a operation of the hearts with an inclusive heart transplant, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the station of intensive care.
Claussen was a world created by the same and visited foreign places of other times: he was posted in bed, a man who was a higher in the board of a sanitation in a train, a robot watched for his health.
It was seen in the high age of media, rounded by nobles that produced drugs from blood.
A Greek surrounded him in his country of origin, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alpes with fire nest and found him with a mafious Korean.
It gives everything in these imaginative facts, everything is real, even later in the memorys.
For Claussen, these internal trips are fundamentally different than any dream.
Sounding is a different state, thus describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memory of mental travels is, many years later, much more clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our cotidian experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, ambirism, psychics, alucinations and drug consumption show that it is the internal reproduction of the external reality, even when we are disappointed.
Each change of the state of conscience resumes the psychologist Kasten, "you can bring to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that, on the other hand, may be completely enriching.

Burden
Children will be responsibilities of the editorial with 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become a patriarch for 27 years and have the strong will of entering the company, confirmed Burda, from 69 years of age, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been corrected as a precaution measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained for that.
One can't put 7.500 workers to his children, if they are not sufficiently trained for it.
That would end with children and with the company.
Burda was aware of the Thursday that will be retired from January of the Presidency of the Joint Directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, from 52 from 1999, is a member of the Burda address.
At the beginning he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was incarcerated from the treasure and was responsible for the heritage of the company. After the outcome of Jürgen Todengrandfer was also charged by the direct marketing, foreigner, printing and financial marketing.
For the first time, no member of the family is employed by the editorial couspide.
The children of Burda have 19 and 17 years of age, and her son Felix, who now had 42 years of age, died some years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves, " saving the differences of 10.15 years" according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda showed that the family companies are not safe from the decade: "This has always affected families that have stopped counting by the capital search faham, who have judged badly and thought that they could be higher as well as the largest player.
It has never been my strategy.
I've never had a "deliver of greatness", says Burda.
I don't see me as a political precepter of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world's link; these business have been too big.
Integral beauty
All that - in the question of beauty and well- you can want, at the range of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed the English Court, which has just been inauguring a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, situated in the plant, accounts with prestigious signs such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation -; Spaxion, with ethical relaxation rooms and treatments; Luis & Tachi Pelukeros; Marina d'Or, which has a gymnase, or the Western and its natural cosmetic, among others.
There is also a food section, which highlights the teater, with more than 130 different classs of this infusion.
Discover from a relaxed massage with your couple while you consider the greatest views of the capital, or rent the relax area for two hours to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxers with a jacuzzi session, masks and taking a champagne copy are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms for the latest and newest facial, corporal and hydrotherapy treatment.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight celulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gymnase also contain these machines, in addition to some virtual trainers that are leading to customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything begins by introducing your personal key into a tactil screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and extracts) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to pass through the peculiarity, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, lightness or personalized nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to have been the premises of this urban space, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 from morning to 22:00 of night.
Variable selections
It is about the Christmas and is never more to repass the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party clothes.
The form of the scout, very important to realize the siluet, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There are some suggestions.
Fergie songer elected a exagerate and very complicated scoot. It's not very advisable.
Finsa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Finish electricity company, together with the Barcelona Jointing, has created the LIVE Office.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalonia capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistic for Electric Vehicle Installation) will define and coordinate the road sheet for the installation of electric cars in the city and reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, subventions, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will develop, promote electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to stimulate what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric citizens'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implantation of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are subject to the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government within the MOVELE Plan to stimulate the inplantation of the electric vehicle.
The final electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Catalonia Autonome Community.
Among these, energy-related activities would be found and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which finally participates in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Sapatero see 'a horizon of calmity' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobilistic industry, which, remembered, is the main exporter sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the Government Chairman, Zapatero reaffirmed the measures laid down by the Executive Board during the biennium to support the car sector.
"In the Automotive Competitive Plan, today we would have a displacement monitoring, shut some of our main productive plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thank you to this plan and the disposal of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporter sector," added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integrated Automobilization Plan (PIA), was designed 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 assistant companies, which mobilized more than 3,000 million euros.
The Executive Chief explained that this investment was undertaken both for the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the Government's support measures to request, in the 2000E plan, implemented in collaboration with autonomy communities and automobilistic brands.
According to the Chairman, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spanish markets to reduce the 6 per cent of the matriculation, which increased "40 per cent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Coast Hall will be held, a meeting space for engine professionals and afixed professionals.
This initiative will be developed during the 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pabell of the Camp of Madrid House.
This is a exposure surface of 20,000 square meters, where there will be more than 200 national and international exposures.
It is not only possible to find classic motors and cars, but it will be found in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the publishers of the pavilion, accessors, channels, components, textile accessors, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motor that will make the deceits of collegeists and curiose collegeists.
Among the participating enterprises will be found Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Joan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and reconstruction of cars; or Cochera Classic, specialist Mercedes Benz.
External ability tests
In addition, the trade activities of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: concentrations, sports exhibitions, availability tests, presentations and competitions.
There will also be evidence of ability with classic cars and motorcycles in a circle enabled outside the phenomenon.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sport
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sports are not respected by environmental respect.
Thus, you have finished entering the Mazda3 stop and starting engine-building system as i-Stop-, a device that is at least available at the moment only with 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 highlights the good note reached throughout its entirety.
The ends, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanic, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are overseas in the new Mazda3.
By starting by the conducting position, we confirm that the front bottles present an excellent ergonomy and subjection.
Also, the board of the flight is exquisite.
Following the set of the instrument table and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a future future design, with a large number of bottles and commands and call colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of which also presents the Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sovereignty of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to fight.
Continuing with the habitat, this Japanese compact presents more habitat than enough to travel to four adults with a higher comfort level.
All of this is summarised by a comprehensive and regular shape.
The motor stop and automatic starting system, at least at the moment, is available only with the 2 litre gas motor and 150 horses and the manual change of six walks.
This engine is a real delicate delicia. Overseek by its end, by its reduced roumority, for performance and by making content consumption.
And it is that although the most requested Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not realize a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with gas motors, both for their high driving comfort and for their content.
With regard to the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the named Sport, which includes a larger number of series elements.
From the supersalal series equipment, especially the carrile change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the sensitive inside spot, the board computer in a large size screen, the switch sensors, the swimming sensors, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio and 17 pulses.
Furthermore, if it was little of your equipment, this version was counted with the Premium Pack, which added by EUR 1.500: making adaptive bixenon and BOSE audio system with disk loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts of the category.
It is particularly highlighted by the quality of employed materials, by their conduct and by the high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not realize many km per year can opt this i-Stop version, associated only with 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between the 21.770 euros of the final Luxury and the 23.270 euros of the test version - Sports-.
In change of this high number, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Low 'premiere'
L. A. covers the red flat of sensitivity of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars sneaked more than ever in the elegant models like 'sexys' in the star of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', sophisticated as a habitat, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the email, without even seeing a certain type of attachments or browsing via the network.
He disappointed his five-minute famous in the U.S. when the Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is harder, truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for youth.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low month share, less than half than it is paid, for example, by the data plan of iPhone.
As the company has successfully saved two new devices: one only thought for Twitter, the other has a free life data service in change of paying six times more by Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the Le Web event, is the European version of the invent and its third incarnation.
It's equal to limited than your United States counterparty, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of approximately 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with smartphones already know what is to stop the data when crossing the border or looking for an unexpected café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to visit the email.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attracted and a long time ago it would have to be in function.
Yes, some operators have special travel agreements and travel plans, but in my experience there is no need for a physician to understand them and a good gift to read the small letter.
The repeated ears from the European Commission to achieve available roaming tariffs for all Europe have had a perceived effect.
Out of the country of origin is fear to use the data, and with reason.
That a device such as FonPeek (does not be wonderful that the name of the Fund takes when no Wifi) makes this type of tariffs means that the operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which their data network loves.
Childle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet consultations.
No contracts and no gates.
It's a connected device and it's paid for it when buying it, not a month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a buy option with life access like Peek has already in the U.S.
Not because she's going to buy him.
I'm looking at my phone, thank you.
I hope it is because I think it is a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle Fetics Colour
The amarillo is, uncertainly, the favorite ton of the first American woman.
If he has already accompanied Barack Obama's possession as President of the United States with a clothes and a framework of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in the second most important moment of his life: the collection of it in the Nobel Prize of Peace.
Michelle Obama has brought a very similar model in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green with brilliant reflections - the two times the acting was composed of three pieces - sweet, sweet and under the same screen, and slept with a large round or collar.
So, at first, it seemed that the first woman of the United States followed the star of the Prince of Asturia and had chosen to repeat the vestaurie.
But the screen in which the two clothes are confected makes them very different.
If for the ownership of a strike, in Oslo is a third-party with shocked.
The supplements have also varied: green shoes of mid-tacon on the other time, and a similar model, but enormous, now.
And it is also the penite: a collector in this case, melena succels the previous.
75 per cent of labour mothers have had working problems for their motherhood
Discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the youngest generations who want to be mothers.
In this way, the study “Fecunity and Labour Traictory of Women in Spain”, elaborated by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women Institute.
The survey between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years is not doubtful: 75 per cent of labour mothers had been limited to the employment opportunities because of maternality.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of couple consumption and the number of children, based on whether they work or not, and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside their home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start before conviction in couple, leading to the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay the conviction and maternity, and have less descendants.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age of fixed work have the first child, average, 3,7 years after living, which increased to 4,1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their vital trayectory to achieve them, which has led them to put children's unity and arrival.
Furthermore, the type of work exercises a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the calendar of the employee," explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another of the factors that differ the age of women when we married and have the first vague.
According to the survey, how large it is the educational level, it is the age to whom they are married and who have the first son.
The difference remains also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, the primary and higher studies have been mothers first at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Another division is set for women on the basis of their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first son before getting a stable job, the media or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtain a stable work as a condition before marriage and arrival of a child," details Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth
Oreal Paris has finished summoning a new name to its envoy list of embassy: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actor will become a image of various brand products, shooting the universal 'for I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Christmas', one of the most elegant actors of the international panorama, is one of the other famous figures of the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the latest in the same selective club were the actors Evangeline Lilly ('Perdidos') and Freeda Pinto ('Slumdog Millennium').
In the male paragraph, the cosmetic brand also accounts with luxurious embassy embassyrs: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Perdidos').
British Mode Prices
The Britishs have much to say in the mode world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today, were meeting in the annual delivery of their prizes, held in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody spoke to the quote.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Annual Model.
Manuel Vicent Poker
Manuel Vicent regrets in 'As Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a train of writer radiographies that have passed through their literary life (and in cases also by the other).
It does not in the predictable and fearable genders (biographic, life and work), but looking for something similar to the illusion of the creator's character.
The journey has its excitations and Vicent does not smell summers or illuminations.
Besides an exquisite enjoyment, the book is a comfortable invitation to read and recreation.
Here I leave you some instantaneous.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual cleaning, almost physically, the same thing I felt without giving him a name: the joy against the action, the moral without guilty and the innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhihilist, the allieric Christian, wrote what was in blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a slumping poetic humor, without sense, like the shelter of the shoe that I was at the point of killing him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was injured by this woman with a patience that was thirty years old, in which flesh condemned adultery’s emotion with the enjoyment of the correction, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching the heaven through the way of loss."
About James Matthew: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousands of meters of universal literature, which must be scaled through the northern wall, from which the best alpinists are once again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a rare guy.
Similarly, somewhat he said he was a heritage of a terrain and others that was a son of a black and cocodrile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry from a bridge launched by that character of Munich to bring his eco to the background of the 19th century's letterary form and made it on a trip fleeting from himself and calling the posterity with a violent talk to the gusanos."
About Dorothy Parker: "A day it was put out of rodles and replied, 'Dear God, I ask you to stop writeing as a woman."

About Virginia Wolf: "The team also brought his depressions.

The case of a so patient and loving man has never been given a neurotic whose literary talent was before his crazy."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos just treat inocular to Cœdès in Baroja?
What did Benet try to pass Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?

Cobard aggression
Last week, my mother of some 70 years of age passed through our barrier in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of youths between 15 and 18 years passed with her and our dogs, a mestious example of race, saved from the dog and not more than six kilos of weight and, without medium-spot, propined him two patches that left the bad dog.
Our wrath is massive because we do not find the difference in a free aggression to a small and indefensive animal, which was indeed affected.
To this, there is a need to add the sofoco that caused him to a woman who was tranquilly passing and that, when he increased these individuals, was afraid of their physical integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do it itself with a woman, a child, an elderly, or, finally, with any weaker than he himself.
The event occurred at five of the morning's morning for a traditionally quiet barrier.
The dog was crying all day.
Indeed, we made a complaint in a neighbor committee, which we doubt it serves for a long time and not to generate subsequent ability, just clarifying that the murdered cobardes were Spanish.
Anger has caused us to declare this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among youths to consider diverted to be distracted freely to an indefensive animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the castle
Michelin' manufacturer, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial), has started a campaign to promote the use of the castle, especially among the youngest engineers, today reported both entities.
This initiative seeks to acknowledge the importance of use of the castle, since it is the only protective element to avoid injury in the head, or even the death in the case of a accident while it is circled in a motorcycle.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the vial security, which "is more than designing and manufacturing more safely products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this target through other activities of pedagogy and informative nature.
This new box-use campaign in the motorcycle, under the 'Tobe or not to be', will be the first stage in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle tanks, with the aim of reaching the maximum dissemination.
To end, Michelin emphasized that vial safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a neomatic manufacturer for two road vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more secure products.
Under the sale of light commercials
About two years later, the market of low commercial vehicles began to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were matriculared in November in Spain represent a decrease of 12.6 per cent in 2008, and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to the numbers of the Anfac manufacturers and the Ganaba manufacturers' manufacturers.
The good date, not as well, should be put it in quaren, since the reference to which the comparison is compared - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decline of 60% in respect of the previous year.
The result of this is that, despite the reputation of the last month, matriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below the previous year.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold all vehicles composing the chain of the light commercial chairs: the derivatives of tourists, pick up, trucks, light cars and light cars/legal cars.
Nevertheless, the nubarones who have more affected their demand, as even though they are also acquired by particulars, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, restrictions with the closed grip of bank credits must be made to other factors such as increase in the balance levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Before this panorama and from the tourisms, the aid for the purchase of 2000E was little.
They can be accompanied, in addition to particulars, by autonomys and pymes that are going to purchase a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Last night, from Ganales, they recalled the need to provide special attention by the administration to these vehicles and also to industrials (cames and buses).
The association of salers pronounced a 2010 similar to the year ended, which calculates a fall in sales (tourism and 4x4) of 19 per cent.
The assistance to the emergency driving is already binding
As occurred with the ABS freight antiblock and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency assistance systems will be a binding element in European cars.
Indeed, it is already in all light trade vehicles of new matriculation, while for the rest, a deficiency period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed at enhancing the protection of peatants, however, in their way of working, can also help to avoid many colisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency fresh is to increase the pressure on the fresh in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the shoe that the driver gives.
But this is not always maintaining that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to push the train before the colision and half of them did not use the whole force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the contrary, requires the maximum shipping system by reducing the distance that uses the car to stop.
According to a EU study, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, death accidents could be avoided by year to 1.100 involved peatones.
The reduction will be even greater - it will be calculated that one of the four males would be avoided with damage to people - when popularized the called intellectual systems of emergency fresh.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that (with a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the fresh.
If the driver reacts, helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If you do not react, and although colision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort to minimize damage.
General motors turn up to January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in April at the first week of April - the 8 most likely day - reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warned that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly says, the new President of Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously consented by the affected party.
This can make the definitive document that will be subjected to workers first and after the Governments of the countries where there are factors is turned to the beginning of 2010.
Instead, since GM, a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
This is not strange that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision soon.
GM admits to have contact with some new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who could also try to purchase Volvo, but cooks the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Converg Group.
In the case of no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to China Baic.
The decision is to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
To the flight of Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and charity of joya, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a basis and achieved adding anything less than 80 kilos, which has left the basket in only 1 275 kilos.

Your behaviour can only be qualified by intakeable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not put the asfalt with apple.
However, it was the contrary: it was time that we did not test such a small and slight model that, once, I sent so much security on the curve step, even to high speeds.

Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.
The sound of your V6 booxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be strengthened with the 'sport' option and through a system that changes the motor bramide, which is already extraordinary in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stop or in recovery.
Suspendences are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asfalt of the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car did well the bags.
Electronic aid only made an act of presence on the whole traject, and that's that in some curves we find glass in amazing and gravity, already in the morning.

Basconia is a victory in Israel
The Labour Labour achieved a brilliant triumph by 82-91 in his visit to the complex Maccabi Electra's low clip, despite the numerous lows with which the Dusko Ivanovic team was, and thus it was located in the leader of its group, after the great action of Mirza Teletovic, which was the best of its team (29 evaluation).
The victorian team summarized the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov, with large doses of impact and collective work, even though he had to suffer until the end to make the victory.
Furthermore, the big axle from the perimeter, with 16 well-known trials, had much to see in the final triunfo.
The party began from face to the blue green, which took place from the start by front in the marker.
The four first victory canasts came from the circle already shocked that they had shooted the Israeli shoot with the warm munchs..
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second fourth was more than the same, but the alabous team opted by the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pits and applauses in the return to his home, to continue extending its advantage to the relax (34-43).
Teletovic began to emphasize as the best of your team with 13 points, although the 'minute six' of Splitter' evaluation had already been slaughtered that it would not be the best night of Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarcered in the rest, was not decided, nor was it much less, and the macabeers wanted to remember the victories that in his song did not win any one, and with 'Elias' hand opening up to the party.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively contributing to the "amarillos" back to the light (50-49).
More Inconvenients
The Ivanovic's, but not much less dead, needed to swim a couple of games with a sweet to cook air, and in those arrived the ametrallator of Mirza Teletovic, who had three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a quiet income (54-67), which could maquillate locals at the end of the third fourth (57-67).
The sheep came to leave the skin in the last part and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone leave what had been done during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of your team did not resign and tried to keep their team from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by lack, the Ivanovics did not cut up, defended well, and although the Israelites approached in the final minute (80-85), the party had already been slaughtered and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time.
The lesions impede to fight the Unicaia
The Unicaya strictly lost in Greece before the Olympics and ced him the leader of the Euroliga Group, in a party marked by the lows of the castists, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The malignant team was not assaulted by the environment of the Pabellion of Peace and friendship, and not by the rival entity, perhaps by the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first fourth was allowed to dream the journeys. A aggressive and three consecutive trial, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillerm Rubio, disrupted the 12-18, minutes 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaya, although the architecture of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned back to the Marker 22-20, minutes 13, at which a struggle action, between the two US bases Beverley and Williams, was suppressed the discalling of both players.
The Greek set started functioning by showing its superiority within both areas, where the low injury by the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal failures of Carlos Jimenez, were delaying the boxers.
Among the internal players and the Lituan Aero Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the benefit 44-32, minutes 19.
An unable remount
The third period was very absurd with the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and even even the difference of the meeting discussed in Málaga 66-48, minutes 27, which made the lead of the group.
The Unicaya tried to overcome the absences and the latest low of the shock Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all inconvenients, the Unicaja for the direction and trials of Cookie, and Lewis' contribution, there was some hope of 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was almost impossible because the Olympics were shocking and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unfavourable.
The croata pivot Nikola Vujcic was able to remont the average basket 81-62, minutes 37, and the Unicaja was removed, delivering the leading to the Olympics.

Brazil places the outdoor of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set his duration to the remaining of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Chairman must leave the diplomatic license until 27 January 2010, when officially completed his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for businesses of the embassy in the Honduras capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that it must go before that date of the embassy, where she remains refugee since September 21.
"He has conscious that he must be out on January 27, when completed his mandate, he must find another destination."
The employee also quoted the former mandate, who confirmed his intention to get out of the embassy before the deadline: "My position is going out as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya stated on the telephone way.
After the elections of November 29 (when was elected by Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that it would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by refusing Zelaya the condition of political asylum to imposing the Government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the wine and rose days from spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, the uncertainty returns to the markets, which should not be surprised since it is their natural status, in an environment where agents take decisions on the future for uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was monetating debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly gives free liquidity bar next to zero types so that financial entities purchase active assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchase of assets has practically completed and, without questioning its hypothetical liquidity policy, they start to earn some sand in the grain as the ECB has done with its asset in the next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without so-called measures and we are assisting a reverse of risk prime reduction.
The volatilities of the Bols and the differences of the good corporates have returned, although they are still very distant from the paranormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize the private risk, and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality, and the U.S., Japan and Germany have been the relief elected by investors, resulting in an expansion of the differences in the euro zone countries regarding Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability, but it came to Standard & Poor's, and has introduced a new review to the lowest qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of incertitude is not bad to highlight the moral defenders who tried to re-establish awareness about the responsibilities of the global economic policy because they have cut the destructive effects resulting from the credit restriction on employment destruction, when what should be done is decrease a new day of Thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, the Dubai's tribal struggle is a tribal struggle between emblems to recompense the power in emits and Greece, which we have already seen it before.
A government who hides public deficiency, elections and a new government that is cut off.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duran Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin saved Hungary from an incompliance of its external payments at the beginning of the year and will allow a Member State to comply with its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to comply with its citizens with the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we are expected, we find before a normalization episode of cross-risk primes, after some exemptions in locked positions, would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are wide as the good European corporates should not be worried.
If European differences decreased and our continued expansion, it would be a Spanish idiosinclastic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anoded. When our advanced indicators are bound to most studies services to anticipate their recovery scenarios for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which return to the load of a Japanese scenario for Spanish economy, does not give a lot of hopes of life to their warning.
Once again, it's all the painting that will be a excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the time "prudance, conductor friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene last night before the subcommission of the Congress of Members in which the Spain's energy strategy was discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, he followed the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few paintings of what had been drawn in the undercommission to the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest $50,000 to 2020 and other 60,000 million from that date to 2030, provided that the nuclear centers are open to function today.
Not so, the necessary investments will be not of 60,000 million, but from 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investment should not be intended to increase the capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes and will already need to increase power.
It is focused on gas plants and carbon with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, they think they need 18.000 new MW, that's, with other "support energy".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Act which has just been adopted by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which opposes climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term position" in this regard, despite the "puntal" measures, as he called the President of Iberdrola.
As a fire, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should start taking soon in maturity and need a stable reward framework to address them.

Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it makes a clear income difficulty if it is not through the acquire of a local construction signature.
A strategy that has followed the quotes Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be depending on the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position on that market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, the Leighton's provision.

Game Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Barza from its origin
The League of Campeones has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
As far as Real Madrid and Barcelona have income 476,4 million since then, what makes them the third and fifth club that more money have won in competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Ganning the EUFA Campeones' Liga offers glory not only. It is also one of the main sources of income of the large clubs.
In this way, competition has shared 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 Spain teams (12 of them) which have participated in the event since the tour was established in the 1992/1993 period, according to EUFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this apartment.
The white club has been the third of the continent, which has been more money to participate, and the only, next to the AC Milan, who has tried to win the trofee.
The catalan, the future champion and the last winner of the extensive Copa of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of classification.
The list leads it to the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams that, in addition, made more money to participate in the past Championship.
And that, although you lose both front Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through Champions, although it has achieved more titles than any other (5 through Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex monetary distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this exercise, the body presidend Michel Platini expects to include 1,090 million by the League Champions.
From this money, the EUFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including Madrid Atlantics) received 2,1 million.
Furthermore, those who have been able to participate only have been 3.8 million, in addition to 550,000 euros for each party that conflicts.
There are also bonus to win (800,000 euros) and by empatar (400,000 for each team). The octavofinists will get three million each; eight four-finists, 3.3 million.
The four lasts will be borrowed by 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, in front of the 5,2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in the concept of fixed payments, a club will income at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barcea was borrowed to win Europe's Supercopa in August.
But it is also the variable payments, which are intended for 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spain is the main ones, and has four allocated places.
The sampling of the previous year is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the room.
The other party shall be paid according to the number of parties played in the edition of this year.

New tools to perite cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, they won not only car tanks.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a miscarriage are remoted to a Taller, where a expert must evaluate the damages suffered and what will be the reparation cost.
Nothing left is equal, and the calculation of piece costs and the time of work may be a long and complicated work.
Calculate manually the cost of a reparation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the most recent computer instruments, the question would be

It's a very sweet work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and introduced its price.
Furthermore, each model is performed a "intelignant" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be drawn.
If it is a venture model, the work can be ready in one week if the process is very fast.

Last October, the Solera group purchased Autoonline, a internet platform for sales of cars such as swimming motes or special vehicles.
The operation summarized by 59.5 million euros per 85 per cent of the capital of society, which could be extended to the remaining 15 per cent of the year.
The objective of purchase was to provide more value services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a large international market.
This evaluation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as assurance companies, experts, rental companies, talents, debts and professional sellers that should be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets highlight Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web is currently accounted with more than 1.500 registered salers and 4.000 experts.
3.000 daily advertisements are managed and the Spanish market includes some 100 new ads every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of bathrooms has been given low can not be circled again, but can be used as some pieces that are not damaged.
The cars with historic value can be given up, even though they have been low after a slightly handling.
Budget to pay in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user obtains a budget in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the rechange, create budget and generate budget.
The use facility is an essential conditioning for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, which are often more reactions to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 all-term motors, 137 motors, 78 cars and 44 cars.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with Internet connection.
Once the model is identified by its switch number, a real graphic image of the model concerned appears and then the necessary change is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the work hand, loans or discounts, and may then print the budget to deliver the customer.
AidTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but better a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that the loan orientated does not include estimated time of work.
The use cost of this instrument for the loan is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
The Audatex company currently works so that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and give it back to see the inside face.
