28-year-old coch in San Francisco Mall to develop
A 28-year-old coch, who was recently taken to San Francisco, was discovered in the house of a local sales centre.
The brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "the end of the time it went back with him."
The body name found in Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Gallicia from San Francisco, and shared the directional medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was killed as a murder and the investigations are in the course.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, shared the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco with Frank, who had worked previously as cooked in Boston, had his dream worked as a cook in the Sons & Droits Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Sons & Democracy said she was "shocked and destroyed on the ground".
"We're a small team that works like a close family and we're gonna lose him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and concerns are in this serious time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank first lived in hostels, but "the things finally went to the mountain for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," she shared with Louis Garcia KGO.

He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His type to bind with his family was to always cook us to prepare our dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of interference.
He was the brother who blew with the electric.
"For all things that runs in the world, he was this unclean diamond that lighted every day," he said.

Jennifer Anistones: I'm always shooted in shoes
Jennifer Anistones must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star clearly in an interview now.
"I will always be shooted in shooters or beat from external labels that are mostly little to do with me and the reality."
"I have no desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Really said, these things are worse to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only smile that it applies as "Miss Perfect" as it says in the current "cosmopolitan".
In fact, the shooting players shrink their time at home, forming television with locker dust and mexican food, namely in the magazine.
To the white glut she asked the child's desire: "We women must not be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is to see a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives sport pyramide
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little disappearance with a swift on the beach.
For 58 years it was a premier.
CHIO: "Goldene sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses recalled their feier, and they gathered in the fast gallopp home to the food trails.
A mile at this time, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's why the reit carriage ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfers were all times - 101 Tourisms - again near horses.
He went to his family about the ALRV installation, and he wasn't weaking up to a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen, and so also at the CHIO.
The reason was convinced.
The German sports aid delivered the man from house in a small gala the goldene sport pyramids.
No signs lack of the sympathical sporter.
Federal Service Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has joined him.
The 18th prices of the sport pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first priceholder Hans Days Winkler on Saturday.
"This marking is very important to me," says Langer, "if it will be forgiven not only for sportive success but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer promotes the education.
And so he also gave the price payment of EUR 25,000.
Another 15 wonderful sporting students was included on Saturday on the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
The magnificents include the slightest Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Colbe, Bob-Fahrer Myhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the springer Alwin Schokem√∂hle and the posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderfully.
Many of these sports members came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illuminated society moved to the spring stadium where the Lavazza price went.
Bernhard Langer was a distance to the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, one of the two US Chairpersons is in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a basic, more philosophical difference.
That's about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep the people in doubt more smaller and warns how the State of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.
However, he would be very different, says Trump.
He will raise regulations massively, and makes himself for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates, for privates and for businesses.
Clinton, however, says: The State has to fulfill certain tasks, he has an opportunity to open and needs money.
That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the theme infrastructure.
In which you should be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost anything.
The Democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state critical Teaparty flags of the Republicns.
Thus, on Trump, there could be even part-party discussions.
People are the differences in the energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal powers and restore carbon production in the United States.
Oil promotion is also to be possible in protected areas that it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, however, wants to develop the renewable energy with its investment programme and calls for: "A country will be the super power of cleaner energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's probably going to be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in the infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.
TPP, the transpacify trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, both the United States will not isolate the international trade - but just protect American jobs.
Then they should be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum loan of 7.25 US Dollar is a huge loan.
He wants to increase $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum loan must be slow, then he says that he should not be changed.
However, the broad debate of the next months should be more important to develop the tax policy of the two loans.
On the one side, the trumpet is which wants to decide the economy and the citizens to cultivate growth.
His critics are to keep him so that the budget deficit would be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least the riches, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution.
Fire: "Ever flighted woman has experiences with sexual violence."
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee only, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumated.
A house offers refugees.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is up to one year.
One put her little son into the arm.
He's incredible with great eyes in the room.
His mother is on the table plate.
Until she notices she's watched.
She's laughing short and sweet the little ones.
The scene works normally.
Before you talk to Katrin Bahr.
It is a sector business leader of Condrobs, a firm for social aid offers in Bayern, and is employed with the subject of women on the fleet.
The four women in the kitchen are flights.
They live in the Middle North in one of the few decental accommodations for single-fleet women and their children in Bayern.
In January Condrobs, the establishment was held together with Pro Familia and the Muncher Women's aid.
Until long, she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There is no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a watchman before the door.
"It's not over to say: Every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence on her fleet," says Bahr.
"Mans run for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened by torture or death, or because their families send them into Europe."
Other reasons for the fleet are overwhelmed by women: "A lot of people are shooting from home because they do not see any other way."
In their homes, they have experienced sexual violence, pregnancy, honor, slavery or pregnancy prostitution.
That's what she's going on.
It's on the flight.
"The slapper, for example, calls for sexual acts, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they're not protected by their families.
Who believes that it ended when they come to Germany, it's irreversible, Barr.
The only women in refugee accommodations would often be considered less valued and the worst infringement.
This results that about 90 percent of women who live in the northern municipality are traumated, it is estimated.
" Some of the children have not certainly been voluntary."
Many women are so common that they say nothing.
"or they don't believe to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too large."
As she often don't know how to help, there is only more accommodation for her, she calls barr.
In Bayern the seven district governments are responsible for the submission of refugees.
The question whether they know about a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities is not answered with some.
There is no way in government accommodations.
In Schwaben, only refugeed women are not subjected to separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the Government's speaker.
In top bathrooms, under- and medium-sized hospitals, there are Stockworks or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exemption is the Netherlands, there are two central accommodations only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women separated from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be hidden separately."
"If the privacy is uncommon, or men and women will join, it may be too - continuing - violence against women."
In particular, the wash spaces should be separated and easily available for women are available in the study.
How much the women are doing this protection needs, you can be given on the Andrang, which it is on the house in Munich.
"When we talked about it, we have a long wartelist," says Bahr.
It's easy to draw up a second house.
Assistant physicians: Requirements to new work camps
The advisers of the physicians have called on their association to appoint new working combats in their strictness with regard to a new treaty.
The Juneor Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) requested its entire Council to authorize more work-up measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that the Minister would have agreed to address the concerns relating to the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a treaty agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected from 58 % of his members who voted at the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would be "speakly" to problems, which resulted in the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC has agreed to completely suspend the proposed new treaty and request official negotiations on all of your concerns."
As a response to the Government's swimming point, the JDC Administration has today made a formal request to a specific meeting of the BMA Council to authorize a current programme of scaling workshops that begins in September.
The strictness resulted in the sixth strikes this year, the first total accidents in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the treaty conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings still before voted by 54.000 assistant doctors and medical students, with the view that the treaty should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty on Medicines would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: "A Aliance of Foreign Seaers?"
It was a spirit that ended a crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey were meeting on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months a long-term war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposers in the covenant hall of St. Petersburger palast, I can't imagine that Ankara wants mostly to condemn this condemnation.
There was the shooting, yeah.
But Putin's laugh worked smellly, and he distracted little warmness, even for his remaining situation.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his " loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't tell it anymore.
He also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but also improved.
On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would be called as if it would never happen anymore.
I look like his exhusiasmus shows the opposite.
But one of Putin's extraordinary, sustainable kits showed that the head of the State had nothing forgotten.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the cutting of a Russian fighting instrument on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Mocaus reaction at the time was burned.
Putin divide and accused Ankara to be cast into the back.
The conduct was even greater, since it began from a pleasant friend.
Reconstruction of the vetration will be difficult if not even possible.
The public opinion in Russia has turned into place since November.
For months, stately controlled media have caused a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara.
On one occasion, it seemed like the Turks would take the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accused of leaders were that Erdogan‚Äôs own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian areas that were controlled by the Islamic State.
He's struggling this.
But in St. Petesburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apologize he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapon stand are clearly on the hand.
However, first-line, all the friends he can get after his last month in a deceived state status almost take place.
Repeat terrorist attacks against Turkey have also shocked him.
But there is also economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have taken the Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which generally brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coasts each year.
The number has decreased about 90%.
In Russia, travel events and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recovered again.
They are counting on a late seasonal adjustment to the Mediterranean.
This week prognosed the public vision of more than bill fruit and vegetables when the Turkish agricultural imports were re-accepted.
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "Tourists there long, tomates here long."
But the visit had a additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the western, since it considers its reaction to the tried power overcome as a weak answer.
The continuing crowd of the EU-accession negotiations and Putin, which is intended to take advantage of the cold stimulation and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.
The Russian Head of State wins in Ankara with security a bonus for requesting support for the chosen state bodies.
This is a self-consciousness for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime changes.
The meeting in this glass palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one of the ways it described an analytics, "Aliance of Foreign Seaers": two countries who disappeared from the western and treated badly and now engaged.
However, despite public condemnation, there are still large differences between the two.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently provided the role as a peaceful offender, but where Russia and Turkey supported contractual sides.
It could be noted that, after almost three hours on the first meeting, both Presidents on the press conference would have not ever discussed the topic.
The President of Turkey avoided responding to a question on its differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common namer to Syria can be found.
But after months of open enemy - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster than the NATO member of Turkey has taken the Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of State speak at least with each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Skotlands no longer available
Marke RBS is intended to be reduced by the head of the bank only to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Skotlands.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the Marke RBS was linked to the global areas of the bank.
The bank has been distant since it was almost collected and saved for eight years.
In this time, RBS marking strategies have been used to protect other final consumer financing brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from six United Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to turn more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the B√∂rsennotification to NatWest will be changed.
The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan has been interviewed during a board of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The brand RSB will be to our investor brands and to the brand where our employees will be employed, as we now become more to a bank of brands."
As the bank was only to a global market, RBS became the global market.
I now say that we are not global targets, but the local goals.
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something perfectly different and our employees will work with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sixth United Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the reliability of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the internal (which asked) to make this to a better bank for customers?" said the chief.
It would have been very cynic three years ago if we would have said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can restart these brands, so I think the time is coming.
Frankie Dettor reached his 3.000 winners at Newmarket
Dettori speaks of Champagner after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3.000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettor saved his 3.000 British wins at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on Predilection trained by John Gosden on his local renards with his second winning night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milk stone in the fleet.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-year-old victor, who wins on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I'm here 30 years ago.
It's not a great meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal freeday end with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very discreet.
Dettori takes the jubel when he gets the victory on prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestones in the hill - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached over 4,300 seats in a recruiting career.
Lester Piggott, who had a nine-year-by-by-earth carriage of 4.493 carriage
Frankie is one of the best jockey of moderns and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has just reached little before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intelligence, which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic messenger for rents, his exhusiasmus and Charisma has been shocking fans for these sports for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had helped 6000 wins if he wasn't only a weekend and big tourning jockey!
Frankie has been in GB almost 30 years of winner, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British journey, but also he is an incredible jokey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettor has been the escape of the British Flachreens for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of great tournament wins, including his famous "Glororeichen Seven" in Ascot 1996, but he also survived a aircraft abuse and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month spray, but he showed a impressive characteristic strength to fill his dubbles and return to his best form.
And he has not yet been at the end - the Dettor has previously said that he wants to continue with competitions to at least 50th year of life.
Russias Putin Stab Chef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly, left his head of office Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the most closest confidence circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Officer for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kreml, Putin has not indicated reasons "the release of Ivanovs from his obligations as President of the Russian Presidency".
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's Vice-President since 2012, was appointed to his follower.
Mono, 44. It's former diplomat.
1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he finished the named State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the website of the Kreml, it is (the Russian) that he was later Head of the Government staff.
For his name he said to Putin: "Thank for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your activities as the Head of State on legislation designs and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had requested to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Are the crazy faces convinced?
This step has made a secret place in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most closely trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he worked for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was extracted in the television, both men stated that the head of the stakeholder returned to his own desire.
But despite the laugh for the cameras, only few of these are convinced - especially now, short before the Parliament's choice.
So this is the consequence of a kind of power fight?
Nobody knows that now.
But the official statement - that a man who was first as a potential President wants to lead to the Russian environmental policy - is a big skepsi.
In his comments on Putin, which is sent on the website of the Kreml, Ivanov said "It is true that I prayed you in a conversation in the beginning of 2012, to trust me these very complex posts - you could say nearly - four years of confidence.
As it is clear, I am the President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the posts in December 2011.
Before he was the Defence Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin is a member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, as Putin President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his representative.
As putin at the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he mostly trusted.
First, Ivanov was accepted that after Putin's second official period could be President of Russia, since a third official period of Putin had been disfellowshipped against the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another close friend Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became President before he was returned to the President for three and a half years.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he tried producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical interview at the seat of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its advertising in a common opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, regretted himself on Thursday before the announcement of his proclamation.
In the Set, it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I blend the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how the Character Gibson is written from the series, following a FBI team, will be published in accordance with the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old-old-child played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been with it since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I had the last twenty-five years my whole heart blow in the sight," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but that's not possible now.
I would simply like to thank the authors, producers, players, our wonderful crowd, and especially the best fans you can want for a series.
The planned elimination of the twelve stake is set on the 28 September.
Racing for fish in gardens in Banff
A resident of Banff requested the identification of fishing aid in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that it could be the 75 fish on the sandale that were cut off by a spring brown.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could cut some light on the appearance of the two dull fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to fife
The ¬£ 1,35 billion tea project will be completed until May 2017
Ingenieurs have linked the north-deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck planes", which close to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The pound part of Fife is now 600 meters long and grows 30,000 tonnes.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of beton and 46 grains.
The ¬£ 1,35 billion tea project will be completed until May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economy, was a visit from the building today and was one of the first ones from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a really psychical measure in this project with over 30,000 ton Beton and Steel, which were used only for this part of the bridges.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the route and the bridge end is a heavy activity that requires extreme tolerances for the path.
Overall, almost 79 % of the whole bridge ends on their place and the last section of the box today in Rosyth is a part of the box, which means that the whole box is ready to be shocked on the bridges on its place.
Michael Martin, a project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first end is a significant milk stone at each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is an important high- and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road dishwasher and its connection with the northern Turmdeck found in the construction, we had to close the still existing clouds on the north or country side.
This has been reached by the seas of the northern bridges at the south of 700 billion.
This was a massive and simultaneous activity.
Massive, since the Viadut is 222 meters long, about 6.000 tonnes and was to be taken up at about 3%.
Hekel, since the tolerances on which the team worked, were changing - on each side they strike only a few billion meters.
Happyly, everything is very good.
Reservation in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Third to be alive"
Three men have "speaked to be alive," after they were cast by their fisher boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station took place on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crowd watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to shine in safe while their ship continued out of their own power.
"We saw the ship turned around towards herself and put us the worst place," said the chief of Moelfre Vince Jones' Saviation station.
"Nevertheless, the strong winds have shocked the ship out of their sky, until we leave to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fisherman boat while the third man was shocked in the age of 60 and was found on a good shock without saving west.
They all arrived at the board of the coastal boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were cast into the water have been unfortunately and still lived.
The boat engine had an emergency pill, but it was resolved at the ships of the man who controlled the ship.
Somebody has waited for these men today.
Strong - Man stands on his ex-amid in
A man has attacked his former friend in Hamburg-Harbourg with a shock and hard hurt.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old boys had received the key to the apartment to take his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized murders disappear the clothing of his former friend.
When he came to the apartment, he went into her twice.
The 44-year-old kids were injured in the hand and in the body.
The police could arrest the murder.
While the 50-year-olds destroyed the clothing of his former friend, he called his mother.
This alarmed her sister.
With their lives dangers, the 45-year-old boys wanted to calm their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lives.
On the street, they met the ex-life maritime of the man.
When the two women retraced the apartment again, the 50-year-old sister took his sister on the side and took his former friend.
Who builds swimming apartments?
I think the SPD and Green: the investors must be taken in the future much more.
How do we react to the bad news that swimming in the next few years will lose almost 1300 good apartments?
The SPD proposes a "concept of relief" at the next Council meeting.
But the strict is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who will actually build the favorite apartments?
There is no arrangement.
SPD Chairman Christoph Bratmann said, "We are joined with the green: Who wants to build on urban areas must present 20% of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the favorite apartments can also fall in stock.
However, the large point in the Council House is, Bratmann says, "What is going to do with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but it may be 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will be cost-building and financing for millions, is aimed at encouraging.
The problem is, so Bratmann: "These are still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make the investors a few rules as possible.
The left wants to be worse for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, the situation is strengthened in the apartment market.
If the action approach is implemented, it shall be ensured for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's not clear if we'll get the experts.
However, the program is not available: for about 1260 new apartments should be built without any other.
But how does it compare the loss of about 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will be made in the next years?
Only until 2020 will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now be purchased out of the city.
Moreover, it should be considered to get apartments back to the price connection.
This is possible in Western city.
On a shock, the problem resolved.
Because in the Western city, it's going to be the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price connection for favourable apartments.
Only: This does not want the owners, the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the Western city will be drastly increased, and it will be removed from the objective of the so-called processing.
A concentration of social weakness in only few cities should not be given.
The green claims that it will still be moved in the debate.
The President of the Group Holger Herlitschke says, "For a wide majority, the CDD must be in the boat."
It has focused on more buildings for individual homes.
But what does not mean that it is not yet possible to find a compromise.
Pokemon Go, a Jagd for Health and Happiness, who rejoice
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
That youths and kids do not go outside, but it is much better to take their free time to shoot on screens in the last decade of years.
In Pokemon Go, it is about to take people from Sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the television, then on video games and finally restricted on smartphones.
It is therefore nice to see that technology and activities are not excluding mutually.
I think of it self-conscious about the Pokemon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that first were created for video games in the 1990s (which later occurred a character trick series, game cards and other spin opens).
As many popular phenomenons, the interest in publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand starts July.
The marketing in other countries was moved by the mass demand that the server was overlooked.
In the meantime, Pok√©mon Go had more users than tender and almost so much as Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly said the players are walking out with their smartphones and searching for pokemons that are followed with a GPS and when they are found once, "fotographed" (for a screenshot on the phone) or "arried" can be taken.
A generation that played the game when she was younger, closed the shooting and spent for the search of the Sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that returns the "medial" person every day.
Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently shared Washington Post that within two days after marketing the game, the number of people who are following training each day from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know who's playing Pokemon Go - it only looks like the Roh data for increased performance.
Many public declaration campaigns for health that people want to "to take 30 minutes" and "come with Sofa" and "more to be active" are focused on babies ears, because many public news are disabled for health and from people who seem to be quiet.
However, the importance of sport cannot be exceededed.
Anyone who regularly takes sport reduces his opportunities to cure cancer or depression.
Physical confirmation helps the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to make them here.
But the wonderful Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something free to make them fun.
So three pillars of health will be discovered - movement, fresh air and sun appearance, and fun.
Some people close even new friendships on the jagd.
As always, there are more more players who have to be disappointed about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's going on?
It's a break.
Even if Smartphone apps were able to follow our activities before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose his journey and leave the use with time.
The success of Pokemons, however, will be given more games, which will be connected with the active competitors in the real world and that many people will help in the jagd, to be more active, fair and sinner.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dump
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hip.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamically on the floor.
Unfortunately on the balcony.
Food on the ground.
On the whole hand, brilliant line.
And now, finally, also the Olympiasier.
The 19-year-old American tournerin took place on Thursday to the multi-scale title and increased the lake between himself and the rest of the world before all the eyes under the Olympic Games.
Its total result of 62.198 was clearly before the Silver Medailler winners and the "Final Five" Mannation camera Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medailler winner Aliya Mustafin.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the Swiss bar during the individual swimming pool of women in the art tour at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth theeroexuel American, who wins a multi-floor combat title and totally sets her call to be the best of her generation or even even.
She showed her final result and found her long journey at this moment.
This success is in the same liga as unique athletes as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated their sport type in the last three years, 15 world medailles - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing practices that make a mixing of honor and precision that the Olympicsman of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said of her "the best tourner that I ever saw."
She expected a last test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between the Biles and the rest of the Athletes, but much more between her and a last overdimensional expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as an enthusiasm.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, after they win each gold and silver in the individual meal campfinal of women at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, 2016
Biles took the first medaille on Tuesday, while she served as an appeal mark at the dismissing feast, Martha Karolyi.
Although the Biles was there, while their long way on the pitches, never planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of their landworks, including their typical tumbling pass, is agreed on Latin America's music, which would be at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a accident.
This girl who was adopted as a little child by her grandma and found by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the Town Hall, in Boorman, was trained to be forced.
She has no longer lost competitive competition since summer 2013, a victory that will be stopped as long as Bales wants.
Even though mustafin was easy to lead through two shoes, the image was triggered.
Swimming bars and ground tours - in which Biles holds the world's majority.
She reared with 15,433 on the swimming bar and put up a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman surrounded her when she expected her snake - a pure form - and strike on a blue red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision which she first described in its collection book was realized.
Raisman's performance was a struggle last four years ago when she struggled around the third place, but the bronze medaille went to a helmet to Mustafine.
This time, the 22-year-old men's captain called "Oma" by the Americans had a pre-passion.
After their landwork, she was to be the public kitchen, exceeding a competitor that sometimes appeared doubtless.
As regards Biles, it has a very new importance for the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week:
Police: 3 victims in a series of murders at the music hearing in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girls who have been shot in one of the most dead attacks since a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder, while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an invasion, the authorities said.
The murder fired eight shoes from a handfire weapons, while he stood on the car's side and then fled with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police reported that the murder had not appeared to be the result of a shooting accident because the slaughter did not compact the hands or $2.900 that were at one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shoerei had the investigator in order to be closer to see whether it is connected to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in Spanish residences within four months in nine attacks and two more injured.
"It happens in a residence before a house," the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, shared the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a green nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to open the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and started by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elis's daughter Maleah are still dead.
One Witness shared the police that it was not uncommon to sit in a parked car and to hear music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shoesher, which led to a empty pickup track a half hour before the murder three times, and that it was the work of the series murderer.
The investigators found balls and secured a ball from the seat, as well as furniture from the motor space.
Mother of a 6-year-old man with microcephaly: "It will be better"
Like the most of the 6-year-olds Edmund Piccuto loves the song, game tools and of course his mother.
But as the least of his age, Edmund has microcephalie, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Piccuto didn't know during her pregnancy.
When he came home the first time, he was my first thanks, I don't do it.
I don't do it.
I didn't let it.
What isn't true -- of course you have left it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were informed that Edmund will never be able to recognise them under circumstances and that it may not be ever survived.
Some doctors were even so far that they suggested that they would institutionalize him.
"My first answer was," I didn't know that the people are still doing", explained Piccuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit nor sit or crabble until his third life year and he can't even speak.
But he makes slow progress.
He can walk with support and drive.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought about "Bite sing something before me."
"We bring him sign language with him," said Piciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language, she says, Edmund has created some signs alone.
Microcephalie has a variety of causes: genetics, such as Edmund, and infections with virus such as mass or zikavir during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognoses can strongly vary.
It is too early to tell how it will affect life of the cycavirus infected.
Piciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what's going on?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for a long time after the prognosis because I don't expect her to tell me something really.
But Piciuto has a hopeful advisory for mothers of heroes with birth damage caused by zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, overpowering offers availability to relief in Louisiana, Mississippi
Incredible rainfalls and large slows in Louisiana, the Gouverneur began to call the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated over the entire Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the south of Louisianas and the south of Mississippi crossed their woods and threatened large overflows to extreme rainfalls, reported the National Water Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards reported that state officers are in permanent contact with the local authorities and are already undergoing assistance to the communities concerned.
Mikeacassar, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation of the Gouverneur, shared the demands for highwater vehicles, boats and sand sacks.
August stated that only the Tangipao community had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A overwhelming warning system is used by several parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service was decreased that additional 3 to 5 rain tariffs could fall in this area.
On the south of Alabamas, a flight warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to be reinforced in the mobile area.
The river committee near Baton Rouges and the River Office near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will be reached after the weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could be overcome many houses near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stromabwart surrounding in Ascension Parish is a danger, since these are only slowly flying to the lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi State limit in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached about 09.00 the highest position that has ever been registered.
Reservation teams still offered people from the river water in the area of the office and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son, were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which normally stands away from his house, was strongly increased overnight.
He said he had warned him another son who lives near.
"We're waiting, and the water stripped and stripped in there," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife Hansford said she had never seen a such higher level of the river in the 48 years of her life.
Hansford said he and his family members would have all difficulties, and he would be the only one who can be swiming.
Hansford said that all three Nothelpers had saved in a large military LKW and had brought them to the next firewave, where they were brought to the freeday.
Krautmann said that the overflow was "speaked," since it continued to be serious rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported near Livingstone from Midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 dry rain.
Krautmann said that the ground was significantly completed by rainfalls since midnight.
The authorities acknowledged that serious rainfalls and road transits caused the salvation of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipaoa Parish and educational disorders in five school areas.
The CBS WWL reported that a guest order in Tangipaoa 200 was overwhelming houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both overcome.
The chief of the Commonwealth Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven householders that were filled with high water.
In the towns of office and Hammond, there were emergencies to hide the evacuateds.
"When the water starts back, they'll be able to return to their houses," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the Commonwealth of Tangipaoa, almost two twenty roads were closed because of the high waterstorm, and the sand swimming pool for the inhabitants hope to keep the water from their houses and business.
"The latest overcome we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city management.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Council said that it continued to rest at the golf coast.
According to his details, a household should be reported as overwhelmed on Thursday, but on Friday has not been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Speaking from balls", survives shoes in Philadelphia
The police shares that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week has been the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandfathers of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandma said that Brown suffered several shocks, including in the lens, skin, arm and bottle, but he was at a consciousness in his transportation to the hospital.
"He has made a lot, his little body was cut from balls," his grandmother Delors shared the sentence.
I can't just believe it.
The state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to take several operations.
The family of the boy shared the sender that he was expected to be cured again.
He should start the first class in a local basic school.
Brown was one of four people shooted in Germany.
Similarly, three men were shot: two in the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical state; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in a stability state.
The boy was shot on the front of a car together with the 29-year-old boy who is in a critical state, reports the Sender.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police just identified whether there could be one of the lost men of the murderers.
The investigator shared the CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross fire between several shoes.
Powers for steel shoes, which were followed to various storm weapons, overlooked the slaughter.
It seems that it has been clearly treated for a long fight.
On the street, on both sides of the journey, swallows.
Thus it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved," the police addressed Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area.
There were no prisons, and the police is currently reviewing reports according to the video of monitoring.
On Thursday, another six-year-old girl was taken into arm when she played before her house in the West Oak Lane residence.
She's getting back and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presented under the Women's Olympic team in the tour and for more than one reason.
First of all, I'm at every summer olympiade since 1984, and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tourners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie", which inspired for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this manity, the Aly Raisman, the Jews, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has improved the black and Spanish woman's presence at the pitch of this sport.
In the last four years, the number was a African American under the women‚Äôs tourners.
Last year, Simone and Gabby #1 and #2 were.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympic games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and jubeled America.
Now the world was in a position to witness the incredible performance of the world's three-fold master Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but delivered master gemasticroutine.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, theeroexuel Americanian, who won at a individual multi-food event for women.
Member Aly Raisman won Silber.
We experience the spots of this sport, but in this way we don't see the turk loads in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are all in the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the olympic team.
They're the "last five," because the next Olympic team will only have four tourners in the manner. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be a turn sport and towers in the main line in private tower arrangements that are maintained by parents, which are used for training, establishment, traveling, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their families). The list can continue.
The majority of these towers is in favourable places that can support the business.
The tourners receive all their training and this is a tear and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, has both trained their athletes since they started with the tour.
We have to allow the communities to make a more lower and easier touring training available by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I found my tour office for 20 years.
In my events, we have offered free and accessive tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international victories.
In September, we will expand after Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-qualitative tours that will gain the possibility of learning and benefit from these amazing olympic sports.
Turners develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination provides long-term benefits for health and educational success.
It is the inspiration of this manity that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tour and that's great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
It's so sweet time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real exhibition of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic Manity Gold, and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The Ministers hoped that they could end the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37.000 assistant doctors, who agreed at a choice, decreased him.
In July Hunt plans were enthusiasmed to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was invaded in a "Nemandsland" and that any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant physicians should receive a new treaty that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the work of an instant hour.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Commission for Assistant Aids last night, communicated with a report: "Assistance doctors have proposed a treaty as serious concerns, especially that it is raised by the current involvement crisis and will be dealt with to treat all the doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks that remain, until the first group of doctors falls under the new treaty, must be made progress and the time goes out.
In view of the efforts made by the BMA to solve conflicts through conversation, the Government has to participate in opposite wills and sometimes towards an exercising sweet.
The result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, decreasing the inclination and talking to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the physicians have clearly shown that they are willing to carry out further work camps.
The last strike at the end of April saw an injury of nearly 1,000 routine operations and 100,000 terms, as physicians and experts were included in order to give physicians to the strike posting chain covering.
The Ministers hoped that the fight on the amendments could be completed by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to make a better weekly delay for the 54.000 assistant physicians that will be subscribed to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, requested the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Occupation measures do not achieve any of the few, but they are already overwhelmed teams and services and prepare patients, employees and their families only concerns, emergency and interruption."
In the past two months we spoke to me to the Committee of Assistant Medicines and to the Ministry of Health, as well as other ministers, positively addressed the concerns regarding the predominantity and Whistleblowing.
The employees hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics, such as detection, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time, training courses, mutual recognition of the education plan, continuing training and sexual rewards in the medicine, were a sign of how serious workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were to meet agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The ¬£2-pro day medicine that can cause heart-infarctic risk
Thousands of heart-infarct patients will benefit from a ¬£2-day medication after recommended by the authorities to adopt this more people for a longer period.
Ticagrelor medication reduces the risk of repeated heart infections for persons with heart disease.
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart infarction, reduceing the risk of a slaughter case or another heart infarction.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people each year experience a heart infarction and a fourth of them experience another heart infarct or a slaughter accident.
heart infarcts and slagan accidents are caused by assemblies of fat materials in the arterian walls that form the shoes.
If the beerag interferes, it may cause a blood blood blood blood insected to heart and cause heart infarction.
If the blood nervous is dissolved, it can flee through the blood strom and hide the blood flow to the brain, which causes a slaughter.
People who have already a heart infarction have a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the market name of Brilica, reduces this risk by making it uncertainly to the education of blood nerves.
The leading project of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month receipt of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a double-day receipt of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In view of the availability of secondary prevention, four hundreds of people who have suffered a heart-infarction, another heart-infarction or a slaughter accident - often with extreme consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart infarction may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing any other heart infection and slaughter in people who already had a heart-infarction.
With a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to extend available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor, especially the blood risk, is limited to a period of up to three years. The guideline project recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period.
Cultural of Political Correctness allows election fraud in muslim areas
The former Chief of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman has been removed last year on a government report because of corruption from the office.
A culture of the Political Correctness has resulted in the knowledge of wide election fraud in muslim communities as a destructive government report today.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles greeves the police, election observers and Council chambers to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse because of "exceptivenesses relating to Ethia and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now a king of corruption, said that the threat of elections from religious reasons would be so terrible that the police should be allowed to set out disabled countries outside election cabines to protect protect protect protected elections.
It recommends that the electioners should lead to a reference to proof their identity in choices.
At the time, a choiceer must just call his name and address.
The report proposes that not removed dents to the finger of a person if they leave their votes to prevent someone to choose two times.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for more access to common documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against elections, but also to protect the common government before the broader corruption and financial drug culture which is income," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's Election Canal in East London.
Last year, a special vote decided that the official Master Lutfur Rahman should be deleted after a Lithuania to corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a zynical way," and that his critics had been shocked with racism and Islamic admissions.
Rahman intended to "her campaign has led on the basis that it is the reliable obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Before 300 votes, they were doubtless or the consequences of a posture, where a person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said it was evidence of fraud in the whole country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming opinion for the preferential letter election - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate to their choice.
Sir Eric, trained, made several recommendations to cut the selection system, including the leadership of instructions to prove identity
The report states: "On the evidence has been made that the pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, to choose, in accordance with the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistanian or bandladesh background.
"It was worried that... public institutions would have ignored such a behavior because of "politically corrected" overwhelmings regarding Ethia and religion."
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to switch the system, including the prohibition of editing political active letters to stop "Women".
The report taken into consideration by Theresa May also requires worse registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social drugs.
Options consider to ask the choice before your choice.
Use not removed tits on the finger of a person when she left her voice to prevent someone choose two times.
Systemal reviews on nationality of a person to ensure that they are right.
A three-year limitation of applications to an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists edit full letter choices and advertisements of letters.
The police gives the power to establish restrictions for election stations.
An amendment of law which facilitates a complaint for threats under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volks-Representation Act 1983).
Photographer ban in selection stations.
Require that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees apply the rules that the electioners only go into the selection box.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan police and finds it "surprising," that after the Tower Hamlet's case, he wasn't sentenced.
"The election court declared Lutfur Rahman and his representatives because of a Lithuania of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
It has been known due to a number of reasons for sufficientness - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings -.
It also criticizes the disadvantaged "abuse controls" of the Council's Registration Divisions.
Sir Eric said, "The court court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, is a proud heritage, but the careful and disclosed expansion of election fraud and leakage of some authorities threatens this good call.

Viewers responded fast online after they were shocked from the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Has the CBC commenter just said that the 14-year-old swimming swimming from China "Where is a skin died?"?
The idiot has not captured that they were still on sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the end of 4 x 200m free swimming stahl for women: "This small 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not turn back when they heard how our usual Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angekel.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who modernized the CBC sending, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We forgive us that the comment was extracted over a slight performance."
It was a unfortunately chosen formulation, it's sorry that it happened."
CBC regretted about 90 times in the people who responded to Twitter's comment.
The commenter College Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apologize with more than 90 other Twitter users that were dealing with MacDonald's comments
The network also decreed quickly and gave a message out.
We regret that these sentences have been made and that it has been allowed to be excluded.
Last night, we were soon apologizing with our observers on sending and followers in social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimming pool and not to them as a person.
However, they were inadequate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald regreted himself in the sending and tried to justify his comment by he recommending that it was not his hope that it would be issued as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize a moment for the comment I made after the CBC Olympic Exhibition, he said, "I would like to apologize for the comment."
"I'm on the performance of the snake and not on them as a person."
Of course, it wasn't inquired and I'm very sorry."

All products in question were taken out of the sale.
How to protect Krav Maga against arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him something more secure for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to run with armed buildings closely removed.
Independence on whether you can draw close to you from front or down, this video will show you how you turn the sword for your skin.
If you're close to you from down, then you should turn around as first, so you can see your adversary and "she give you out of the shooting line", Mizrachi says.
Then take the weapons between your frontarm and your slaughter before you shoot him with your free elbog face.
Shut him up with the skin into the shoes and turn back, while the smell swimming up for pain, the weapons out of his hands. Shut him into the face and move back while they put the weapons on him.
The technology is similar to infringements that are closer to the front - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapons and turn it up, so that the shooter can't shoot it.
Reduce the weight on the weapons and shoot the weapon on the breast, then turn the weapons out of his griff before they move back and put the weapons on it.
Klingt hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is.
But think that it's the safeest to overcome your money - if you don't be Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveller Ian Wright slows his language to the most comfortable places of Europe for a traveller
A British traveller understood his immune system and flexibility of a serious test by cutting some of the most sweet and exquisite places of Europe.
The moderator and traveller Ian Wright, 51 Suffolk from Suffolk took his trains on a euro, a country at the Piccadilly Circus, a wheel button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.
Before turning all objects, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going on.
But the experience, which was drawn under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results on daylight.
The gratitude to switch the smuggle button, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally distracted, but indeed there are more bacteria in a kitchen shop.
At his travel through Europe, Mr Wright said with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of darbages and his own health.
Unfortunately, nothing left that he turned away, more than a bad shock in the mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his darkness by he traveling through the world and eating uniquely and wonderful things.
From public lands to rail floors of toilets, the task of its immune system was definitively under a test
In the film he said, "I was pregnant for me as a child, and I had cut all the possible things in my mouth, earth, wolf and water."
In the film, he was just asking for every case.
The only thing he rejected was a smooth public toilet in Russia.
His trial showed a number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop, after their luminometer number over 4000 units, while fresh hands show one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places than the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I smokeed in a toilet, nearly."
There's nothing more funny than that!
I'm not going to do anything here, because it's pretty in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company allows Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of dark batteries and immune systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Categories Niko Kaurenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time declares the advantages of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brain turmings that ended that we said, "Let call us Ian."
They said that the interest in dark health will be a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of dark health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in soil health is a global phenomenon and with the documental film, we could provide the consumers more information in a interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film region, added: "Let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had chosen some of the things I had told him to shoot, as the exquisite Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian, to put them up, and others, where this was very difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these smiling leckers on the film."
In a 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of all demanded milk acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of magn and darm and 58 per cent, said that they use at least available products containing milk acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left their home after a description with a damage of 500,000 ¬£, because they terrorised their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were captured after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked households found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls shocked on the walls, wooded woods were shocked, the mould was discovered on the foot ground and the graphite was shocked on the walls.
The families were turned up and it will be accepted that they live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was not reparing.
She said, "It was a absolute living room for people here, and I am thinking that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account, since this existence probably will be viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family's behavioured, and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived interimly in the apartment and the police said that the terrorism that the family had added was struggling streets with baseball slaughterers, shocks of habitants, drug abuse, drug traffic and excessive crys, riders and flows.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the Meeting Treaty, was ordered for anti-social behavior in June.
In some places of the house that is deleted under circumstances, old mull was found
There was a place in which the drugs were treated in the past, the woods were disrupted.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing described her and her partner this week by the presence, after she gave them a extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntary.
The description was triggered by easy neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "He was shocking for no one."
We lived 20 years next to them, and it was always bad.
The incredible cases we're telling the police here are incredibly.
"We couldn't sleep tomorrow."
We stopped because it was so calm here - that's not we live!
Now where they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have cooperated with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house in which the police was called in regular distances for 20 years
On the overwhelming side of the community house, milk and old game tools were understood
He added: "It's a shame that the midder summoned, any responsibility for her behaviour and its family to accept, as a description is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing is taking into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour of the conduct was extreme and their acts were terrible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community who have been courageously attended to us and have allowed us the information.
I hope that this development will make some neighbouring comfort and that the message is not tolerated by anti-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A smooth matrix that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Employees of the house management will now have to displace M√ºllbergs to run the house
2014 the police passed a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis, and wagen, paraphernalians and bargeld higher than ¬£1.700.
Skeldon received a currency sentence after her ownership of a drug of class B in trade.
She stated that the money for a Grabstone is Lee Skeldon of her son, who came to life in 2013 at a car accident.
After they were without obdach, Tanya and her partner are out of their lives in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were shocked with Graffiti.
The police says that it will be delayed by Members who do not hold up the budget regulation.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall reported that the delocation is a clear warning to the other members who are not at the budget.
"This is about those who think that they can be taken without self-defense, as well as to those who have been damaged by such a conduct," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviors that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.

This was the moment in which the decreased tourists started to be born in panic after a deep jet cut down over a full beach.
Dramatic video records showed how the military flight aircraft was almost slowly close to the sun providers on the Strategy part of Aero in the Northern Portugal.
The vacants are shocking when they are understood to make concerns about the swimming works, without first seeing what happened by the swimming clouds to them.

Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacants who posted the videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "It was very deeply slow and there was a moment as it seemed as it would shoot it."

Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were moved to Panik when the aircraft came from the darkness and incredibly flew deeply
The Portuguese airlines today found that the pilot of P-3C Orion aircraft was on a train flight to identify fisherboats before the coast and so deeply flighted that this was the only possibility to identify them.
The speaker said that the Jet was more deep than normally, however, that the airway forces were threatened to security at no time.
Area burdens have destroyed the portugu√™s Festland parts of this summer year, with four people on the island of Madeira.

Furthermore, Goalie Marc-And is lacking in stages.
In the training, the Germans experience a landmark in the kit, which has been declared at least for the first time for Claudio Bravo.
The Chile International and Ter Stages in Barcelona has been one of the states for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique rejected a clear decision in this regard until now and left Bravo in the Liga, but so the most other claims were the presentation.
Before the first game of the new game time, the Spanish Master doubts about the fatness state of the manity was suspicious on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Also, in Probegalopp 3:2, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced that Lionel Mesi and Co. were not convinced.

Ma Long in a own link to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tischtennis Olympioner.
The 27-year-old day at Rio de Janeiro was a single final of his countryman and "Tititel defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4).
In this way, the World Landlist Priests made the "Golden Grand Slam" successful success at WM, Worldcup, World Tour Financialists and also Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chineses have done it as expected in the end game and made the title one another.
This was clear that, for the third time, a Chinese would take the individual title in the sign of the fifth line.
The last non-Chine on the top of the Olympic Trip was the former SVS-N√É-Legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the rates and at time-outs they had no coachs with themselves.
They had turned back to the tribunes and left their shooters in the right coastal fight alone.
"I have played the matchs until here for my country."
"I'm the Finale I'm playing for me," Zhang had sincerely said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners were placed with the Chinese farm.
The match itself was unexpectedly unexpected.
But his 28-year-old enemy had to fight only in the first word.
Then he specificated the time on the plate and left the Zhang from there only 13 points.
With the overwhelming of Ma, the expected match was not developed.
Nevertheless, there was no reason to see enough ball change.
Mizutani wins the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsow 4:1.
In his fourth final, the whiteruses had brought up a ripped injury against the German Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and then had been in medical treatment, and he had to "last" to be met with blonde.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and J√∂rgen Persson (42/2008) have also become similarly higher tissue plants of Olympia.
Donald Trump is able to engage in the election campaign
The leadership of the United States Republicans is put on a majority by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now gave the weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republic of Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which multimillionarys who were normally largely safe and self-sufficient expressed something like the concerns reported by the correspondants.
After he took 16 rivals within the own Republican loggers, the doubts of his success in struggle for the white house.
"We have great problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who asked him for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If there were wrong reports about his candidature, he re-examined his well-known media school.
Watching the Republic of Hochburg
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A SurveyUSA survey from June was the Trump and his competitor from the Democratics, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see the trumpet before, however, not with the distance used for public candidates in the State.
Arizona and Georgia are also dangerous.
In an interview of the Sender CNBC, Trump answered the question, as he wanted to stop the Premarginal Clintons: "Genause, how I did it until now."
And go back: "It's going to be successful, or I'll make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He does nothing else than "to tell the truth."
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it would be okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll come back to a very good way of life.
According to the press reports, the party would have threatened Trump to strike money to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of that, the candidates of the Republicns would like to be stronger among the arms.
Olympia: Three fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a discipline committee in the case.
Kenias Lechtathleten threatens the second Doping job at the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro Ungeach.
After a fraud survey at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee shared a discipline committee in order to investigate the case.
A Kenian official reported that the former speech and today's coach, John Anzrah, had issued an Urin test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-four Ferguson Rotich.
This is reported by the Kenias team by the Doping Controls.
The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC information on the case to undertake its own investigations, shared a IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC will be assessed by the IAAF," said in an IAAF statement.
"Er (Anzrah) went to the Doping Conpulsion Station and was deleted as Ferguson Rotich, issued and signed the test," Kenia Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in the possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was grown in 2015 in Peking WM-V√§teer over 800 meters.
Four days ago, the Kenyan Lightthletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was taken from the Rio games.
He should have informed against money payers of his country about existing doping tests.
According to media reports, it should be arrested when returning to the airport of Niirobi.
Kenia has been under special observance in the IOC after numerous Doping procedures for many years.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Doping target controls provided by the IOC, it was uncommonly indicated that special athletes from Kenia and Russia were taken into view.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had performed a lot of pressures on the African country to create an anti-doping site and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia begins.
As a result, WADA Kenia was taken from the list of countries whose Doping fighting is in compliance with WADA rules.
Kenia's applies to the great shipping nation.
The slight thresholds of the country won at the WM 2015 in Peking most of the medailles.
In a number of RRD television reports, it has always been suggested that there is easy access to Kenia Doping in Kenia and that it should be a significant mentality of sports.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had appointed them in the Russian lightlighting.
It could be demonstrated that this sports type has been slowly and systematically baptized.
Russia's slightthroughs were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side History" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare-year the Salzburger shows the "West Side History" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love, like Romeo and Julia.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical heritage of Salzburg: the "West Side History", Leornard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistist leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to put the musical temple in the classic temple and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchester grain, the Simon Bolivar Orchester under the leadership of the Venezonal Dirants Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of Rhythmus," he warms.
We always say that it's very late-American.
There are many Latin American additives in their time and melodie.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect reception for our orchester.
I would say we're really in our blood in Bernstein's music!
In this incense Bartoli plays a older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the young Maria plays and dance.
The role of Mary has always beat me.
First of all, because it's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her sing: "I feel beautiful, oh so beautiful, I feel nice and sweet."
So she is ridicule, of course also naive, and very painful.
"He looks like me, my Italian character that I have as a Roman," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of the praise for the Oper song: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's so honour to work with her.
She's an unforgettable man.
And Bartoli returns the complex: "Double is such an extraordinary artist and very painful!"
Direction is a need for him.
It looks like it's his life in every movement, in his eyes!
It's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a higher southern temperature, a fire, a suffering, and also a joyful approach to life, which is really very important!
For the American government Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side History" is currently highlighted: "In this part it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today, we have the refugees, then the Porto Ricanes went to New York, and the New York people didn't want them.
It's the same topics, and they're exactly as at the time today.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
Londra's school girls, who joined the IS, were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls left London last year to connect the IS, died reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Kunjee said that her family had experienced her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was confused that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the Bolletwork of the Group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and murdered after her family was planned to leave the warfare and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only good is there - as a record and warning to others that these are the risks that are linked to go into a war area - people to take this decision ever," said Konjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London entered into a airport direction to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian borders.
Sultanas family was reported that she married a ISIS fighter in Syria, and became widow within less than months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a election seat at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democratics in the Senate, is convinced that the Presidency Chairman of Democratics, Hillary Clinton, will be appointed the Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicns in the Senate have confirmed Garlands since his appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senate Mitch McConnell is the view that the next President will be appointed the follower of the murdered judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected to choose "with a certain measure of consciousness" by Clinton.
A speaker of Reid later said he wouldn't even talk to Clinton whether they would name Garland and speculate.
He loving Garland and said that the Clinton's team would not care for disregard with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the United States Appletation Court for the Columbia District.
Raid said, the Republicns blocked the Garlands' Nomination, as Lakaien and helpers of the Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump.
He also determined that Donald Trump was inadequate for the President.
Treats wants Nackt Calendar for "Women and men"
The Treats Magazine works together with the photograph David Belmerre to deliver Pirelli-Inspirit Calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous Nackta people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum Calendar for 2017.
The director of Treats Steve Shaw told us to begin this year that his nacktmagazine was different from Oldschool Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
It seems to be that it's the calendar.
"We need to return back to show timeless and classical nakness, where both women and men are well feeling and feel inspired by these images of a woman's body," said Shaw in a press communication to the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a beautiful art work.
Models can present their images online or personal when open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkish: Curdial community calculated with mass flight
"Whoever does not adjust and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coffees," said the President of the Gullen-Cheen Foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Curdial Community has shortly calculated with ten thousand protection visitors flying from Turkey to Germany.
Medium-term it could even become "one hundred thousand", believed by the President of the Association Ali Toprak.
In view of the heartful action of the President of Turkey Recep Tayip Erdogan after the Putschweek, the Korean community expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term I contact with tens of thousands, medium-term with hundreds of thousands of protective visitors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association President Ali Toprak of the World of Friday.
Since the government has overlooked the Curdian Hochburg with punishments for months ago, 500,000 curves within Turkey were flying.
After the digest, they do not have secular and opposite ethnic towers.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are continued to be stressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a State that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association declared the targeted seat of Syrian Arabs in the Curdic but also in alevitic cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining rates.
"There are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Army and Greek were already destroyed or destroyed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The Head of the Association requested that the Federal Government "speaked as Austria against Erdogan and its members".
In Germany there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in the last months for the first time in Germany.
The German branch of the Gelen movement also fears the refugee of many towers in the foreign.
More Turks are searching for asylum in Germany, especially cords and oppositions.
The brandmarking as gluen attachors destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coppers, otherwise the chemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gulen Foundation Dialogue and Education, "the World."
As the newspaper reported on numbers of the Federal Ministry, Turkeys already put the largest group of asylum authors for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
On Thursday 30 June, this was 11.386 people and therefore 29% of all who were asylum rights acknowledged (39.625).
In this encouraging, the war, poverty or perspectiveness cannot be flewn.
Asylum, in accordance with the basic law, is only political, by state side, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg Powers: "It go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg pools: The homes do not receive anything from the summer wave fight with - and the holidays from Northwest Rhine cannot choose the landday.
They understood in Mecklenburg pools.
2021 the landmarks will not be taken directly at the end of the summer holidays, and the Schwarze Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more than ever, it's not: summer holidays, heating and landscape battles - that's going to be.
The locals to be convinced by the fighters are in vacation.
The most largest vacants in the country, on the way of using, swimming or hiddensee, are not inhabited, therefore they may not choose the landday.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers have the placeholders, split airballs, distribute fleeers, and finally spend vows, just swimming.
Up to September 4th, 2016, the election and last day, the Mecklenburg Championship has to be held by the people.
The warm phase, if you can say it, has just started.
And it's also about something: President Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/CDI coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It is shocking how strong Neuling AfD down and what remains at the end of coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, makes a nearly unexpected election campaign, looks out of its grand platkats.
He travels through the country, distributes Rosen and enjoys a little with the people, as it did his legendary preacher Harald Ringstorff.
On the other hand, Sealering has obtained cold feet and offers Kanzler Merkel the schuld on the fall of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We make it" has accelerated the increase in the legal populations, which will probably be expensive to him now.
The CDU with its spot-candidates, the Minister of Internal Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced as it is when you make it wrong at the right place of choice.
She has invited Kansler Angela Merkel two times to grandcomings; the centre of the Federal Days Cyril is located in the northern.
But the target group did not have to be true, there were more North Rhine-Westfalen, Berliners and Sachsen because it was not Mecklenburgers and Prepomers.
"It was probably the majority of other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently complained.
But there is also no damage to hear an Angela Merkel from other edges of Germany.
On the other hand, the Northern CDU is widely refusing to the ordinary election campaigns on market places and before sales centres with sun screens and airballs.
That means Kokert only plays a "subdesigned role".
In addition, the Union has noted that you are depressing the basis on the country that it has to be extremely endeavoured to find a channel towards people.
You're like the left, the SPD, the Green: there's no place in the west of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU fighter Kokert is also self-reaching: "They must go where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, goldene weddings, every birthday feast must be used."
Because many are on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a specially engaged campaign.
In surveys, social democracy was 22% behind the CDU (25) partners, just before the AfD (19).
In the election 2011, the SPD had still winned 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The green, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, would have to create the swimming day.
They make a modern attraction from the holiday note and make their selection camp largely in the Internet.
"Online Water Camp," he is Chairman Claudia Muller.
On the other hand, green choosing fighters are allowed to search for incoming urbans under the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the Spitzen Candidate, is just running with a house boat through the Mexileburg Sea and it is still nice.
Your impression: "The holiday in Mecklenburg is not punishment."
B27 Power: guests suffer under sperling
The speed with which B 27 is sanized, there's nothing to meat.
For the responsibilities of the construction work, which starts at 5:30 tomorrow and ends only before 20 hours, there are half lobs.
"They have done everything quite fascinated," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet channel.
It's a super team.
There is no interference.
The building was able to be planned towards the south at the start of the week, until October ends, everything should be done.
Promised will also be the income of the workers responsible for the construction, at least if it goes to the establishment of aid finances.
Since the building was changed on Monday to South, and the slope of the aspergstra√ües was also cut down in Ofterdings, and thus the connection to Rotenburg has also been re-established, the transportation site has been dispersed within the place.
The citizens can now re-interrupt from offences from B 27.
It seems to be retreated.
"There was partly significant complaints", says the principal chief officer Florian King, responsible for the transport technology management of sanctions.
The inhabitants of bags, stone stoneways, ports and Weiherrain had to fight with more airlines, because they were searching for many swimming roads and confidenced in their Navis more than the slaughter.
What caused some of the Lkw in residence areas.
Since the speed limits were not maintained, the Community requested the measuring vehicle to increase.
"There were significant overwhelmings," says King, who once conscious of the situation.
There's been two to three per minute.
The fastest was about 77 hours per hour in the time-30-zone.
Since the building has continued, however, if it becomes quiet.
For business work at B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open for customers from Rotenburg.
In the cards it doesn't like to look for business.
But that the B 27 representation has led to overwhelming injuries with them, everyone that you're asking can see.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "find", so produce for other companies, have little consequences for the sanction.
In the house of Mayer, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest decline", but it also claims that "the lack of driving."
The most strongest places are along the street.
J. Albert G√∂hner, Head of the Steakhouse, Krone forms, finds clear words.
This is already threatening.
Not just him, but all the guest towns have hit it "hart".
The customers missed from heatings, balings and rottweil.
We must be glad about every euro relocation.
The income is "more than 50 percent".
The road sanction has been "returned for two years".
The half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would be left, the policy would be differently reacted.
Instead, President J√∂rg Schmidt has asked for defense, whether it could give a financial compensation with the indication that the guests will benefit otherwise from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now they should also take the parts that are given by sanctions.
He knows from other land crystals where some of them were handled more widespread.
In all boxes, the gods are sure that his guests will continue.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
That other stakeholders now are less frequently previewed because of the complex transport management, it can understand.
If you can't come out, it's also nice.
In order to return after the end of the sanction works his stake clients, gods have no doubt.
In spite of the crisis with BSE and birdsgrippe, gods have the impact of B 27-bau work on its customership for the greatest crisis that has experienced his guests in their long-year history.
Six months of construction, it's already brutal.
Forever, in the name of terrorism combating laws is disrupted.
Following the recent proposals, the Minister of Industrial Maizi√®re presents a slight security package.
But what's a duplication status to do with terrorism?
And what's the coalition partner say to all of that?
Thomas de Maizi√®re gives the prosecutor.
All its proposals are "politically useful" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package.
They're not demanding anybody.
Other, continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
However, as the Minister of Internal Affairs, he is located on results and on a "reasonable consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizi√®re has left some time after the recent consultations in Wurzburg and Ansbach before he presented its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But these are now more extensive.
Some are already known, proclaimed, assigned: that a new security authority should take care of the skin encrypted communication is not new.
It is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU proposals on flight data and arms law.
The call after more video oversight and staff for security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, the Maizi√®re starts a second start of proposals that were not to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and to punish the Dual State Citizenship with the German Pass.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man enters.
However, it was worthy, and also demanding nothing to do with coalition partners without any opportunity.
A few new ideas are also presented by the Maizi√®re.
They are partly in themselves: he plants rapid procedures for admissions and more opportunities to arrest people before the departure.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should before check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of deductions for rejected asylum applicants, he wants to make some more worse than for a long time - some of those who do crimes or who are conscious of their papers in order to swear their identity.
Some of them are political and legally heavy.
Some are still insufficient and letting questions open.
And in some points, for example, in the inequitable treatment of patients, the question is: what does this actually do with security and terrorism?
Yes, the Majester says, it's important to differ between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it couldn't be disappointed that the murderers of Ansbach and Wurzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people faced high refugee concerns for security.
And things that the people were deeply employed now do not have to declare themselves at the time of election.
The internal security is shocked into the focus.
First the advice in the neighborhood: Paris, Kopenhagen, Brussels, Nizza.
Then the attacks in W√ºrzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are choices.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly engaged in internal security.
In the last days, there was high among the two parties.
First, a warm fight on the expense of the Federal Police, then on a assembly of security policy ideas of certain ministers of the Union, where the Heads of Residents also call for a Burka ban and an abrogation of the double state citizenship.
The Majesty also wants to be here for deceasing tones.
He wasn't thinking of a double pass.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
You're gonna stop, don't be sensitive.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is at all sides of constitutional feast and whether it is really "supportable" for the coalition partner, it must be still shown.
It takes some in what could be careful for the war.
However, the SPD also is currently trying to profile internal security on the subject.
Participant Sigmar Gabriel just reports carefully a conversation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved to continue to increase security."
People's car is still slow.
Despite such chandals, the expense numbers are increased in the world.
But it does not run around in all markets.
In the back-up action, there is a meaning.
People's car starts in the second half year of delivery.
In the past year, the largest automotives of Europe can continue to present a further extent, despite the slaughterers, thanks to its many brands and some good markets.
However, in July, the Kernmarks VW slowed mainly in Western Europe and deceived the total sale, as notified in Dax.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold in July with 449100 cars 1,8% less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China, the twicely market, the sales were 14% under the previous month.
In the home market, the supplies were almost a seventh set up in Germany.
Market Trade Chief J√ºrgen Stackmann brought the weakest numbers from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe.
Furthermore, in some key markets, it has undertaken a purchase in the "changed economic framework" market.
In addition to the situation in Turkey, the British vote on departure from the EU also explained a speaker.
In the United States, where the exhibitors are first excalled, there is also a minute to Buche.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main housemarks of the Niedersachsen are involved without the chandal: After the first seven months, only a decrease of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles to Buche is available.
Concern sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to submit a sales rate from January to July.
1,3 per cent of more vehicles delivered people from this time, 5.904 million in the world.
Volkswagen managed with a software degas test.
Only in Germany VW calls about 2,5 million cars to rebuild in the workplaces.
In the way of the rearing, VW confirmed that the rebuilding of the cars has no negative impact.
After the rebuilding of the vehicles, there is no deterioration for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor service.
The auto-builder describes a "garantie equal" certificate after the rebuilding of the customers, but not speak of a "garantie", as it was called on Friday in business crops.
The reasons are legal fees.
The "Focus" had reported that the Volkswagen guarantees his German customers now a guarantee for swimming cell models.
This had been confirmed last Monday by VW Deputy in the Federal Transport Ministry.
The Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was a meeting.
"WF has to completely comply with the installations of my Commission and the BAB."
"The derogations are not accepted", said the Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) under the Ministry.
The VW has agreed that the consumption of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor service does not have a deterioration and all type-approval vehicle values have unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "Garantie" but not how it was called in business crops.
In the widespread term "Garantie" the people's car is the possibility that customers, for example, come to a half year after the installation of a motor chain - and that could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.
It is also important to avoid that any other damages that have nothing to do with the disappearing channel are insured in respect of possible assurance schemes, as it was said.
Therefore the term "Garantie" does not declare VW.
The Raifeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rigorous sparors in the future - as the second institution in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on Giro or daily payments accounts."
The German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal: normal spaers should "no fear of paying for their sparrow punishment."
If banks pay money by night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay for 0.4 per cent of the penalty.
This expenditure requires the Gmund Railfeisen Bank to return from September from private and enterprises for funds over 100,000 euros on payment accounts of Giro or daily.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He stood 40 million euros from a day to the other and could not be evaluated.
"These are with me on the Central Bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of the costs", said the bank head.
"I can't add $4,000 for each million."
The costs are now continued in accordance with the principle of insurance.
The bargeld simply leaves the rail bank's treasure would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth," said the Bank's standing.
Most customers had understood and changed to other installations.
Only few turned to other banks.
Bayern's Society Association stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks."
They are alone "indefinitely impossible to operate."
Consequently, some German banks increased their costs for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
The Trinityer Peoples and Raffiisen Bank Altenburger Land had with its Skatbank filial 2014, with penalties for installations from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said, "We don't expect privacy to pay for funds so much, the competition in Germany under banks and Spain casses is too strong."
A banker said that the Tegernsee gives it "a customer that has been equipped with the property something more slower."
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if they find free money.
The 1911-based Communities Bank Gmund has furniture in Bad Wiessee, Rottach egers, Creuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, famous players, sportors and entrepreneurs are known.
The Bayern Communities Association "before there are no further banks that calculate a loan for private installations", said the speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Railfeisen Banks (BVR), Your Fr√∂hlich, had declared the end of June: "The wealth to go to the negative towards the privacy is very high."
Competitiveness is hard, and it threatens the immigration of employees to competitiveness.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to delay it in the width.
Destination plates: Who actually buys shoes plates?
One man in a mid-year-old age loves plates.
Before you earn the commentary to overcome it under the Pseudonym NonAlleAinmenorsMethoduals with sweet sweets, this statement depends on the current data.
According to YouGov, the many spoken resurrection of skin plates is not to a tree in Millennial that wants to welcome the news of physical objects but to return to the Midlife Nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are all the perspectives of age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.
It is also not horns through hobby samsing - it has a emotional importance: older plate buyers keep their feelings better for themselves (56 % s. 53 %) and enjoys delivering only time (69 % vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me, while I walk in a busy street in Soho, spend a slightly grey shock and switch up before I stayed, holding my hands and telling us something decisive, like: "But, let us take a closer look at us."
So let us look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly enters its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one of the independent salers was able to be able to purchase, there is a handly fantastic platform special business.
I would probably ask the cameraman to remove the camera for the next part, in which I stand directly close to different men in such business and try to evaluate her age and beauty by observing.
Steart from Glasgow, 55 whom I am by Sister Ray (Datean number: two young women, three men ages) in the Reckless Records (data number: eight men age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and walks through business to fill the few hours.
He's a Sammler, can I ask?
"I think it's right," he says.
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These ball plates above (he sent me the shooting shop by email, I'm not following him home), clothes out the walls of his living rooms.
The reason why he has such a huge number of albens and Singles is the result of his available income: he is now in the ability to buy places that he couldn't sell when he appeared and acquire again items that he sold when he was young and pleasant.
"My things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things that I probably was too young to buy me," he said.
It is true that those who purchase the plates are more introverted and like to spend only time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he is going to meet youGov profile.
However, he has also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media help, people who have heard the comeback and seeing themselves to buy their old plates again.
From the discussions I have conducted, people have normally completed their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who first sold their plates to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to get back their plates," he says.
This would explain the tree to adherents of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what is the emotional significance of plates?
It is only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to recognize that platform business offers a peaceful community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers were inclined to the uncontact payment system.
Some platforms feel overcome from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of trusted skin platforms, from objects that guard happily youths.
"I think sometimes it may be the full of a empty or the possession of material possessors as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's me as a Sammler, and I think it's like a lot of people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a employee from a plate.
A survey of the ICM in April understood that nearly 50% of the people who bought a plate have not been listening to them last month.
The survey also found that 41% have a plate player that they never used while 7% of those who buy a plate have no plate players.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blow through a stapel at Bossa New Compliments.
Johnny, 42 who works at Sounds of the universe (Datean number: three men average age) has noted a "trophene spectrum" of the Revival.
"Another one came in here recently and said, "I don't have a plate player, but I would like to buy a radiohead ball plate so I can put them in the regal," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have plate players."
These are young people, not older, who first entered slowly.
Fopp, who has almost a whole eye of the ball plates, has a good public when I go.
There are couples around the 70th, tourists, photos, adolescents and women age.
Even if the atmosphere is something less disappointed than in the previous businesses - the wild Beasts's new synthesizer and sex packing pop instead of experimental jazz drew from the sound speakers - it's good to see such diversity with customers.
Nobody else seems to be alone, but the native psychological traumat is difficult to determine if you are close to someone 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs in the business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the places to sell.
She makes a creature boom than a big invasion.
She does not pay much, so the collection of plates is not real option, she says.
It costs much.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or on another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she depends on a loved sweet.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stand is a business that will be said that a new generation of plates lovers has to inspire: Urban Outfitters.
While I looked like to need Jeans Hotpants, I observed a group of young teenagers who are grouping at a moment about polyroid cameras before a father and his daughter turned up to buy a Crosley plate player.
To the left there is a floor house, a full wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mixing of temporary music and classic skikers, the essential plates for a medium collection.
Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are just decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platten art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these objects means more money for the sector and some customers could send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to shut up.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than other, even those who are mostly experiencing for luxus materials such as plates.
Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are voted, they will not take into account at least in platte business in Soho, the large number of women's collectors and platform guests that exist in reality, platform business and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
You'll pass their Sunday with security with the booms through the Berwick Street's plates and the footages by plates, while they're mediting on the shooting view of an unclean, 30-year false moderator, who calls no men who have a medium-year age over the shoes.
The Gr√∂nland Hai is the most long-life workshop - video report
Scientists say that the Gr√∂nlandhai has the longest life level of all the workshops on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigated the Haie, says that the record was at a woman who was out of that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five feet long.
French Court refusal offers on absorption of businesses in the Dschungel refugee stock
A French court rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais, twenty-first provincial business and restaurants in the Dschungel of Calais, in the county of thousands of refugees.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to spend 72 provisional businesses in which persons in the loan, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to sell fresh services, or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or to sell for a few euros in provisor restaurants.
Calais prefectures argued that these places should be disrupted because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid taxes and mount a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important, since the free food time offered by the State supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also found that provisor businesses and restaurants would often offer a living room and free food time for people.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the instruction of people employing the 72 provisor business, but found that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely "complete".
Judge Jean-Fran√ßois Molla said that food business, coffees and restaurants would play a much greater role than only to feed people who live in extreme pre-conditions.
He said that the areas offer peaceful points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the Niederlands was the Jungle Book Kids' caf√© of the Lager, which will be employed commonly and offer 200 feettimes on the day, English and French class, as well as a advice for the hundreds of protective, uncomplied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the Petition to make the kid's coffee.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was called "for these children to be a catastrophy of whom the last eight years are."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of lives in the dschunger lived over 9.000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase of new congress during the summer.
Trotz Olympia Expedition: Martin remains struggle
Despite his angry event in the Olympic period, Radprofi Tony Martin will not be able to undermine.
"I keep the WM further in view, remain trusting and fighting," wrote the 31-year-old age on Thursday before his leave from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no statement for his miserable twelve place on the sugar hot.
"I think it's really hard to comment on the time from yesterday," said Martin.
He should analyze the reasons for the debacle.
At the newspaper WM in October in Katar, Martin actually wanted to fight the title.
"I'm going to see everything we've changed last time."
"It is also my position," the three-year-old World Meister, who had lost about 54.5 km at midnight more than three minutes on Olympiasier Fabian Cancellara (Sweden).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siege and passed halffinal

34) the half-final of the Olympic Tennistorians.
The healthy one, which was covered by backing problems, could only carry out their appeal once and effectively in comparison with the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr.2) was still able to spring in the final round.
The Australian open winner met on the British Britain Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis profile, Tommy Haas in Sydney had received a medaille (Silber) in Sydney.
Two German DTB stars in the fourth final of summer games had recently been given in 1992.
There was never a German Duo in an Olympic individual harbfinal.
Concerns increases when start-up for Live video transfers
Other people to look at video games, it is a remarkable - that wants to benefit Microsoft too.
The Technology Concern buys the start-up Beam that has specialized on this hobby.
How much money it runs for the transfer, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam went with his offer only in January and has already been more than 100,000 users.

Here the Enforcement Trailer comes
Germany's Raser must set up the next generation of speed heat: In different federal countries, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new blitz devices will be tested to carry out timers specially effectively.
The futurely effective enforcement trailer of the Vitronic Company of Vistronics can, for example, be used to emergency points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blitzer to maintain speed limits.
However, a permanent mobile construction may be too dangerous or emerging.
The Enforcement Trailer is antark: His battery holds five days in uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data are encrypted through a modem.
The laser measuring technique can also be examined by all vehicles through several samples simultaneously.
Variable speed limits and driving bans after hour, driving and vehicle classs can also be monitored.
In higher state, the manufacturer can be moved according to each car with an appendix.
In order to not simply cut it, he is deleted in the measuring industry, so that the routines in the shocked and otherwise disappeared outside shoes.
Furthermore, an integrated alarm device is intended to protect the blister before Vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer is tested according to the information of Vitronic in various federal countries and is also used in the meantime.
Foreign authorities also join the new technology: Youth in France has run 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces in the last year.
Britain takes silver in the 7th Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass Gold holt
The impressive performance of the British rugby at the 7th Rugby ended on Thursday at the end of the last garden in the form of Fijis, when they were struck in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deomor Stadium.
Fiji distributed a master class in handling, seat set, spins, line loops and strong strength to win gold - their first Olympic medals every color.
The swimming place was sweet by the unlikely comfort price of silver medailles - the United Kingdom fourd on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they slaughtered New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant cutting of the boks, 7-5 in half-final on the same day, could return to them at the end.
But independently, Fiji would have buried a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for the GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British medaille will have a gold medaille for his hair: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind.
Eight years ago she lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one lost her.
This sleep is hurt, but progress is surprising.
Fiji began wonderful and left the GB's attacks from the path.
It was feeling for the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to walk in bus. The World Series winners went up to 5-0, as Osea Colinisau looked at the edge.
With four minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right edge that he turned.
12-0 and GB did not take the ball.
A heavy ball of Mitchell stopped reaching a third gate of Man Leone Nakarawa, but Fiji has stopped only.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a toilet down in the right edge and was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reappointment and there was still a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo published further weak bands of the GB team and shooted up to the line to make a gate.
The shift took a 29-0 to the pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
That's too.
GB carried out basic changes to half-time and closed the Fijian laugh for the whole four minutes, which was good for the first half-time level, until Josua Tuisova continued after a brilliant interchangeplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton began a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left edge for a 36-7, but the game was lost for a long time to benefit from the South Sea Universe whose fans sang, smiling fingers and dancing on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire the player's approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the i-connexion with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfeiffer shocked the Fijis and GB kicked the morning in the races.
Before the day, Fiji Japan had seen in half-fills with 20-5, and South Africa sloped South Africa in a nice half-final mach from the red - British change of the difference.
Kyle Brown took the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton passed the line with a impressive footwork and reached a door among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, saved the win - and thus the silver medaille.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to ruderside
No emotiary gold will be given than in these games and it wants to call something.
From the first floor to the last, 220 hard hairs in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if only there were the pains that were cut on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was first found as they were to the second Olympiagold in the two without tax fellows, the first women in the history of the British sport, which took such a measuring table.
Their dominance was absolutely its 39th unclean use, which is also unprofit.
What we're seeing is two brilliant athletes that spend over the surface with the elegance of skins, which does not reflect the type of triumphis on snakes.
With each gold in the routine, a bathroom of wanting helpers contribute to the incredible progress that makes the difference and there was no helper than the trainer who didn't know if he would survive this day as it was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risking.
I had a bleeding cancer that could be operated and did it.
If you don't do it, he's wiped out all over there.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It's a little changed view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he had been treating the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what the interruption had been at a minimum time if this was in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better back.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and was on the station about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.
So it's starting.
The ruler is already a challenge, but it makes it even greater.
In the inmediate victory of the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nervous morning, used something to speak more than others and thus tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the principal man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an Afghan, said, "I was a emotional rake this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It's just repeating how much this means I, Helen and Robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have been, so we're going to thank him, and he's the best trainer of the world.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost rent in the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which they could not keep their enemy.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover were too much in reserve.
We've been arrested very much at the moment.
Helen called "Keep in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to let himself smile.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't going to make something good.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, get out and win the rain as we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before it takes decisions on his future.
Glover needs to appear on a wedding week next, his own with the TV advisor Steve Backshell.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that it was my last time.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it was about six months to understand that I was a Olympiagester.
It was so new for me and I was so stressed.
It's about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years old for clarity
The director of the Waterweck Group "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert G√∂ller, is in the peace.
The association applies as "bayer range".
A small fresh drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
Thus it was called in the originalton for a contribution to the Bayerian Rundfunk.
A week later, the Water Forum of the Government of Africans accepted the Joint Association.
The work of the veterinary stone group was "bayer widely".
All of that is Rupert G√∂ller, who was 31 years in the purpose of workers, has 28 years as a business leader.
Now, when he was 65 years old, he was adopted in calmity.
The drinking water association of the veterinary stone group with seats in cottendorf, the community of breadbruns, promotes about 150000 cubits of water each year and provides 32 places and weilers with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Memberships are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current President, Breitbruns Citizens-Minister Gertrud B√ºhl (FW), recalled that Rupert G√∂ller 1985 was set as water stock and was already appointed to the Head of the Goal Association in 1988.
The Chairman said: "Is tasks have been very multiplied and have been able to work on the waterbuilding and maintenance work on offices and organizations, budget planning, calculation of expenditure and contributions until weekends,‚Äù.
As an excellent event, she called the inclusion and involvement of the new burns (1994), basic purchases in the field of the new burns (1998) and the deterioration of farmers, the sanction of the High Reserveers (1999), the renewing of a central computer design (2004) and the part-time performance of water guidelines.
It hasn't provided a smooth condition and has always been re-newed because waters of life have proved and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she loving gods faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heartblue for his water-scale association and has regularly lived the water-scale association as it would be his own company.
A few weeks ago, however, he could introduce the concept of the Veterinary Steel Group on Nitrate Reducing before the water forum of the district of underground diseases.
For this, he has received a lot of recognition and loving.
Rupert G√∂ller, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water expectation and he's been a faithful button.
We were together a shooting team.
He called the raw construction and restructuring of the Association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use of this was, however, the raw burning on the upper holder at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at least 17 degrees, the whole night will be worked in order to enable the areas to be supplied with water.
The supply of new bruns has only been able to keep you up once because you filled the high conservator of Pett City with smokes.
The business management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stormer from Lauter, which reached the follow-up of Rupert G√∂ller.
The soprancist Anna Netrebko is open to the autism of her son, Tiago, and moves to other parents concerned: "You must have the courage to speak about it."
"The medicine has made great progress", said the 44-year-old age of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognised with her son, she believed that she should die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has been good before and now teaches privacy in New York, where it gives the best therapy.
"To give an example, if I ask him what returns two years when I sang to the mail country Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the most happy man on earth.
Tiago is connected to the basebarite Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relation state in Bargtenesse - Man shoots on life dangers
A 35-year-old man shooting on Friday at 10:45 in a multi-familiar house in Bargteitye (Kreis Stormarn) on his partner and died.
"The man has called himself with us and stated to shoot his life threat," said a police speaker.
The murder is on the fleet, after him is publicly banned.
It's a swimming range, because Sven S. could be on the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscle, bruned and has a flat.
The police has published a photo by him.
However, it's a few years old.
In this way, the man takes a sweet.
The man shouldn't be called directly.
He can still take the weapons with him, so the police.
Who sees Sven S. is calling the 110.
The police speaks of a relationship state.
The victim was a yearlong of 1988, the murder of 1981.
The competent police in L√ºbeck first did not want to make any information on the slaughter or the relationship between murderers and victims; but they confirmed that a person was killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We don't say now," said a police speaker in L√ºbeck.
As a result, a special income commando (SEK) was at the assault.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The German steel industry and crisis-intensive and energy intensiveness remains decreased from additional costs in millions.
Financial loads that threaten the sector from the ecostrom promotion are from the table.
It remained in the exemption of renewable energy environment in the stocks called the German steel industry, said the Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Western General Journal (WAZ, Freeday Expenditure).
"I'm really happy that we finally could reach it after two years of negotiations."
At first, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the hochof to generate electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the details of the German Branch Association.
Gabriel said the WAZ that it is now a principle union with the Commission of the EU in discussion with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
First, when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC environment of 20% is expected.
However, this will not be decreased in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the Provision of Electricity.
This is widely set out by the status Quo of the current rules.
Special importance is that Gabriel has successful efforts for the steel industry.
"In view of our campaign 'Star is the future', this is the first step."
"There are more skills to follow."
"All in the reform of emission rights, the climate and employment goals are to be decreased", explained IG Metall Chief J√∂rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel sector in Europe has been under overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
In the past year, the situation continued when the world's largest producers in China faced the weakened domestic demand of a massive steel on the world market.
European manufacturers propose Chinese steel convergences.
During this spring, the situation has been disappointed.
For a demonstrated import duties on import steel effects, the economic perspectives in China have been achieved.
It is not clear how sustained the price recovery is.
The German Branchen Primus Thyssen Group remained careful on Thyssen Group on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have been re-established.
The sector reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
The thyssen group also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers are careful despite increased prices and increased orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tons well six percent less raw steel than in the past month, as the economic association shared the steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now returned to the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, the production is two percent below the previous year value.
In the next months, the association is calculated by a improved term of contract with a increased decline.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singen keep senior good
The song has joined Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl was in the school, she taught the Music Fach at the school, and today the 78-year-old girls in a senior chor.
"Singen moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, pleasant and overall more living, she says.
Besides her health and spirit, she does something good.
Because Singen is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenga.
Most seniors sing in the chor and share the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
The regular collection of seniors can link and plant social contacts.
Because often solve social and family structures in age, a chor is an ideal opportunity to spend time with others.
This experience also has made the Ursel Kipp in their chor: "I'm going to talk and organize to leave and learn to each other - a chor is a very special form of meeting."
Singen can be positively encouraging, I mean Hackler.
Because the senior trains a deep and controlled breath.
Whoever regularly demands his lungs is not so fast every day from the bridge.
Even if it's going to get the voice in age, it's a optimal hobby.
A very special effect on older people often has the singen, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of Senior Organizations.
In the old generations, the common song had a higher value, it belonged to every day, both in the school and in the free time.
Lenz often observes that the songs or hearing of songs in older people are cutting many memorys, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
With song texts and especially melodies, themselves demended persons have a long-term reverse event.
The head is also requested for a special performance in singen, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on the own voice and a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other songs - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Almost older people who live alone are so that they are not only focused on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the acknowledgement that you're obtained by the song in the chor means Hackler.
An excited public is a great loving.
The feeling of self-value also increases through the song in the chor.
If I work for something, I'll be better and wake out of me - this experience strengthens.
Good reason to start with the song, there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby shouldn't smile - even if he means to have a little talent, Lenz.
You're not sing alone - 50 sing people, who's listening to it when a voice goes down?
In search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
When someone from the famous circle in a senior, you can simply connect.
Many cities also offer overviews about the Cuts in the area.
Whoever wants to sing in a church chor can directly go to the congregation or the chief of the church.
Many artists are also found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet may ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Whoever has lust to sing should unless a chor, he's sweet Hackler.
Sing the soul does good and has something free - it applies to every age.
Kats react sensible than cats on the cry of the youth
Biologists have studied in Hannover which effects have the call of Katzenbays on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meau also did not calm the male, but they were always equivalent to women.
Women's cats can recognise the degree of catzenbays at the mile of the small ones.
They react on 10 percent more faster on the laundry of kitchens that are in great emergence, such as scientists from the animal health school and the medical high school Hannover (MHH).
Caters also respond to the call of kitchens - however, it is always the same.
"Openly, the acoustical differences between the mie of less and strongly administered young men are not real or not", said the biological Wiebke Konerding by MHH.
It is a study statistical, published at this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the kitchen swimming cry was different with the urgency of their assistance.
Overall, nine adult cards and eight kitchens were observed from MHH's animal maintenance.
You were predicted for a call of small people taken from the box for three minutes and separated from Mother and Brothers.
On the other hand, they were faced with crystals of stronger cuts that were further higher.
The researchers keep their results despite the low-scale tests.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own practice, have reacted to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned back to the sound speaker when this call of the very sweet kitchen.
This capacity may be born or developed with the sex.
"A surprising was that the men have reacted", said the biology.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby-care.
In addition, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to sweetlings, even if they were mothers or not, reported the biological Marina Scheumann.
Podolski greefed with "Gaala" to Supercup
Hakan S√ºk√ºr is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a prison order was taken against the only football star Hakan S√ºk√ºr.
He is intended to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the swimming pocket, in Turkey again is a major football game.
Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul on the supercup in Konya is clearly the official line: "Business as usual".
Until the derogation in July, the Government noted that the day of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this is not for those suspected to listen to the movement of the preacher Fethullah G√ºlen, which is responsible for the slaughter.
This will not be done before the football.
Unlike the previous Starkicker Hakan S√ºk√ºr, the State Authority made a arrest order.
This will then be proposed to be a member of a terrorist group in the middle of the United States.
In short, it is to be an ambassador of the preaching worker Fethullah, responsible by the President of the State Recep Tayip Erdogan for the slaughter.
Although the exemption conditions for the first 90 days have been passed until October, it actually has no effect on the life of most Turkeys.
"Democracy Waches" on public places in the whole country has declared Erdogan on midnight to end.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into adherents and enemies of Erdogan.
Special fans of the workshop Besikta are not traditionally among the friends of the President.
What the green of Turkishs, but in view of dramatic experiences in the history, is the strict rejection of military pushes.
There are even the fans - unlike their hearts for Galatasaray or Besikta.
In Pokalshigger "Gaala" it will be particularly at Lukas Podolski.
His sportive value at the end of the season was evidenced: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-olds ended his first game time as the topscorer of its agreement.
In the end of the game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 sequence.
The "Fanatic" newspaper tried him: "He was the best on the place."
He closed the season in an excellent way and secured his manity the pokal.
Thanks "Poldi" the swimming season for the register found a deceased end.
After the pre-running C.o in the Champions League, the "L√∂wen" was also shocked early in Europe League.
In the super Lig, it was only to Rang six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"It's what we did and that's the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Beektas, the game year is better.
In particular, thanks Mario Gomez, who met with 26 seasons as a super-Lig-True King the base to the 14th Title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope to return to the 31-year-old.
In this way, the Gomez only had announced in the AC Florence treaty and in the Besiktas only after the slaughter, not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he must only say it," said the Kycker's board chief Fikret Orman.
However, this should be ready to reject around a third of its $7.5 million annual year-year summarized, but Orman clearly stated: "You can't pay his content in Florence."
Nevertheless, these athletes have medaillen cancers at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already broken two times because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio.
Other transferred lightathletic sinners can just laugh in this - they fight in Rio through medailles.
The Doping theme is determined as before the slaughter lines at the Olympic games in Rio.
The Russian maimer Julija Jephimowa, who had sent its starting rights shortly before the games, was evacuated and exploded when they started 100 meters of breast.
It was a scourrier scenario: with a laugh she was still stolen in the hall and had tried with her reception.
When he found that she wouldn't get gold, the public took out in a jubel tower.
But there are still many other sports, despite Doping past in the Olympic games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-olds belong to the most surrounded figures in the lightathletic.
He was already cut two times because of Dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bathroom runs the Olympicians of 2004 and the ex World Meister even more fast than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number of one of the world and applies to the largest challenger of Usein Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100,4x100-m-Jamaika): The second Olympiasiher and seven times the World Master of 2010 had to rest a six-month sphere after she was declared to take the pain of Oxycodon.
After an operation, she had strong dent pain, the 29-year-old boys defended.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatian): 2011, the Olympiasier of 2012, World Master of 2013 and European Master of 2010 to 2016 has been tested positively on the prohibited stimululans midst of methylexanamin.
Perkovic has received the scientific receipt and was discarded six months.
The four most wide bears in this year go to the account of the large gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): Peking Olympicist and twice as 400 m, 2010 was positively tested and 21 months were locked.
A means for penis increase has been responsible, Merritt declared.
In this year the 30-year is over 200 and 400 meters of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Whiterussland): Never one athlete has been known so many medailles at night.
Thus Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after his testosteron doping was identified.
The average 40-year-olds had also to be allocated to Olympia Silber 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone misuse.

During the 29 years of old World Meeting, there were indications on the adoption of an prohibited food supplement, the WADA spheres of the World-Anti Doping Agency falled out of mildness on July 13th.
Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian blessed - More dead
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Minister, Thomas Schn√∂ll, freeday few.
They've suffered snippets and treated in the hospital, but they've already been able to leave this again.
Her home trip planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian state citizens, first of all, are not clear.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to contact the local authorities, so slightly.
About 200 km south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin, first on Thursday, were explosed in two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and about 20 people were damaged, including Austrians, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
Once Friday, two pieces were higher, and the authorities were killed another person.
The bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in early.
In the detonation near the Badestrand Patong, popular with holidays, a taxi driver was damaged after police instructions.
In Surat Thani, on the south coast of the country, a further bomb that killed a city officer.
The spectrum has been in the air, according to the authorities, in a flower beet before the coastal police reverse.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon at the South Coast requested several injuries.
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.
"The bomb captures take the same document," said the Armee General Danai Crimethavee freeday fee before journalists.
"We're going out that it's a coordinated attack."
It's too early to express possible reasons - however, it's probably to handle the acts of muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern that is typical for the bombs of muslim separators in the south of the country.
However, the Thai police declared that the attacks were not related to Islamic resurrection or international terrorism.
"This is only local Sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said one speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs of enemy of the dominant military junction have been placed.
In the past few days, the authorities had received a secret indication on the predecessor action in the south of the country - however, they had not been informed of the exact time and place.
It's still unexpected what group behind the appeal.
The police advised its officials in the whole country to strengthen the security of important government buildings and aircrafts, trains, tourist attractions, restaurants and awards.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombs, but they are not usually against tourists.
In Hua Hin, a palace was used for years by King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current explosions of bombs, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that the Tayland security authorities immediately guide the instructions.
High security risk (security level 3) indicated for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and Environment.
After interferences between the security forces and the Muslim population camps, it is not necessary to travel in these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) was referred to to the rest of the country.
The requests held on Thursday and Friday few days after a revised referendum on a Constitution developed by the Military Council.
This is also the great impact of the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to switch chaos while the country is in a direction to stability, improve the economic situation and tourism.
The military runta, who had taken the power after the 2014 phase of blue distress, was very favorable to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
Nevertheless, the military has not been able to obtain the situation of muslim rebellious rebellion since years in the outer south of the country.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people were killed.
Only one year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in the attack of a popular Hindu grin - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the worst attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "identifiant movement" is in the visa of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After a number of country officers, the Constitutional Protectors in the Bound have also observed the group.
"We see the 'identified movement' points for complaints against the free democratic rule", said the Constitution Chief Hans-Georg Maachten of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants are dismissed extremistly from the Middle East.
That's why we also look at the movement.
The "identified movement" is a grouping with French roots, which is also active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of his own identity by transmission".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Th√ºringen - already observe the "identified persons".
He said that his authority had agreed closely with the country officers in the decision.
"Creates like the 'identified movement' try to take their target group where it is", said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
General tries extremists to speak with youth right language, often with poppier music.
The Islamics also killed legal extremists.
This is not a good advertising for your own thing.
The Propaganda has to address the people emotively.
Young people are in a special way attracted.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, it was given from several federal countries reports on "identified" contacts on AfD policies.
He said he didn't have any knowledge of it.
Constitutional protection contacts have only been relevant from a certain point.
It comes to the fact that each party - in this case, by certain people extremistly change their goal and become so extremist.
It is therefore clear that such persons have an impact on the parties.
This is not recognisable.
In view of the clear increase in legal motive crimes and attacks against asylum applicants and refugee events, Maasser said that he would not speak in this regard yet of the new right terrorism.
But we have found in the past years that it can give legal terrorist structures.
There was the 'Old School Society' group or the freetaler group.
It may be reasonable that further legal terrorist groups or small groups are planned against asylum demanders, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motivations.
However, a German or European control of law terrorism is not recognisable.
The previous groups were located at the regional level or in social networks.
It was concerned that many of the controversies were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scenes.
That's the worryful thing.
Many of the actual suspects in attacks on asylum events had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or actors of the right scenes.
"Those have therefore started crimes that had nothing before with legal extremists, which may have been politically indifferent, or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links, which, however, have raised themselves by an extremist stimling machine."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte will be on the internet
Not always determine the Olympics or World Records the slaughter lines at the Olympic games.
This shows the courageous event of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the lightly overwhelming swimming swimming from Ethiopia was so late that he was not to see in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - unlike the expense was chosen.
In the social networks, Habtes became viral internet stream.
In fact, the 24-year-old age ends with a decline of 48 seconds and engaged in the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was not just his sporting figure that moved to the attention of the international media.
Why, however, the 24-year-olds participate in the Olympic games?
The Ethioopians received a special starting law from the international Swing Association.
This will be distributed to make skins more known in sub-represented countries.
Since the majority of the sportors run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the great journey.
Quickly make the first piece names the round.
Some media called it "robel of the Wal".
The English boulevardblatt "The Sun" was sweet about him with "Pad Bod".
His time, he was just a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free style, did not play a role.
Compares with "Eric the Eel" were also taken.
At the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani was careful for mediaal attention.
Indefinitely, the swimming swimming from Equatorial-Guinea, when he had to occur in a time of over 100 meters of free style alone.
Frenetically Moussambani was shocked.
At that time, only eight months ago, the 22-year-old teenage learned to smile Olympia and had never completed such a distance before the coast.

According to the police, the 67-year-old routine had left her business on Monday 17.30 and forgot to close a window on the earthquake.
When they returned to 8.15 p.m. on the next morning, the Zirka castle lost 250 euros.
Unable to find out the murder.

Trump does not look close to the threatening elections.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump speaks on a election campaign meeting in Florida.
If it's nothing to be the president of the United States, Donald Trump has an alternative.
Then he's walking into the holidays.
If Donald Trump lost the US Presidency election in November, it would be relatively equivalent to him: "The last time I'm going to cut it or I've got a very beautiful, very long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US franchisman CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it's okay, Trump.
Thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of democratics Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic terrorism State (IS).
In the outside of his party, it was still more resistance.
Post increases in the trade with electronic transporters
An Electronic Training Vehicle of German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously great.
The post plants to sell their electric vehicles StreetScooter also.
In Korze, the concert wants to start the trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electronic transporters from the next year also on the free auto market.
"We want to increase in the sale to thirds," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether they should also sell to other operations of their own developed StreetScooter, with the letters and cups.
Post-president J√ºrgen Gerdes had said that it was always re-interviewed by handworkers.
Following the information of the News Machine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Concerns will involve in the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-fabrication plane, the company will build up from up to 10,000 cars per year and shock.
Gerdes had announced that the concerns would clearly increase its fleet of electric vehicles and spend a full switch on the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very robust step direction 2020", he said end of July.
I can imagine we're gonna get the full float.
The StreetScooter is active on German streets since 2014.
GfK Guide is decreased after detrimental business payments
The GfK Consumer Research company cut off his chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats were suddenly, but not very surprised.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK acknowledged that the steel of heads of Matthewhias Hartmann will be more insecure, as long as it was promised.
Turbulences at the point of the N√ºrnberger market research company GfK: After re-interrupting business numbers and the retreatment of the company management, the world number five of the sectors will be held before a personnel restart.
GfK's chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The President of the GfK Advisory Council, Arno Mahlert, is already divided into effect on 12 September from the Supervisory Board.
The leadership in the State was already overlooking the previous member Gerhard Houseruckinger in September, with the company.
He must officially take the function of a "president speaker" until a follower is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for retreats, the company called "divergent opinions" for long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to call a company speaker on Friday.
Who will lead to the market research company to be still unexpected.
On Friday, it was said that the shareholders had recently been depressed on the continued success of the restructuring covered over the years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been on the GfK split since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are still not seeing after five years," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK business payments, each shareholder will ever be disappointed.
"If that would be the case in BMW, it would also do the timets," said it.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after returns.
With 361.2 million euros, the transfer was up to 6.1 per cent under the level of the comparable pre-yearquarters.

In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK has produced a concert win of 19.7 million.
Accidentes - Bus swimming in snakes in Graben: 8 slaughtered
On a travel bus accident with 43 seniors as passengers, on Thursday, on Thursday in Krummmhorn (Landkreis Aurich) eight people are injured.
Two of the infringements suffered seriously, the police shared.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to exempte its information from an incoming laster that was carried out on the trail.
The bus came down right from the street and shocked into a snake, as a speaker of the Aurich/Whitmund police reported.
"On the basis of the bus situation, people couldn't leave the bus autonomy," she said.
The fires freed the insects.
Six relief cars and a notar tank came to an accident on the country Street 2.
The latest travelers were returned from a line bus to the crowd of the crowd of Pewsu.
There they should be waiting for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators requested the rail drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The costs per cubikmeter waste includes from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Newdorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3,44 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (of 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (of 2,18 euros).
The installation in Azendorf will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvements are needed.
After an overall calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubicmeter.
As Master Bernd Steinhouses (CSU) reported, the Board of Agricultural Council of Kulbach was determined that undertaking for these waste-water facilities was undertaken.
The Casendorf market has been obligation to operate expensively because of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016 the citizens and the shopping and industry companies of Wolchenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to be entered into the currency hotel.
The expenditure increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Head of Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the body, a new calculation of the expenditure for the market systems was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-related subdetections were compared from the previous calculation period.
The gravity burden increased smidt was found to ensure that all three waste plants were relatively small facilities with a very low water accident, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubicmeters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, the applications for necessary repairs of several thousands of euros would be seriously affected.
In addition, it is easy to swim in all three plants.
Furthermore, in the returning calculation period, all three plants have not recently occurred in a significant scale because of their age of sanctions and reparatory applications.
The facilities in Azendorf were nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Wolchenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt found that in the Azendorf installation, the mechanical relief plant was to be extracted because of a damage.
In the pumpwerk of Welhenkol, the nearly 20 years of age had to be removed and, at the smooth board, Lopp had to be evacuated after near 20 years of exploitation of the first cloud, swimming the cloud and establishing an additional relief opportunity to keep the water laws in the future.
Schmidt: "This extraordinary applications came to the continued care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The equivalent applies to electrical costs that are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steel households clearly made that in the low-water accident in the three plants the applications for the exploitation and maintenance were "complete".
In addition to the Smidt, the market community of large maintenance costs remained in the last 20 years.
The situation for the plants concerned will continue to be precarious to keep the stone households on a period of time, so that it is not possible to expand the area of the Water Training Association for these installations because it is a deficiency institution.
Bulgaria benefits the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (of June 2012) and the first over 0 since October last year, as a positive 0.2%.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0,8 %.
The consumer price index compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and compared to the annual inflation in July 2016 to July 2015 -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the month (1,7%); transport (1,8 %); free time and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); different goods and services (0,3 %).
The prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile equipment, budget equipment and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the month in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; accommodation, water, electricity, gas and other fuel; communication; and education.
Snapchat "animal effect" criticized as Asian carriage
Snapchat says that this filter is animized, but some observers say it is unsecual to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in a way that is already limited to absurd.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be a slight stone.
The filters are unfavoured, property rotating tools that generate more than 30 million increased selfies per day.
All failures have been achieved to publicity.
Snapchat filters have made themselves critical in the past, in which they were accused of propagering the App Blackface or white skin as a beauty side.
When this week some users predicted a filter that gave them slippers, false teeth and shooting angles, some critics called a racist carriage of Asians - "Gelb face".
They asked whether these repeated contrasts showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.
News and reputation were widely distributed at midnight, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it had disabled the feature.
The company gave an apologize: The filter was a hommage of anim-caracter and not as a carri√®re of Asians.
But foreigners who have experienced the racism, the filters reminded the filters of harming clergy.
Others decided the anime comparison.
In a email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Twitter was widely distributed that the filter was "trained and pleasant".
She added that "that is difficult to argue with the opposition of a very opposite Asian carriage and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not sweet, but that the face of the skin was taken into a slight extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes this cultural steel ratio.
The American culture seems to be confused in an unfinished diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in the hand.
And Snapchats, a large public of young people - who are in race matters more different than their older players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters creates a image that is political for a user, "It's much harder that such things remain unremarkable than previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu decided to remove its Snapchat account to others as a product manager and engineer for media.
In an appendix for media and telephone interview, she said she believes that racial contrasts reflect the lack of diversity in setting practices in Snaapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only men's leadership and finished their opposition with a Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Only, they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their skin, so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they are safe or like to say something."
Others share their views, a complaint that mostly left Snapchat in response.
The company does not issue numbers for the diversity of its involvement, and is on its status as private enterprises.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to a speaker, the company has recently established a personnel responsible that focused on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said to her that she will let her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."
Army Management False ISIS Secret Service Information, the Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed public information in order to describe a optimistic image of the war against the Sog Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual situations in place, reported a study committee of the Congress on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republic of the Force of the Force, the Secret Services Committee and the Committee of the Peacebudgetary, reports of great inadequacy under the Central Command of Secret Service Analysts, which reported how their assessments were made on the United States efforts in combating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarter in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Lakes.
"Information services, which were typically cut by higher Centcom commands, regularly marked a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual situations in place and were more positive than analysis of other news services", reported a newspaper article.
"What happened at the Centcom, it is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analysis are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, the Republican member of the Representative House.
The leadership errors in Centcom are available to the top of the organization.
The 10th report shows detailed concerns in the 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in training the Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct instructions for government spots under Obama's instructions to change the reports, analysts showed how to draw up a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, including known as ISIS or ISIL.
"After the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Communications, opinions and comments were significantly positive than it corresponds to the facts."
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military return of Moscou could already start in April or May 2015.
Mossula, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"In the months of investigation, it is so clear", said Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015, the Central Command spots changed the public service reports in order to submit the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicns called the Task Force in life after they were played that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday is still completed by more detailed expertise during the investigation.
Furthermore, the Centcom reports are investigated by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own recognition that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Task Force.
"In the 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the creation of ISIL and the Iraqi security services", said the highest democracy in the Committee, member of the Representative House Adam B. ship, in an opinion.
This process, as Mr. ship, "delayed the publication of public services reports", damaged the moral under analysts and "gab very little space for dismissing opinions".
But Mr. ship and the democrats gave no indication to have found the white house in the Centcom Analysts about a "determined political opinion".
The provisional results of the conference‚Äôs findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
In August last, the New York Times reported the investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, which were registered after complaints of Centcom Analysts.
Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the general Inspector are still in profit.
But he also acknowledged that "experts sometimes have different opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the defence minister welcome a controversial debate on this important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reacted to the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a holding that is made in this respect by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The accused of the last year, however, took the question of how President Obama can leave the Central Command on honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls over over ten years as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a copy of how the current government under George W. Bush made the recommendations of many analysts only predicted a small placement instrument in Iraq and a little time to think about the consequences of 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in opposing the current reporting on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr Hooker reported that the Government's statements against the waste of the Islamic state had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorism group, as these provisors had been employed in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms then command chamber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislatives because of its extremely positive assessment of the war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to the rest of April and was replaced by Gene Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in the field of women, a showdown with British
One day after she shot three towers over Japan during a 6-1 win, Katie Bam also made the first two towers for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans wined with 3-0.
Five Towers in two games should actually be a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember what they had ever done.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't listen to those who keep their doors in the memory.
However, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Competition fight and are equally in their group with the Britishs on the first place that continues to be triggered after their 2-0 winning against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday on the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the fourth-final, the game will decide which both of the group of six teams will reach the first and second place.
The first placed will go from the strong hole countries a little longer from the way to lead to the other group.
As always the game can go on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising mixture through their success history, four years after they landed at the last 12 places at London games.
Bam was part of this team.
She started in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time in three years, she had a hockey shock in hands (that's two old sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years of age, she became a national player in the United States, the most recently in the history of the team.
She passed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the Framework.
Then the year 2012, in which she and her team slaughtered everything for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, a English country, trainer of the National Team, began to apply the things to better.
"An cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the jobs in London that we had now.
We've been able to get the route completely.
On Thursday Bam opened the Torrents in the first half of the game with a backup from the native area.
Although it was without winning in the tournament, but the team showed himself surprising, and maintained the state of play of 1-0 to the third fourth, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flanking ball over the left flanke, then moved to the middle and led the ball in the gate to make a 2-0 lead to the Americans.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last neighborhood.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tourner for the United States tournament Jackie Briggs, who had to get a door in each of the previous games.
She's got a way.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it's going to depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the round of the Olympic Games, the center of the Trampolin
Whereever you are, how late it is, they're the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel a slightly and uncertainty, a rather stake between competitive and trials.
It's like the olympic fake itself a brushing stab that is available from the arms to the swimming swimming to the tower to the triathlete.
You can't enable the television to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's still a Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first time at the Olympic games, and a woman's warm with sweet, could be among these known names that were sent to the first time, built by sponsors and well-being TV if he would be a sweet, turner or even swimming.
But Dooley, 28, from the Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic Trampolin tours.
The Olympic flag does not light any event equally.
More from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports that are not generally recognized: air pitoles, boats, bath minton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the shooting and we'll be able to rule it for a long time.
But if I do awarely arguments for my own love, then let me give the attention to the discred shape of the trampolin.
Although the trampolin spring has been an olympic event since 2000, as it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years were so spectacular that many of those I asked had not knew that it was an olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. Athletes sent to the competition fight, there has never been a medaille in the trampolin springs and had a athlete that has done it until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians aim to share the prices for men and Chinese and Canadians to share the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLenan from Canada this year will defend their gold medals from London.
The trampolin spring has a certain foreign chair, partly because it is suitable for the unexpected ears for a clown school than that for the Olympic games.
In this place, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a connected discovery.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartonic citers never to end its opposition - but also thanks to the tourn and smoking, the two sports, which join it in the most important.
The word "Trampolin" is from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Sprungbrett".
Encouraging winners switch on a gigantic trampolin, shoot almost 30 feet in the air and have to have a series of movements (which, heat, and salts), before they are on the feet of the country.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme following implementation, difficulty and "floor time".
Twenty-third atletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will come to each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is just out.
Medaillers must continue to gold in their strikes, faster, up and up, sometimes to go, sometimes to go back, to top and down on the game place.
They are not only the target lines or the starting channels, but also a higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted goal is novel, admired, even fanatically - and it is enough to smell even a observer to smile.
But it's also what I think of myself when I look at these games as something embarrassing.
The trampolin offers a breathpause.
The vector of the trampolin springer is above.
A previous movement is not the goal.
He or she smells, like a astronaut, goes up, then go down, then unlikely turn up.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wheels in the television, only the dreamer, elegant relief of time and weakness.
It's so nervous as the competition in the Olympic games can only be.
The qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday, in the strife at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will be extracted as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.
Within the Olympic Machine, they promise a quiet, nice moment, who will probably be overlooked in general tumor.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the acquisition and objection of men's athletes - as the US men's tourner said the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his ringing, new fan communities.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a member of the United States
Protest force in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who call political changes in Ethiopia are struggling towards violent resistance of the government.
The Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the compositions with the police in shock changes.
Is Ethiopians just going to break together?
In the past ten years, it was one of the most stabil African countries, a solid partners of the West with a fast growing economy.
But in the past months, protests were assaulted against the government, and there were always more areas.
Last week, thousands of people were on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The Government's response was unclean, according to human rights organizations.
The Witnesses told the police that zig unarmed demonstrates shooted and killed.
Simply in the round of videos about the Protests, which probably are from the last or early this year, shows how youths shocked with shocks, while they were forced to make a action against a wall.
The Chief of UN Human Rights Auditors now requires an inadequate investigation.
"It was always hard to keep this country together and will be even more difficult," said Rashid Dibit, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a group of research.
Ethiopians are estimated by Nigeria the most popular country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services are closely working with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if they are sure, receive such western assistance.
Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable time.
His infrastructure has been drastly improved - there is a new rent in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to undermine the government - the opposition in the country was limited to the opposition, which has been effectively imposed by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed, or tried to the deserts.
But that could change.
"If you push people and have no other options to protest, it comes out," said Seyoum Teshome, a dozen in central translathiopians.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover all of the land use to the deterioration of the power of the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the Governing Party and its associates received the last seat of the opposition and now controlled 100% of the Parliament.
At the same time, the shocks increased from the border to Eritrea; a fight against this shocked, surrounded line requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separators such as Oromo's release front or the national freedom front of Ogad, which have been more or less inflicted in the past years, could use the turbulences and can be weakened again.
A number of factors explain why the feelings of advertising are now explosed under the surface for years.
The first seems harmless: Smartphones.
In the last few years, very many ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, since more smartphones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government shows access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing in regular distances, especially in Protests, many people can still communicate through Internet processes that hide where they stop.
Many young ethiopians acknowledged that they were so assembled to protesters.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two major ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemy.
Since the Yeons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopians overly from high Christian countries, prospered in the policy and economy, while exhibiting the oromos, many of whose muslims are and live in flash areas.
But it's just changed.
"We are there to coordinate under a shift," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests were found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which represent around 6 percent of the population and dominate in the military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for disappointed ones is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ex-revoluntary leader, was until his death at a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years, the first minister of Ethiopians.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the edge.
Analysts say that he was specially distributed in the way to observe early signs of inadequacy and to use special advisers to edit the enemy and make them unfortunately.
"The current regime has lacked it to this fundamental ship," said Mr. Dibbas, a conflict-nalyticer.
The Ethiopians of the new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, were elected in relatively unspeakable reasons to accept the position of Mr Meles.
On the other hand, Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray North Ethiopian region, comes from the south.
Analytics say he does not enjoy trust in the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood damage.
The last time the Ethiopias experienced such a rise was 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which, according to the information of analytics, seemed to have been prevented by the government and then stolen.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disappointment was relatively fast.
Development experts gave the Ethiopia leaders for their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendal League, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal deficiency of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month Protestants in Gondar, an amharic city, took businesses from Tigray, and Hass against Tigray will become more common in social media.
Analytics say that the Protests bring the U.S. and other Western associations into a unique position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronen flights over the nearby Somalia, even though recently she informed that she closed this base.
While westerns clearly want to support democracy, he does not want to join his partners in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Divid, "it's a very thin grain migration."
Donald Trump declared his statement Obama founded by ISIS or "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to destroy the last contraverse around his campaign by acknowledging that his several times repeated statements, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not seriously common for the terrorist group of Islamic State.
This explanation made new questions on the communications capacity of the President of the Republicns to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.
It also brings his partners to protect him during a appropriate stage, in the own position to explain comments that he couldn't have shared.
After he had done the andauction at a election campaign at midday, Mr. Trump returned to the holding on Thursday and was in Interviews that he really noted to be aware of the President and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a premature twitter on Friday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The twitter was the opposite to the previous day in which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said that the accused was completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to defeat the speech by reminding him that Mr Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican Presidency candidate wanted nothing to know about it.
The last stage of the criticism is on Mr Trump, while he tried to spend the focus on his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech.
Mr. Trump has already provided Sarkasmus to his defence.
In the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but later he explained, "I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language borders into the policy and then call back after need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive, and then "class" after how the reaction comes." Ruth Sherman, a expert of communication that observes the language of both candidates.
But I believe that it is also clear enough to keep his words low enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of renewing the sound for the election of the presidency, Mr Trump has adopted a more accurate sound, since his values have continued.
A new survey from NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the United States of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-rent in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his caused statements, he often accuses his critics to destroy his words or to understood his humor.
However, while he is strengthening the attention in the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trumps' Scherze has put his loyal partners into the uncomfortable situation to him to stand, independently of how to cause his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former citizensman of New York and one of the most prominent preachers of Trumps, has made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think he's saying legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked on the rightness of Mr Trumps, whether Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton had found the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS, it was an unknown, small organization, he called her interfaces, perfectly wrong, and because he took out the troops from Iraq.
The majority of Mainstream Republics try to argue that the government under Obama, Mrs Clinton, served as a Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to extend its expansion by imposing the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and proposed to spend on each of his words and to be taken against him.
He increased the "weapon, weapons" television experts that try to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some democratics urged Mr Trump's apologize only to be another evidence that he was inadequate for the President.
Once the price of the market is broken, Caf√© returns to Greenpoint
Verb coffee was a sweet coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi, but it served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from Bedford Avenue Ladenefront have been raised.
The Soap Cherie business, replaced the Verb in the summer 2014, sells in the form of Cupcakes.
Inhabitantly it was the last loss in a generating city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, out of the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a seventh business."
But if New York is changed, it's also a new regeneration.
A rebuilt Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one miles north of his original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar slow atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employer of the old coffee, the owner and business leader of the new coffee.
He began to work with the Verb 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to prepare money for a new foreign area, he was urged to do it, said he.
Rodriguez, 36.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels buyed the same Espressmasin model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new additives.
On the food map, there are sandwiches with spectacles and kitchens and there are garnitures such as captures and saubered swivels.
There are natural shoes.
The coffee no longer serves bird, there are fried skins.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noted a steady electric of old seeds.
"A lot of old customers were also slowed by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
On Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, was previously living in Williamsburg and visited regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After closing the complaint, she gave the coffee a minute, she said.
"I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even when she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of their usual iced coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-year customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and, unfortunately, always ordered the same.
"I came fourteen after seven, every day, like a Swiss taste offerer and they prepare my allthing bag with Butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his allthing bag with speck, egg and skin.
Rodriguez said he wasn't denied about the fact that the shipment has taken the old business room.
Indeed, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special sweet for swimmingness with the cold coffee of the coffee.
"I think we will still take on her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polandese Greenpoints also accepted the coffee.
A new customer has translated the food card to the Poland and Rodriguez said he intended to make them so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location also has further proposals.
A local saftlocal wants to fill and sell the cold coffee in the floor.
There is an opportunity to expand the coffee to a nearby building.
For many customers, there is a new ban to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a folk and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee closed.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the participation of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a homekee.
"I had to ride it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich food time"
In March 1933, after his presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a facility for raffined delicts of the Fifth Avenue such as Patate de la fera grass and Maryland water shield suppe.
His menu at this day was something more discreet: pleased eggs in tomato sauce, cartoffelpuree and as dessert a plume pudding.
"It was a act of collinary solidarity with leading people," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes the last book "Chop Suey" was conducted by the Chinese kitchen in the United States while Zegelman in his book "97 Orchard" about life in a residence house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A compliance of food", which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, slightless imbis in the Flatiron district, which has already been in business since the B√∂rsencrash 1929.
Zegelman, 54, ordered a fresh swimming swimming with oil bags, while coe, 57, swimming with cartofloor and vegetable mixing.
When the reporter named Hackbrot, the couple found it appropriate for a debate on the food at the time of the Great Depression.
"The rich foods were very popular", said Siegelman.
There was soil brown, lever bones and bottle brown.
They were prepared from an additive and something pleasant that strikes the adventure.
Make sure to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as a dinner.
You're sweet.
"It must have been stolen in the magic as a wheel," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
Managers of women purchased for men's field workers and it has been freely backed pastees for breakfast, breakfast and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War War. "A Square Meal" marked the ways to which the country turned to be no longer the Slavich country.
"It was a time when the food was a central, encouraging theme for the Americans," Coe favoured why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget was also encouraging: secret foods such as bread and caserolls were made to basic foods that casserols were "which wonderful to restore the food rates", noted by Gigelman, since the kitchen was able to hide in a creative sugar.
Fresh fruit was replaced by bigger seed fruit.
The meat of the United States kitchen was a rarely served Luxus.
Personal misconceptions were tested because a calorian rich and attractive satisfaction was priority for shocking or even healthy kitchen.
During its search for the book, which also includes the receptives, the seeds prepared a court from this epoch, backed swivels with groundsbatters.
"It wasn't a favorite addition on the midst", says Coe.
Seegelmann continues to say, "It was surreal."
Boilers and backed swimming swimming swimming snacks do not match each other.
It was typically for many of the budget receptions.
As never before or since, budgetary managers, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Home Economics, are in place between 1923 and 1943.
In publishing receptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, women encouraged them to become "budgetary politicians" and to be justified by the challenge of transforming pamps such as creme spaghetti with karotes in cooking times.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical lecker beasts.
In particular, the reports on the response of the Government to the hunger citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cine-Essen.
While he publicly loving the simple Iowa farmer house cooked his kitchen, he spent like the million thick man of the world to whom he became.
"He might have a continental kitchen like a fish with guckensauce," said Coe.
He eated in a almost rolled food room and took a smoking.
He was greatly reality friend.
President Roosevelt may have started the same error if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his mages.
As described in the book, a householder was not interested in smells by Mrs Roosevelt, so that the White House produced the most longest food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortlessly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression were rejected when the country returned to the leg.
The richness is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Zegelman, and on how food science was applied.
The couple gave a better understanding of the habits of Siegelman's mother's swimming mother, for example, how they couldn't remove food.
"He had a real fear of the abuse of food," said Coe.
Zegelman recalled: "They actually made people sick."
There was the wind-wheel event.
After the teachers were displaced at Eisenberg, they and Coe moved a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Flauming Steel, the President Roosevelt eat at midday.
"It will be called Prune Whip," said Vegelman, and added that it was a common trick to pass a sent name.
There was no strike shoes, only plants, some meat, sugar, water and Zimt.
Everyone slaughtered a lift in the dense, brown lebbers.
It was surprising that it wasn't bad.
Coe tried to get a shock.
As a can-do-budget-budget said to his wife, "A few haired whales would help."
Murdered at bomb attack: He was the herd of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the herd of Aleppo: Khaled Omar lived the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old one died at a fassboom attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that saved the life up to about 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers make their own lives on the game to drive people from shocked houses and to provide the first help in the war area.
You're the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protectioner, which showed him in a 11-year-old savior of a pool from a house, went to the world in 2014.
It made the Syrer to the lighting symbol in the grain of the war.
When he himself never saw himself, he said, "For me, this is the true Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself lost an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helikopters have cut four fass bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorogas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from Atemnot.
"We remove now the giftous remains of the bomb so that children do not play it", the image cites his last words before he died.
The mortal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Gr√∂nlandhai: The oldest workshop is almost 400 years old
Rare look.
Gr√∂nlandhaie is usually in winter only on the surface.
This Hai returned to the sea after an investigation on the board of Sanna's research ship.
He was born 1624 and was born with a good 1 km/h through North Atlantics - up to today.
Gr√∂nlandhaie is only obtained with 150 years of education.
The Gr√∂nlandhai slows on the ground of North Atlantics, in a hour, it comes just 1.220 meters away.
Only when it arrives, the 5 meters long animal speeds on 2.5 km/h - and is with this maximum speed half soon as a robot.
But this long-term life style seems to be a patterncept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the Section "Science" every case by a Gr√∂nlandhai who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn" comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life level, which means a world record for workers.
Although the evolutional biologues had long been shocked by Gr√∂nland‚Äôs stones.
Only the evidence missed.
Gr√∂nland Haies are difficult to observe, finally they live mostly in the Eismes before the beaches of Canada, Gr√∂nland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures for the six degrees of Celsius, they are mostly in winter.
Regarding the lifestyle of the Gr√∂nland Haie, researchers know little accordingly.
They made their time of time when they employed six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
Nevertheless, these hairs do: in the magic of a animal, researchers found the rest of a robot, the other had shooted the kitchens of a young irongart.
They may be kissing sleeping animals or patropulating in the light of the eisme and searching for cattles from higher water swimming down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Gr√∂nlandhaie, which helped fishermen from 2010 to 2013 before Groenland or Spitzbergs as a start of the North Atlantic depth.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters was.
To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14-methods the lineners of the hair.
This center of the eyeslinse is already undergoing before the birth of the Haie, which are contained in its proteins will not be renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of coal-14 in the linzener.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as the nuclear weapons surveyed more quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.
However, in which with 220 centimeters of the three-century animal the lingery was a low overcome of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons request, it should therefore have been celebrated in his investigation in 2012 at its 50th birthday.
However, all the larger Gr√∂nlands had normal carbon 14-mans in their lines, which produces cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
Indeed, the CO2-14-uur showed a age of 335 years of age, while the record-hai with 502 centimeters should even be 392 years old.
That Gr√∂nlandhai women were known only when they were more than four feet.
Now the researchers were able to order a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters standed at the sleeve of sex and was determined to be 156 years of age, Gr√∂nlandhaie is obviously allowed to measure at least a half a century.
This should also be for the weaker today's world recruitment.
That such methusure lives primarily in ice waters is no accident.
The previous recorder, a 211-year-old Groenlandwal, in which a 120-year-old spectacle was captured before Alaska.
With low temperatures, also the organism of the living animals are often walking on sparflooms.
So they're late and older.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume increases much higher than its surface, by which the heat of the animal.
The warm loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: you have less enemies.
"A smaller animal, therefore, is more dangerous and should concentrate on it, as soon as possible, to have many seeds", says the Evolutional Biological Scheerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life.
Double pack
With the issues around the buildings, the Council of the Communities has severely discussed in the recent meeting.
With facility, the body noted the communication of Mr Robert Putz that "the marketing of recent housing lands can eventually be started".
After closing the base, parcelling and resolution issues and the applications for measuring could be made, the sale of the bases in the residence areas "Stra√üweg" and "S√∂nau-West" (Ambiguous Binderstra√üe Section 1) is no more interested in the way.
The Council is convinced that the buildings in the rurally prescribed and tranquilous housing area are equal to young families and gorgeous seniors.
As it is said, there can be immediate reports on the Council's house, on the delivery of the parcels, the Council will be consulted in its September meeting.
In order to be able to follow requests for other enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the Community Council decided to amend the area-use plan established first in the early year of this year.
In this way, there are two parts of the State Strategy 2112 in the sub-time area.
Frankfurt benefited from Brexit
The city in Main has the best opportunity to take places and businesses from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits mostly from Brexit v√¥tum," says Michael Voigtl, Chief of the Financial Market and IW Income Market.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertainly that money households can continue from London from financial business in the whole EU.
For the so-called EU pass, they have yet been authorized in Britain.
It's just useful US banks.
several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates with 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, as in the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB) is talking about the responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Monitoring EIOPA and the Risk Council.
In Paris the OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this is less important than the ECB.
"The nearness to the bank is important for banks, since they can communicate so directly with the supervision", says the IW Professor of Guanga.
However, Luxembourg has a large fund sector, but also decreased as Dublin in infrastructure.
Frankfurt, thanks to the great airport, is clearly easier to reach.
Moreover, the city has easy shopping real estate.
"In Paris, it is not so simple to find high-quality offices", says the Voigtle countries.
Moreover, the expenses for first-class shopping real estate are up to 50 percent higher than the main.
Frankfurt also offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical supply and infrastructure, as well as less criminality.
Mercer was located at the seventh places, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin at place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
While the quality of life is a question of the preferences: "In the case of his strong position as a financial position for the European market, Frankfurt could join further banks and investors," says the WI.
However, in spite of Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, I believe the economic researchers.
For this, the forces relates: In London, there were about 144.000 people in the bank industry, which were 62.500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent Streit with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc had access to the refund of the legal costs that she had led to the Hepatite C Law with the Pharmacist Markk & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released by a damage payment of $200 million for the injury of two market patents, which stood in relation to the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US-relator had a markks pattern of misconduct, including my idea and other unthic acts.
On Thursday, the complainant at the U.S. Officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has access to the exemption of costs during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead that controls the market of hepatitis C medicines that can improve more than 90% of patients with hepatitis disease.
The case returns back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck were declared mutually and ownershipd on labor work, which was based on Sofosbuvir, the active content substance in the medicines of Gilead.
The United States supported soldiers say they have returned to full control over Man near the Islamic State
The complete control over the northern city of Man near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left them in the city, said a group speaker on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now the city after the exit of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as a shock, Sharfan Darwish shared the man near the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we are just conducting rooms through", he said Reuters.
Clintons won 10,75 million in 2015 and pay 34,2% Federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday 2015, which took a revenue of $10.75 million and a effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Presidency candidate of Democratics and their husband.
In 2015, Clintons deployed USD 1 million for a favourable purpose, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton produced almost 5,3 million USD in Redehororans; the former Foreign Minister has increased a income of $3 million from the Dutch Simon & Schuster for its book on its official time in the foreign minister.
Clinton's Candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, publicly announced with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continued to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a slow opposition, Donald Trump is hidden from false explanations and backfalls in relation to its previous discussions.
It is generally to publish its tax statements for the US Presidency candidates, although they are not bound by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"He's on the train," wrote Clinton's election assistor Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the Presidential Chairman of Democratics.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, the Special Adviser of Trumps, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests were completed.
Trumps Critics, including the Republic of Presidential Chairman of 2012, have already endorsed that his refusal to matters relating to the ability, its costs to engage in organizations, its business opportunities and various links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already discussed the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in order to publish its tax statement on the high-ranging Republican Trump.
On Thursday she also spoke the topic during a talk to the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other candidate has done in the last decades and to publish its tax statements." she said to the amount.
Political reported that Trump had not paid for two years or only very little taxes, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax applicants and tax advisers that indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme designated by the Millennium and Investor Warren Buffet, which would ensure that people who pay more than one million USU would pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, a buffet called for the Berkshire Hathaway Industrie Conglomerate, whose seat is here to share a meeting on their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to a fiscal examination of the IRS and Trump had a "trump" before the electioners and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax statement back to 2007.
The Clintons, who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, in the meantime paid a effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combinated tax rate of about 40.5%.
The tax statement of the Clintons in 2015 showed that these only shared 100 USD of their income as a loan, other than the majority of all Americans.
Your main currency allocation was a more cost-favorable index fund, from which the Clinton's Dividents and Income from US 109.000 taxed.

Condome with chilipuds, fire bodies promote Tanzanias Elefanten protection
Natural protectors in Tansania use an unorthodox type to stop elephants to go in people's population seeds - they shrink condomes that are filled with chilipuds.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US Natural Protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tansanias to use a weakening method for protecting their homes and rewards without harming animals.
Many of them have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world's celebration of animal protection.
"When we developed the toolkit, we could observe a change in their position within these communities, while they are much more convinced that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," the director of Honeyguide Damian Bell expressed in a communication.
The first two steps include the shooting of the elephant with a shock and the blowing into a horn.
If he isn't crazy, a cyliwolke will be shocked.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire body in a condom, which is turned to the end to the thread.
When it is cut up, the condome is cut up with a kidnapper and split a slipper of chilipuder in the air.
A swimming shooting is normally in order to spend the elephants.
A last possibility is an advertiser who shoots a golden rain fire in the air and causes a slight, light explosion.
City Council decides unilaterally: No Kiosknbau on St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects of customers with cuss hands are taking - but only the individual trade in the nuclear city is clearly developable.
However, with the request to rebuild a sale shop at the Rheinufer immediately near the rock baron in the construction of the city‚Äôs shipping baron, the Council now decreased.
"We welcome new competitors, but in this position exposed to the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not pass", explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish Governor deceives the Berlin Hotel, because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "Arabian" invitation - RT News
A French government with Jewish roots surveyed a media survey after surprised that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preference, since it was called by an Arab guest "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" left his injuries in Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing a open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country office of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and removed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through a own call centre.
After a statement, the government went to the hotel reception.
The answer he got there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure is a "absolute decision on the management of the Kempinski Hotels".
The reason that was there was, the government resolved more wrath.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the war is removed," was sent by Lanzmann.
The Israeli poster in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Southern newspaper.
We were cut from this event and struggled.
It's really awesome.
The fact that this in Germany has reached in exactly this hotel chain is even more harmful.
This does not require any declaration.
We hope that the hotel is "the right conclusions", said the Officer.
The incident made a very great resonance on the Internet, where people were called a scandal.
Some understood the Kempinski Hotel that it had been the appropriate calls for Arab guests "again".
"Shome you," said another contribution, in which it was indicated that the hotel situated in the noble curve dam, is near a synagogue.
The hotel slowly shocked all the accused of himself and called the incident a "verfeiting" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," the Southern newspaper quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country's preference has now been added.
Police places Tr√∂ngas and Gummi shoes against protesting Brazilian students
Students met the police together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police shocked the shooting gas and shoes against the demonstrates.
The difficulties argued that as police officers tried to interfere with students, which resulted in the use of Gummi shoot and gas.
Many hundreds of students participated in the demonstrations to express their threat to the plans.
According to the proposals of the Government of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to shoot money.
Some of the protesters were seen Graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temper at the wall.
The most recent protests took place a few days after the demonstrators in Mass on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been deleted by a senator's vote to their departure from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increased by 71% - RT Business
With the restraint of sanctions, the Russian messanger in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran in comparison with 70.9 per cent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were decreased, the interest on Russian enterprises in business in the country was strongly able to share the messagers.
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to create access to the market.
Of course, the further trade development is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade sum between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased 91.5% springly and $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent of $158 million.
The trade was reached by delivery of machines, aircrafts and weapons," said the messager.
Dzhagaryan is exhibited by a number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign association exhibited around 35,000 visas, in the main line of travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
On the other hand, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the tourist number in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only few Russians visit Iran, something from which the messager hopes that it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that the monuments of the old Persian civilization have received in a good condition," he said.
Tests Search: Overcome the drinking market in the bowlbr oil
On Thursday Thursday, on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the forest blower swimming streets, a swimming accident has been displaced.
With the maintenance of a shooting weapons, three darkly closed persons who had conscious of their faces requested the production of bargeld and then flew first on foot and then probably with a silver VW-golf.
The police does not share the money.
The murders should have been large between 1.60 and 1.70 m, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and badly adjustable from the parking of the rewe market.
The murders must be shooted in direction towards Gerber Streets, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flyed by the parking park with the silver colored car, perhaps in direction B 256 (slaughtering).
Those who have been observing at 19.45 p.m. in relation to the shooting accident must be reported urgently to the police.

Hagerloch: Pilgers to endurance of kindness
The Ministers of the Seelorge Unit Eyachtal-Hangerloch St. Anna were on a four-day migration of Virginia to Freeburg.
In common cases, four steps were stored.
In order to overcome the time until the next Romwalt journey of all ministers, two years, the Supreme Ministerround St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multiannual migration.
A number of Wallway targets were examined and finally decided to be the Bishops City Freeburg, where, this year, after the holy Year of Barmherity, a special pillar was offered by the Freeburg M√ºnster.
16 Mines of supplies, gruol, hair, and sanctuary rooms were made on the path.
On the evening, Pharaoh Storost sent the Pilger to a small party in St. Anna, blessed the Pilger Cross and distributed the pillars.
From Horb was moved by train to the start point of Villing, where a monster of our loves was also a woman, and so the pillar journey was taken from the munster.
The individual day tours were rounded by a short impuls with various prayers, songs and texts.
But on the way, the minis of field crystals, crowns or churches always again were to sing together a song of their own-composed piller song.
For the overnights, the Pharaoh houses of the local parreies were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were careful for a quiet and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went on fortwangs to Gu√™tenbach.
On the day, the step went to St. Peter, who was the most strict road, had to slow up about 500 meters of height and then be shocked again.
The winning reward was finally a common grill on the bathroom.
After the morning's impetus on the fourth pillar day in the imposing clergy of St. Peter, it was on the closure table to Freeburg.
It seems to be easy and happy to the minis on afternoon on the Freeburg monsters and extended the courages of mercy.
With a small impuls, God has been grateful here.
In the midst of the monastery, the Minister of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilger target.
After God‚Äôs service, the pillars could consider the sacred and the higher.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumeterpole.
The afternoon it went back to Horb.
All participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were presented.
Shotte Callum Skinner shoots home when British Gold for Radsport
Skotlands Callum Skinner last night in the men's spring team in the Velodrom in Rio to the rihm, when the British team defended London's title in 2012.
The 23-year-old boy of Glasgow took the role of his countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The boy point was proud of the legends when he went home to a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England requested a shocking victory four years ago, while today the fifth of six Olympiagold medailles.
They repeated the trick, after they helped only a clear sixth place in March at the Railway World Meetings in London, despite the return of Hoys.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this just as Hindus.
Hoys Quietstand created a laugh trying to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man in whom she left when she saw the potential in the shoot that now disappeared.
Independent, Kenny, who had seen with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners, put an olympic receptor in the qualifications rounds, but in the standard rounds, the new countries wined in the first round.
And the British Trio wins the dual with gold.
Indeed, after his round, Kenny was back, but Kenny brought the team before and Skinner took it.
A strategic change made a major part of the transformation in which Hindus went into a higher gang to delay it and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the time.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and cut Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they stood on the power.
The 23-year-old skinner of Glasgow said, "It's a weird comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set an olympic repair at the end of the end and the world's master.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes gave him a weak start on the train.
He later returned this statement, and there was no invoice of England's rivals.
There was no such problem at such an overwhelming victory this time.
Inded said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We've been so bad with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again with the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, who won seven of 10 titles both in Peking and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expected to be successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form of Kenny is in the area of the possibility that he can win from three olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny, which was just 12 years older than Hoy, which was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for the British sport; on the day, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - means an exhibition of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same thing by Hoy.
Kenny takes the next part in the sprint that starts today and goes over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team's heritage is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels something alone to win alone.
Inded said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be shocked to the rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owan Doull were qualified with the fastest performance of the four-kilometer trails.
They reached the objective in 3:51,942.
The World Reorder, winned in London's Gold 2012, was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) is in place today on the second day of competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
Last night he had struggled with officers before the qualification when he was calling officers to measure his body size.
In the relevant competitive competitive, which is continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia in World Record at 4:13.260.
The GB team is on its strong station radar team to dominate the average period of the Olympic games and take a sharp of medailles.
After a truly extraordinary exhibition of absolute dominance in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were understood.
There were dramas in the background, so the retreat of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mobing, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of competition in the Velodrom, it seems to be repeated as the legendary call of GBs, who has reached its point at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's sleeves is demandingly due to the reducing of the energy contract
The future of Portland's Aluminium Skills in Victoria, as well as hundreds of employees' jobs, is on the game, since the installation operators advertise the energy delivery contract and then will decrease all delivery contracts, as provided by the supplier's energy companies.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria in the beginning of this year to forgive no further subsidies for the operation of the installation.
A subvention set for 20 years shall expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa installation in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - directs and indirect - could be threatened when closing.
Furthermore, it could be to domino effects, as the smell series consums around 10% of the entire generation of Victorias.
2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which leaded to a closure of the English power work last year.
The seal of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the annual speculations regarding the future of the installation, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and finally because of the strike for the installation.
The AGL, which delivered the large aluminium ring with its Loy Yang A Kraftwerk in the Latrobe Valley, shared it that three other owners would be announced their contracts.
The installation is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp is smaller.
"AGL understood that the installation in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity through the steel seed," the company shared.
AGL continued to declare that the contracts, as called "safeguard business", should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month proclaiming period so that they will end 2017.
"For this reason, AGL concludes that the contracts will be contributed to the income in the commercial year 17", said the supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the prognoses of the strong terminal markets for large-scale routes.
The AGL reported that it had already registered the value of the contracts in its annual decree of $187 million in "Warning a claim".
Alcoa said that the decision to register the contracts, the "Caicity Alcoas... or to ensure electricity supply to the slopes" does not affect.
The US undertaking said that it had concluded a 20-year treaty with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still a statement why it was returned to the Treaty.
Analyticers warned because of the bad economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago Installation near Newcastle.
As regards the comments of the analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consums about 600 megawatt and Tomago about 900 megawatt in electricity.
If both installations disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [Strom market].
And for us, it wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a cardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue
Kenndall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Crisis is on the cover of the employed September Exhibition of Vogue.
Kenndall, the Markenschafter of Estee Lauder and delivered to the Fashion Weeks in Mayland, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their instagram account.
"In a room of full people I loved, I brought the view of this copper to wine," wrote Kendall.
The integration of the covers followed a strange (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashians family (except the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz monks and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forgot the cover of her sister and ends with a classic view: they all planned a part of surprise.
This represents the clinical detention nearly every birthday seventh of a child's seat (Seacrest said, "Do you think we had forgotten you?", with the honestity of a sign trickcanin on a sending place at 8:00 a.m.), but the crisis of her other girls had to take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new time of the Kardashian began with security.
Kendall's large sister Kim likes to be struck about the Vogue-Cover (see and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the Cover of September‚Äôs magazine is a liga for himself.
The expenditure for September is the most sales expenditure of the year.
A large number of advertising advertising advertising (See Fashionista was 832 pages of the tree 615 pages of advertising).
The enthusiasming of his coverstars is so slightly expected that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still overseeing before the official advertisement.
Women already on the copper include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past years, obviously, there were more "models, models" than "models, which are famous" on the cover.
Oscar-President and Dior-Markebourer Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even the small opportunity that Ms. Jenner, which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbroch model" model of its generation, falls under the previous category, is located in a good society.
These famous audiences are not associated with famous people or reality Stars or youths from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (such as it applies everything to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are representing themselves in the entertainment sector.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was published by Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the modern world was always encouraging.
In June, the one Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid critised her "the mist of the moment".
These feelings come back up when the message with the appearing Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be overlooked at the point.
Kenndall Jenner is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue.
She is a super model in the real sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all their sisters sell pictures from you on their own Paywall apps.
She sells from her images from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she is to see in the reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kurtney and her children.
Common law centres indicate each year 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the aid needs of the country are declined annually by the Community law centres, while the sector has taken place on the effects of further means-free transactions already exceededed.
In Queensland there are already three of five persons - most older people, immigrants, helpful employees, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unrighteous declarations and similar - when requests for free legal consultations and legal assistance.
The legal services of the community, which are already exceededed, are prepared for further burdens.
Since June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose more than 30 per cent of their federal resources.
The Director of the Common Rights Centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last relief of the National Association of Common Rights has shown that thousands of people are already discarded each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be worse without a delay of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's Common Rights Centres are chronically financed, which means that thousands of people from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unspectacular and impressable debts, families that go through separations, workers who have been dismissed unjustly - all of these people have problems of legal nature and this intelligence shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will shorten the resources to 30%, which means that thousands of people from Queensland will be forced to respond to their legal problems without any assistance.
We call on the general lawyer and the Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to spend these shortages immediately, so that people can receive the aid they need in legal problems.
Last year, the country's government complied its contribution to increase legal aid in the national average.
It is now at the time to look at the needs of the Common Rights Centres and its customer communities and that the Palestinian government investes in this important work.
Donald Trump Select campagne acknowledged after employees to go to the weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sentenced for an inactivity after you were informed that her Championship Chief for North Carolina in February had a shooting weapons on a employee, while they walked in a Jeep in February.
The case is described in a letter of appeal submitted by Vincent Bordini on midnight by Charlotte, a former software program for the campaign in this State.
Bordini agreed to have expected for months that the matter would be regulated within before he realized that "it would not happen".
The Championship Chief, Earl Philip, moved a pistole, put his right guard fingers off, and took the walk in Vincents Kniekehle," gave Bordini in his charge.
After he considered the local and regional campaign, Bordini realized that at least four other people had experienced with Phillip, he acknowledged in the accused record.
"The weapons must not be shooted to harm", said Bordini.
The accused comes only two days after the Republican Presidency candidate dissolved a surrender when he said a human dimension in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - the shooter and weapons friends - should take action if his rivalin Hillary Clinton is chosen and should call the judges.
Trump's campaign clearly stated that the media would have left his words out of the context and that he would not attack violence.
The complaint demands the injury of the campaign to violate the responsibilities and Philip because of physical damage and remaining seal damage.
Trump's predictor Hope Hicks was not reached for an opinion.
Try to contact Philip also missed.
WCCB, a local newspaper in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is not long-term employees of the campaign.
The calls at his consulting companies, innovative consultation services, were not reacted.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump has led to a controverse campaign.
The procedure was established by Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Sween: Research against country choice: lost SPD and CDI
In the subsequent elections in the Federal States, Mecklenburg Forums (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the Government party SPD and CDI.
This provides representative investigations from the InSA Opinion Institute for the "Image" publication (Freeday).
While the red-free government coalition could soon be registered in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In the two federal countries, however, the SPD would have the strongest party and would have a good opportunity to continue to put the government head.
In Mecklenburg, the SPD was 35.6 per cent of five years ago at 24 per cent.
The Party, according to the survey, was only just before the DDC, which could return to 23%.
The third place is round between the left and the AfD.
The left was 19 percent (before 18.4%), the ADD would first be 19 percent in the countryside.
In spite of easier losses, greens returned to the black landday of 6 per cent (before 8,7%).
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent on the land day.
In the Berlin Deputy House, the SPD is only 23% of the survey (Warning 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU only reached 18% after 23.4%.
It was still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but before the left with 15 percent (forwardly 11,7%).
The AfD would first be 14% in the House of Deputy.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would, on the contrary to 2011, pass the income.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device was almost half kilograms and was more than four times so hard as a iPhone 5.
It was smooth and larger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was very flexibility.
At first eight megabytes, which would be limited to about two semi with high resolution today.
A iPhone is supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in business, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, favorite devices can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somewhere from the stone time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sense.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer announced the product a few months ago on the computer measuring Cebit in Hannover as "B√ºro in the Western Tower Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the current standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent, even by fax, to reach the communicationr.
Even the access to web sites was possible by HTML browser, even slowly.
A load computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenne, and the phone could be stored like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-wheel screen.
The price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392.
Nobody could admit in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the start of the Smartphone era.
Since then, it's different.
The bad phones are a success history, even if not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finn experienced a playless disaster, was finally sold and completed to Microsoft.
Today, the market dominates providers who were all later coming as Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is for many people today.
2015 has been worldwide nearly 2 billion Smartphone users.
Only 555 million pieces were sold for about 1,4 billion machines, on collection and apple.
The global transfer with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
These are the good run-up businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications centres.
A whole industry has been round around the smartphone.
The crucial interruption to the masses market was first early in 2007, then the head of Apple Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communicationer, everything by a touch screen easy to use.
Apple's victory began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the concert.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the view.
They finally lost to fight Blackberry.
The seage now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The Smartphone is an autonomy than 20 years after its introduction.
In the cut today, every German looks 88 times on the day of his phone.
"We all have to learn to get out of the smartphone again," just said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
Persistent accessibility applies to wickedness and blessings as well.
England must spend the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow is not only in our local communities and in the whole of London, but also in the whole country renewing and well-being.
For me, this was the greatest attraction Heathrows, as in 2012 in London, when we employed a great encouraging to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade had great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And this will be re-established by creating new opportunities for local accommodations and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we'll be alone with 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were predicted in London 2012, it will be given that the challenge of Heathrows extension is too large.
I was said that England will never be ready for the games and that we will burn on the world's blows.
The dubbles had injustice 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that he has made.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not individuals.
Advancement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, ¬£211 billion to wise growth and leave a ability and employment risk for both the airport and the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a ¬£11 billion teen infrastructure investment program in time and budget, was chosen from T5 to five years after the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the world's two most frequency.
Now they are willing to provide a third stage, which is supported by US$16 billion to private investments.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be also one.
It is time that we spend this olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a richness of qualifications and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook on "Katz and mouse game"
For enterprises who pay money with online delivery, one of the software manufacturers tries to implement an indication block, equal to a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on his desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post that the users could update their filters in the program in order to re-block the advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertising in order to detect the display blocks of which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that there was a new way to run the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "This kind of fight between the spectacular open source Community and the circle is already in the gate, and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media companies have entered into the fight is a strong indication for how more careful display blockers have become for the sector.
Worldwide uses a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people's show blockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who are accessing to Facebook on their mobile advertising, 84% of the Facebook advertisements are available.
The company has seen it on advertising blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile display blockers have no effect on mobile Facebook's application for the social network and instagram, shared a speaker.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient share of revenues, so Facebook seems to invest such a step as a loan.
On Tuesday Facebook shared it would update his "money preference center" to have more control over the people about them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblocks would be worried about new filters because they would also block contents on the side that are not advertising.
"If users don't have a positive experience, so we plan to discuss the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an email communication.
Advertising blockers are a smooth means for us instead on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more controls into people's hands.
Women in Swiss's conscious suicide on cars
The victim was in the middle of the night on the train.
The police calls witnesses after a woman was passed in the early morning hours on Thursday at a convictional suicide of several vehicles on a car.
The incident was held on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt after midnight.
One woman put himself in the darkness "in an act of destruction" on the street and was taken by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss age of 49 years, who had been overlooked by several vehicles, including a car, would have been killed by himself.
She's still slow.
Many drivers have already been identified, but some have not yet been identified, the police asked them and all the Witnesses of the case to report.
There was an investigation procedure opening what is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared Le Tribune de Gene.
However, it remains expected if one of the drivers is shown.
Was it possible to avoid a convergence?
This is something that the lawyer must decide," said the Court.
Two similar cases are shown in the past five years that the drivers are not responsibilities.
In each of the two cases, in which one in the dark road delivered a person, was decided that the drivers do not need to get out of the football in the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released after she survived and killed a man who was a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been buried and became unconscious on the street, near the court.
The Court stated that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- was in a fair way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "excellent and unpredictable situation", said the Judge.
Each person who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should be reported at the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was one of the time available
The Venus, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, was probably a living one day.
Scientists at Goddard Institutes for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that differ from climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have found its hot, water-free surface and CO2-diving atmosphere.
Scientists previously indicated that Venus could be declared by its deep atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thick, desperate atmosphere and, however, slowly turned up.
The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more severe areas than the earth, but first had enough water and geographical variability to hide life and protect fast consumption.
The previous Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30% of the matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the long-term rotation of Venus exposes its day page of the sun almost two months ago," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press communication.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a swimming swimming swimming clouds, which works like a rain screen to decrease the surface of a large part of the sunwarm.
The results are average temperatures that are some degrees more cutter than the earth today.
The model showed a history of Venus, which distingues the Evolution, which was previously stimulated by planet researchers.
Although she was certainly habitable, the Venus was exhibited in the course of thousands of years -- too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were shocked and their water spring was burned from the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogens also remained a dick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a mortal trend effect -- the Venus, which we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as an avalanche trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche, and adopted a small co-determination law in the decision process of the team.
Alternative Chairman/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Agreement will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the past three years, I have filled my obligations as Chief Representative and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, suffering and certainty", said the 50-year-old Roy in a opinion.
In the summer's course, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more deep, that is necessary and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly agreed on the organization.
He must also have a co-determination law in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, the Roy, who was frozen on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was exhibited as a winner of Jack Adam's Award during his debut session at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best trainer of the liga.
He led the agreement on 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was shocked at the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesot and passed the sequence in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches marked a 39-39-4 mark in the season 2015-16 and returned five points behind the wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
As the Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northeasy oil workers have again discussed, strictered
The battle of work on the dislocation of North Sea-Ocean workers will be issued, while all the parties were put on the table for a new discussion round.
Streiks against the Oil Servicer Wood Group were spotically performed on platforms in the North Sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and RMT companies can confirm that we have joined us to start restarting the current struggle process", says a common statement.
We will hold some full-term meetings in the next weeks, which will start the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The workshops said that their last strike, which was the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible reward shortages from up to 30%.
Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea around 9% because of negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a decrease of 10% for Onshore lawyers in 2014.
The company said that additional rates to the company have the necessary space to come through the market decline.
She has left thousands of people and announced plans to give its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega collection with the British energy company BG.
Energy enterprises are under pressure because of the lowest oil prices, a economic situation that had been strengthened by the decision of the Britishs in June to leave the European Union.
The Scotia Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with employees in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest jobs that have been held since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few", he said in a statement.
2016 less than $1,4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison with a average of $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler missing rotation rate of stars in the purchase of the pearls
The latest mission with Kepler World Space Telescope has helped astronoms to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the shoes of the Mediterranean.
The new data helps the astronoms to understand why stars are switching on different ratios in stars and in which the rotation periods are linked to the increase in the planet.
"We hope we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its sun systems," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and analysis centre in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The sights of the Mediterranean is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star shop, which had occurred about 125 million years ago, now reach adults.
They're turning the fastest now.
To split rotation rates, these slightly swimming stars shock great amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnet fields of the stars, they have a blown effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate starts to delay.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between appearing a recognisable star fleet -- like sunfalls --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of slower pirates than smaller.
"The Ballet of the Mediterraneans we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, where faster rotors tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the stars are close to the pearls, it must be an ideal cosmic lab to compare star qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star buyers of the universe offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
It's still much before us about what we want to learn more about how the way, how the time and why stars slow their rotation rates and so assign their "shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their recent analysis of the rotation rates of the Astronomical Journal, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
An overwhelming baseball star is decreased
The clouds were faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Basseball Star in the best day of base to base.
After his emotional return advertisement, the 41-year-old Profi will take the Tricot of its New York Yankees on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' both," the 14-year-old All Star Game partner of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was chosen to be the most precious player of the Liga, he won with the Yankees World Series with the Yankees.
His subscription under a ten-year contract was estimated to him from 2007 to $27 million.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he functions as advisers and youth coach, in full content.
As player, Rodriguez paid long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees had created a few miles (a) stones since 2005.
With the Hall-of-Family members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players are shown in the most important statistics similar values.
However, the 41-year-old boys should not be included in the baseball hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so striking is his appearance outside the place.
In 2009, the superstar was able to take place with "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003 forbidden steroids.
In August 2013, it was disrupted by 211 parties because of a development in the so-called biogenis scandal.
Rodriguez is the principal suspect of receiving an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal stretch, the sperm has still been reduced to 162 meetings.
"The liga could have done me even a accident for 2014, because I have spent 20 years without pause", said Rodriguez then.
He also did not lose the day of his decision.
While many Baseball legends in their last games received the big shoes again, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank often.
"My job does not contain a decision-tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game", last Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to Cameron Diaz, has always been married to the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the player Kate Hudson, the sympathy opinions of the fans of Yankee-Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the adherents read at the 4-9-hisperation team against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian targetinski are the first doping accidents
Note: Because of a positive doping test, Adrian targetinski should not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are exceeded by the first official doping accidents.
A acquainted athline would have won almost a medaille.
Before the seventh Wednesday, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese Skimmer Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa, from Bulgaria and the Poland weighter Adrian targetinski, has been tested positively and excluded in Brazil - directly before the start of the lightthletic competition without critical distortion.
In Chen last Sunday, the diureticum hydrochlorothiazid was demonstrated as massing means for doping substances.
The International Sport Court CAS confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m smetterling, only about 0.09 seconds she passed the bronze medaille.
On Friday, Chen had to participate in the proposals over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested an opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the research", quoted by Xinhua: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of Justice of CAS and accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is not more the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of sportors with positive cases.
At the same time, in the night of Rio, the message about the positive tribe at Danekova, the 33-year-old boys went to the open.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV Sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only declaration could be food supplementary", explained the Leichtathletin.
According to the report, it should be the EPO of the prohibited substance.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the BT test should also be positively dismissed.
Bulgarian President Bojko Borissow, Minister of Ministers of the Athletics, urged to say the criticism.
"I don't understand why the sportors don't get the right closures," he said, "We're in Bulgaria under observance, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, almost all weight captains from the chronic doping nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian targetinski" was also known, the London Olympicist in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days ago on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both of the adoptions, however, should not begin in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the starting of the light-offs, the Danekowa case is a further severe shock for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had understood the complete Russian manity until an exception of the systemic dopings, also the implementation of Kenia has produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport, the previous conduct in China was also carried out between the athletes for strong interferences.
So the Francose Camille Lacourt took the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang hard.
"Sun the lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to send me", said Lacourt in the French radio.
Sun also was at the center of a interview with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for Doping shopers," said it.
Sun was tested positively at the Chinese masterships at the stimulans Trimetazidine, but only one three-month specimen was required.
Data key: so perfide printed hacker her loss
Programmers of Press-Malware are currently engaged in enterprises - and are successful.
According to a current survey of Malware-Specialist Malware Bays under 540 companies in North America, England and Germany, 40% of the undertakings in the last 12 months were at least once a number of victims of a attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, only 20% of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware press.
40% of the victims were willing to pay the losses requested by the murders in order to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The murders specialize their empressor software according to the observations of malware bytes, looking at attacks in company networks.
If it is successful, the potentially pressed loss payment is significantly higher than in private users.
"We currently observe a huge rapid evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with "the world".
The majority of Malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the murders discovered the expressing software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the changing to firm shops had been shocked in the past months.
Ransomware works after a simple template: once on the computer of a victim, it aims to search for long-term changed files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as the archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and remove the originals sustainablely.
Then the software presents the demands of the printer.
To get the finished encryption code to files, the victims need to send money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryption.
However, where private users are on the game, there is a sensible customer data or project database, without which the production rise.
Indeed, the damage is higher when a rail machine applies.
22% of the companies concerned reported the expenditure losses by Ransomware, 13% had to be completely interrupted with business activities, in a case of people in life.
In Germany a number of times of hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may have been affected by the loss of nurses.
"We always say the victims: not pay, you're only promoting the problem," said Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying their data again.
For the manager, it is difficult to dismiss the demand of the murders faced by a slow state in the exploitation.
The hackers know this again and try to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the security researchers of F-secure have studied the user surfaces and the contact with the printers and have come to the result: The killers really try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, provide free support websites to or decrypt examples of files.
And privacy will be solved after payments of few hundreds of euros, enterprises must so hardly be negotiated and pay fifth amounts to return their data uncrypted.
In view of the potentially higher and relatively riskless winnings from the ransomware press, the hacker will always be professional and shared with the work, explains the security experts Chester Wisniewski by the antivirus provider Sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about one week."
However, it is most likely to be three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software bag to the real printer.
The previous Malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $000 and $10,000.
"The delivery contains an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed", says Wisniewski.
Then the pushers are looking for further hackers to distribute the freely purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logged in one of the forums under the base, buy the seat of a criminal and uses another to install the software on the most possible PCs.
The payment is followed by infected computer.
"Besides, the crimes are involved, then spammer with dissemination," says Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is often known in many enterprises that make their data better safeguard.
More than 50% of the company-IT responsibilities in the malware bytes searching for raywares can be resolved using file backups and scanner software.
In this way, the murders are already undergoing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful recognition, the murders are threatened by the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is more than previously higher than the type of data.
The murders could also take fullly new goals in the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference of Defcon demonstrated security researchers, how they could have obtained a thermostat associated with the Internet.
Within the winter, the freetenance of such a blocked heat could be valued by some of the victims.
If the murders block an entire factory strategies instead of heating in the future, rainsomwares could also be a subject in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coup√© and also the diversity of a minivan.
It seems quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same platform as the new jazz, is actually flexible every day.
Although the HR-V is only smaller than 1.60 m higher, the passengers have a lot of places in the first line and the foundation, it does not work closely.
The materials of the internal space are well processed and affected, only the cockpit surface depends on something.
More than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the stairway.
It is not only available for a copper room of 453 l at higher levels and 1026 l in rounded back rounds, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the surfaces of the backbank can be shocked like kinossel and offer steady that is up to 1,140 m from the ground to the board.
The shopping room can be good, but the load height of 650 mm is something higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-cell with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V from up to 300 Nm in weighing road number ranges very powerful.
But he would do something less.
Happy is the consumption of 4.7 l/100 km daily.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
It's not offered for a all-ray drive.
The conduct of driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But it should be a little more direct.
The equipment can not open desires in the tested top variant "Executive".
The City Notbrem Assistant (hereinafter 32), the Collision Warning System and the Spurware Assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because it evaluates many obstacles to the ring as "facing objects".
Very reliable the television assistant works.
And the intelligent timer reacts to transport marks and drys the speed when needed.
The full connection is only for the top location: 7-Zoll toyscreen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI browser are under the arms and are therefore getting something outstanding.
The EUR 29000 for the good equipped top is okay.
Those who do not want to invest such a lot receive the benzine from EUR 20000, which is from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a wide and daily car.
Airline not captured: Storage on flight bridges
A airline does not arrest a passenger on the flight bridge.
Because a detention is only possible for risks that are typically for air traffic, the Supreme Court of D√ºsseldorf argued (Ac. 18 U.124/14).
The shooter had shocked a shooter at the shooting.
However, the accident could happen overall - it is a general risk of life, so the court.
The aircraft did not have to pay the man a damage.
Diseases: When the events pay
Hospital holidays will only be returned after their travel when the cause of disease is uncertainly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was difficult for disasters and crimes on the second day of its Turkish permission.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
The vacants returned to a defective condition that seemed to have polluted the sea water.
The family was the view that the journey was missing - and complained against the event.
The applicants did not have success before the court.
Even though the cluster was defected in fact.
But the event was just a short time before the applicants were dismissed from it.
He had to get out of it that the sea water was okay.
He therefore did not harm his information obligations, so the judgment.
There were no pollutions found in the samples of the water once.
The disease of several hotel guests - possible by packing between - listen to the general life risk.
From 691 guests only 38 were sick.
The Maizi√®re said that after the acts of violence prohibited by refugees in Wurzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State should be shocked and decided to react in terrorism.
Indeed, our country will not answer the violence of the murders with hate and disappointment.
This triumph, we're not gonna give the terrorists.
If criminals should leave the country more quickly, it increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy.
The Maizi√®re wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals to the Federal Day of 2017.
He also announced a further staff strengthening the security forces, namely ‚Äúin a mid-fourth dimensional order over a few years‚Äù.
Sympathy for terrorism must be sentenced again.
Video monitoring is intended to improve the weapons law so newly, especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet.
The last many discussed urgency for doctors is to be maintained according to the Maizi√®re's words.
However, he wants to find solutions in the dialogue with the doctors, how the risk of citizens can be reduced, said, with regard to psychological emergency.
In order to enhance the radialization of refugees, the Minister is in need of better social care.
Learning forces should be better prepared for the treatment of traumated people.
For the persecution of crimes in specific areas of the Internet (Durknet), the Maizi√®re places the use of declared investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved in increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of Internal Affairs have expressed a clear opposition against actionism.
"This was an earnest for the sharpmakers in the CDO/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Freeday).
The Maizi√®re had previously rejected the vow from the Union following a Burka prohibition and the abrogation of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-releasing was a problem for constitutional law.
You can't prohibit everything you're rejecting, and I'm deniing the tragedy of the Burka.
Regarding rules, you can talk about the rule or for the witnesses.
Green Chief Simone Peter was proposed to simulate the minister with the always new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Spruchs and a strengthening of the residence rights do not bring people to security in this country."
Advanced transport flow on the car tower
It is regularly on the environmental strategy - this is a picture of November.
However, this should be changed: the law enforcement should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers that are located on the circle road every night when they walk through the cars to bridge (A 43).
The country's construction of road construction is extended on Thursday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Street, the law endorsed at 700 meters (700 m).
The car drivers can shoot right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: the transport is prematurely shared, improved by the total end of the overall section of the Federal Strategy 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDF in the district of Munster West.
The train drive on the train driver is mainly nervous between 17 and 19.00 p.m.
Workdays the backup is enough to bridge over the alberslope and sometimes out of it.
It is reasonable for the Nade resort on the B 51 short before the Weseler Street.
From here, the transport is only slightly flowing through the car bridges.
The second scene had to be rebuild for a goodty-first years ago.
The reason: Statistical calculations had shown that the bridges did not have the necessary trag force to cover, in particular, the loading.
As long as this engpass and the related working steel will be duly, the competent country business cannot say.
However, with years to recognise, because the bridge has an official use of the remaining period up to 2034.
For the prorogation of the law enforcement, the country industry has consciously requested the trafficking time in the schools because it was to be recognised with disabilities.
The transport shall be carried out on Thursday and Wednesday at the building.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre room "The invisible house".
The Nima's Unit and the boy theatre are planning a music project now.
The Nima's Convention allows youths to visit the Migration and Refugees to visit cultural institutions in Munster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School of Children has visited a view of the priced "The invisible house" of the boy Theater Munster.
In the context of the "intercultural travel" initiated by the Nima's Unit, 19 students visited the insertion in the small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the Agreement offered the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interface has aimed at visiting schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in Munster.
The majority of the classs came from September 2015 to March 2016, among others from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to M√ºnster, and little disappeared in German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scene images and video animations could have been possible to follow the event of conduct, so the press communication of the boy Theater Munster.
The Nima's Unit, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theatre will work in the next game time in a music theater project.
From October to December youths will receive the possibility of visiting professionally dedicated courses in the fields of sing, dance, shock and music with and without relief and migration.
Provisions for children and families in the field of the theatre game and theatrale communication are in the planning.
The "Interculture travel" project continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the agreement with many classes wanting to participate.
Sleeves instead of stars: hope of weather deterioration
The weather has made the star shoes in the south-west Germany in the night a strike through the account - but there is still hope.
The night was badly able to observe the sky spectacle because of wool and rain, said the Chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will see many stars on the sky.
The star shoes are Perseads, which belong to the fastest shoes of 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come out of the star image Perseus that appears in the Northern.
Small night: Tips against sleep disorders
Tonight, if you're going to be eternity, you'll be waking for a midday night, and you're not going to think about sleeping in the morning before the shopping kids.
It's all different than it's repeated.
There is always such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a fourth of adult sleep disappearances and more than ten percent of their sleep is often or permanently repeated.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders feel?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes based on them, highlights Hans-Gues, member of German society for sleeping and sleeping medicine.
What you understand, but the insomnia is, therefore, an insomnia and sleep disruption.
While the sleeping is inadequate or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German household association with practice in the Netherlands.
What's going on behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
In this case, organic, psychological or conductive factors can be covered, but also medicational.
Not rare is sleeping expression of another disease.
"True early wave is especially often at a depression," said Weesch.
And it may be that different factors are different.
For instance, the one who has a band shock may be bad, waits every two-third hours and starts to swim over every day problems and - sorgen, there is an example.
This leads to adjustment, and sleep is not possible.
When should you have sleep disorders to your doctor?
Whoever not sleeps well over a month in at least three nights per week and is affected on the day should go to the doctor, hey.
The inclination can look very different: it is cut, laughed, unsoned, has difficulties with attention and concentration, it is easy to relieve, has stimulation changes or physical complaints such as magic or head pain.
It is important to find out the causes of sleeping.
The treatment options, among other behavioral changes, a cognitive behavior treatment or even medically - classic sleep tablets are questioned only in exceptional cases and at least for two weeks.
In Germany, there are little sleep medicines, and Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping center of the Charity University Medicine Berlin.
It is why we should first go to the home physician when sleeping problems.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the bed laboratory, and what's going on?
For research in the sleep laboratory, for example, in snacks with athemaus seeds, in sickness of day, in sleeping channels, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disorder, fietze.
Preparing for the investigation is not necessary.
You should get the day normal.
"No, please don't sleep at midday," says Fietze.
After the castle, you're going to bed at its normal time.
Besides the electrics in the body, you're taking a nase brill, a brown and a powder on the finger.
Moreover, a camera on the board is playing the sleeping.
How can the interested people get the problems in the griff?
There are a lot of shoes in which you can be able to make a better sleep.
It includes: Regular sleeping and retreat times, not being too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not look close to sleep, spend alcohol, and not watching at night at the watch - then then you start to recall immediately, and that's all and not even promoting.
What is the dschungel camp with lacking medailles in the sweet
The former German summer Markus Debiler has been expressed by Facebook for the delay of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had helped at the short-term Railway Meeting in Doha first time and also set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV atlet Markus Deabler has protected his former team collections in the criticism.
"In a country where a olympiageist has a premium of $20,000, and a squirty king of 150,000‚Ç¨ should not be wondered about missing medals," the 26-year-old boys on his Facebook page wrote on Friday.
The promoting system in the swimming port is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot competite with countries that promote very much and doping is not so precise or even acting on the subject.
"I don't say that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he starts a competitor, Debiler should be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is how we should keep it with countries.
"If a certain time before WM/OS may not be controlled by WADA/FINA independent controllers, it is not possible to participate", the election-Hamburger calls for a iron diet in the middle of the year.
Airport: bands of bags
Professional Diebe at the airport D√ºsseldorf
On Thursday, two women and two men in the age of 50 to 61 years of age were civil servants of the D√ºsseldorfer police.
The defenders had started as bands a number of tasting and packaging storms.
At 21.30 p.m. civilian officials were renowned by a band known by the police from the past slaughter crimes.
The two women and two men have started a number of crimes since the mid-July this year, and there was a community, working and specially professional.
The criminal committee's specialists 34 may prove four acts to be taken by the committee of crimes to Germany.
They were totally advised by EUR 15,000.
Altbauers, a few line trees, between the rest of a stone floor: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act on the first sight, but the police is part of the "safe places" of the city.
When you go the street from East to West, you go to game places, a fried child garden and a biolade.
At the fassade of a grain house, somebody said "high!".
With regard to a member that will also be deleted soon, it will be built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new accommodations.
Articles about this "treatment part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, designed with brushing cars in the last few weeks.
It is reasonable for the house with number 94: At first it was placed, mostly the people have contracts, however, there are still rooms in the earthquake and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin Entersensor Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard step in the police against the project, named "No-Go-Zone" for police police and the 94.
On June 22, the rooms in the earthquake, the castle ships, with 300 police officials, patrolized the police three weeks of official appeal, with 30 to 40 employees and three cars on the ground, cut parts of the road and took visitors to attend the house with number 94.
During the time, renewed construction workers as part of the unknown householders are the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the residence was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went to the Jubel of Sympathists and inhabitants.
On this summer Sunday, the street is peacefully active: parents go to space with children, people sit on the citizen shift before the houses in the sun, others maintain a late form.
In the immediate proximity of the house projects, a basic school and child farms are available.
Left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants: Kerstin Newbauers, who have lived since 1999 in Kiez, and Jana*, who are here larger, are particularly covered by the police presentation.
They share the concerns of increased wages and genderization with the inhabitants of the household projects.
It doesn't sound after a kies, which mostly desires the police protection before the slaughtering links.
The grain that the Berlin inner senator and the police between householders and their neighbors are obviously not present.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was a traditional workshop that also has a lower average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
The households and the household projects that were born are already in Kiez for a long time: 1990 many houses were placed in the former DDR, including the whole mainway near the Riga.
While the maintainer was slaughtered in a regular street slaughter, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had been employed 26 years ago.
At the same time, in the last few years, the city has become more Magnetes for Tourists and Electoral Berliners from all the world: there are now populations from DDRs and former householders.
This is also noted in the currency that has been increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in renewales.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised by cuts or friedly stripped fassades that were covered with color balls.
No other streets were mentioned this year so often with the words "links autonomy violence".
A reason why not all neighbors consider this as a problem could be that they are not unlikely affected by criminality: crimes such as corporate infringement are almost exclusively against police.
The largest part of the crimes depends on damages that tendenciously meet the reconstrued and fresh renewed houses.
For Kerstin new constructioners who have been living in a house in a 17 years next to the surrounded 94 may not be a talk of insecurity.
As regards violence, the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been determined.
Also, the famous brushing cars don't give it directly in the Rigare for a long time.
For the studied architects, it is not a criminal burning point, instead: "Here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than any other."
New buildings have been cut into the Riga Street - and remained.
That was why she was so important that the people returned to their road: from police, policy and media, which recently demanded all the Germanity over the city in July.
However, in the eyes of the inhabitants as new buildings, the street is continued to remove them: through visionless reconstructors in former buildings that disappear the old habitants.
"This are finally property accommodations that are not interested for many here - more people living here that aren't so well", they say.
"Government and destruction, I can't absolutely be good. "
But what should you do if someone never listens to?
It's putting on all sides, also at the police and the inhabitants.
For additives who were hungry over color bombs, Kerstin Newbauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes belonged to Kiez.
This should be aware of it - just like someone who stands in a kidnapper, can smell over the laugh.
All persons presented with sub-names have requested not to be called with their right name
Urbach: Anniika Godchle is a new refugee deputy
Annika Godchle is the partner in matters of integration and organization.
In addition, she is a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Godchle is the Refugee Officer for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogic supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.
It seems to be a partner for all actors: refugees, workshops, refugee aid, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Customs of the working circle states that the honoraries are more than thankable that God's cloud is now, the evil milk, which is especially a problem.
Thus, some -- less slower than the number of task areas were commonly, as the management wanted to describe the office.
An administrative power has been requested with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-year experience in social work, or a pleasant milk milk.
But administrative work is not her central area, I mean Annika Godchle.
In particular, it is about the organization, work with people in place and behind the cultures and network activities.
The 31-year-old has been around six weeks.
She has spent a 50 per cent stage for three years.
"It was the highest time," Regine Customer says that Annika Godchles supported honor and primary actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Shortly new containers are located in the wash road
There is a serious problem since some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been acknowledged.
The communities are responsible for the connection submission.
They must enter the refugees into their own or adjacent housing spaces.
The costs for the construction, the currency or the renewal of these accommodations must take the communities itself.
The responsibility changes from the Country Board to Communs and Workcenters.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every income wants to offer its apartment.
The search is very difficult since some time.
In fact, the management does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, if you are ordered to private housing, so God‚Äôs crowd.
Therefore, communal apartments must be equipped as it is so nice.
So soon new containers will be placed in the wash road.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the sign, the Regine clients and Annika Godchle are agreed.
Besides a fixed stay, there are practical places, training facilities, school places, euro works and help activities for refugees and migrants who must be found or established.
"More plans would be good", says Regine Client.
Many work in the building court or help homemasters, complete common work - and it motivates and very ordinary as Annika Godchle reports.
It hopes that the work for the Commonwealth leads to a positive external impact.
That's "no job therapy".
But the activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a firm structure, say God's clouds and customers.
People should develop a sense of persistence.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with local and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So switch the administration and honor officials here too.
It is central that the refugees are feeling that they wished and welcomed in Germany.
The long time of the procedure is a problem.
They need to explain the refugees that it is the same time and they can fully overcome the time, for example, with speech courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he cannot help anyone in the urban city, should not work and be unnecessary, who will never be integrated.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are problems, however, are also, honestly said customers, "Leaves where there is nothing." The work of God's spirit and customers is therefore always motivating others.
It's all a "Mammut motion."
A difficult question: Do the two are fearing of radialization in a small community such as urban?
"No," Regine Customer says very clearly, "what some may call naive." A restriction can be made, but they don't want to exclude.
The helper's being sensitive.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the murders were completely invoked.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do", says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
As a result, primary and honor officials must be viewed in the region and in the region.
In this way, they always have the background that soon a new stage of refugees and immigrants could come to the city.
Germany needs an overwhelming level?
This question is clearly answering the policy.
Indeed, it is unfair to help them in place.
"In the city, we're not here where we want to go," says Annika Godchle.
No new refugees, which would relax the situation.
Regine Clients also clearly shows that the urbans have already been loaded to integrate consciously the people before.
These are now about 100 people, most young men.
But if people are in need, they should be helped, both women are agreed.
The political situation is so complex, there is no simple answers.
