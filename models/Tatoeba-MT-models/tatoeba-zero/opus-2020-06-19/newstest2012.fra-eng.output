Parliament has not ratified the Amendment for Tymosenko's Liberation
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft cancellation of the paragraph relating to the inculpation of Julia Tymosenko, the Chief of the Opposition.
Deputy refused in second reading the draft amendment for the reduction of punishment for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years of prison for having concluded an unsuccessful agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The court is not definitive and the court must act on the appointment of the sentence in December.
Tymosenko qualified the rule of political vengeance and has caused a trial's partiality-approval process in the West.
The draft to cancelle paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have been 226 votes for approval.
libyenne winner
Liberation or rebellion Libyan has already settled.
Muammar Kaddafi is entered in a unknown place in the wilderness, and without him war has been finished.
It's still to determine the winners.
As it is cotume in the region, election winners are Islamics, but it is moderate or radicular.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the ordinary law of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because a flight is cut off.
Women can forget emancipation, the unrespectable events of their faith are passive of capital punishment...
This is the Coran who will join the place of the dictator's personality the company composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya, it will rule a order as we cannot represent it and how we would certainly do not.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprised that Islamic warriors accepted the aid with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who directed the NATO's shock, but instead God whose size they celebrated at each attack.
So when it is to search for winners in Libya, the western is not part of it
We participated in tits, servicing Islam and our polytics have been distracted from the dictator as a political alliance without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly occupied by Libya.
So there is no problem for locals to cut off "created".
Is that without soil occupation, oil companies will easily be accessed to black Libyan gold.
It may not, and the Western will finally be able to avoid a decent protection of human rights.
For little, we prevent these chair adeptes.
A new crisis era begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the vision of investors.
A tour of statistics has passed on Monday in Europe.
Each of the states published the reliable information to the GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has been the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The compulsory market covers all records.
Investors do not only look to Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and other.
The Euro Area Statistics Bureaus, Germany, Czech and other countries of Europe quickly published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has an expected growth of 0.5%, which is 0.4% of France.
The two countries have changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better referred to as expected (0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent), however, France made a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the question was to the origin of stagnation).
Czech economy has grown by 1.5% during the third quarter.
However, the GDP has been staged and, according to the Czech Statistics Bureau, it is confirmed that it is directed to a progressive reduction in economic growth.
The results are worse than analyst previsions.
The most important events:
Czech economy has grown by 1,5% during the third quarter, but has been stagnated during the last quarter.
Germany's economy has increased 0.5% in the third quarter according to the data planned and periodically revised.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union has increased 0.2% between July and September in comparison to the previous quarter, as the analysts were expected.
The Greek economy has decreased 5.2%.
10-year-old income is 28.45%
The results of the obligations of Spain and Italy are in sight to critical limits.
Problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The income of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent while the situation is in the region.
The ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs were qualified for the EURO.
They winned in Montenegro 1:0 and feed the qualification for 200 million
The football representation succeeded its harder mission in the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the Super Cech and Garden Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football was lovingly defended with a good part of chance in the second part of its qualification and would not miss Europe's championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reporting.
No special excitation during the first part and a great part of chance for the second.
The Czech Representation also won by the super Cech and the Hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for Europe's Championship.
Montegrains were found under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The winners of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who sweared two opportunities to mark a goal.
And thanks to the Super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be excluded to the Championship of Europe in the next year, and also a reward of 200 million corones in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a warball.
The two teams were difficult to get combinations, and the game was mainly focused around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers has not occurred in the Czech Defense that has responded exactly to long tits even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human bouclier
Several hundreds of high school students have created a human bouclier around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country towards a possible Israeli shock.
Students began to pray at midday before the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
Several hundreds of students from Spain's universities have created a mardi human bouclier around the island's nuclear technological center where the uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country in danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its last information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
In Israel, a possible attack of Iranian nuclear institutions is taken.
Students began to pray at midday before the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where the uranium is broken.
Food of a child obtained: Do not take a small dinner and take the charcuter for dinner
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 years of age have superpoid problems, 9 per cent of schools have a weight above the average and 5 per cent are obtained.
As the current research shows, obedient children originate from families who have a malicious life style.
This reiterates the importance of the environment in which the human being and the models that it turn.
For example, in the tables of obsessed children, 50 per cent is more often found than in children ' s families at normal weight.
19% of the obsess had frozen dinner according to the investigation conducted with awareness action "Observance is not a accident"
In the largest families, sport is not also a custom, which is now the case of most of today's schools - only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents found the time for the active movement.
Inquisition under 900 children
The survey has been conducted during the last school year and participated in 900 primary schools in Czech.
It was the second edition of "Observity is not a chair", action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from six to the third have been registered to this project.
One of the determinant factors that cause dramatic increase in the number of superpower children, or obsessed, is the absence, a correct and not enough physical exercise.
"For example, only half of the children asked to eat 5 times per day - dinner - dinner - a dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," states one of the results of the investigation.
No small dinner and charcuter at dinner
Specialists focused on the fact that for healthy development, there are some basic details such as a small family dinner at the same time.
In Czech only 23% of student families eat at my same time.
In the largest part of the family each one takes his small dinner alone.
And the worst that has been said is that a tenth of the population does not take a very small dinner.
However, the small dinner is the basis of a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the familys of obedient children, there are more use of malnutrition.
Almost each student - without talking about weight - drink every day of sugar drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children concerned are regularly sports but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the investigation allowed children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities proposed according to their own guest and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czechian children from 12 to 15 years are far away, at a healthy food, of the ideal."
Among their favorite plates there are many guests, meat and sucres.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a large preference for sugar limonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For dinner, these are the skins that took the first place just before the white meat.
Children do not want feculents and preference for fish and vegetables was very low.
Healing on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their customs from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of control of a group of participants to the investigation that had filled the questionnaire after the sensibilisation meeting "Observance is not an accident", the results of the investigation were set out in a well-determined will to lead to a healthy food.
For example, the most marked was for sugar limonates since children began to give consumer water preference.
Childs were most often covered on the questionnaire of white meat and fish as the main plate and would reduce the sugar plates and the "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread balls or land poms).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In an article of presentation on how to learn for the stylists, I have put a little angry of the fact that there was a lot since the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The exhibition of three professionals of speciality, personal housing and a seminar on what happens.
And that'll be worse.
We draw closer to final reviews and wait for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses of the same day and Sunday is really "boured".
This time we treated with the Alenka Director (only there is no boy) in order to strike the woman who has no standard mention.
And women of this kind is most.
One has a little sweet, the other one is a boy's body, without special curve, one of the superpoids.
The stylist must know how to optically accumulate large arms, extend a cup or well add the necessary curves.
We have so come to sweetly emphasize personality, and also not too sighting ways of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong sweet and pronounced shoes and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the shoes in such a way as the shoes or pants do not pass out of all, the shock is to do it in measure.
And you will not regret it because the swimming swimming smell is inevitable.
In a measured jump you'll feel much better than in the swimming swimming, swimming and not holding the ceinture and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, Tucker style can be enabled, with coated tissue pieces, or even broders.
Of course, there are many examples of different appearances and I am glad I have the whole week to take all the information received.
But I'm also afraid I had to do what I have to do at home too much.
Each stage was received a celebration for the day and evening.
We need to take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "hail" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know about the Victorian Secret.
I am pleased, because it's better than living Brinny Spears, Christina Aguilera, who took about 100 kilometres of these last days (not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and cover from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
It is also important to reflect on the graphic part of the styling.
The styleist does not only have the physical but also creates the productive pages in the magazines (for example, the trends for hands, mantels, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a styleist and graphist, has maintained us all of this.
But this... until Sunday.
The styleist must have a general vision
Three specialist visits gave a variety of aspects to the Sabbath Meeting of information on the various types of persons.
Honza Pokorny, stylelist, Jakub Polanka mode graphist and Ben Renc, mode photo.
Jakub recalled us that mode is a illusion and the styleist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with a single habilement in a different way.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this tritch-coat that must be taken classically with a jean and a t-shirt as a light shirt, but it can also have the nucleus body, with scarpins and take it in photo as a rob.
Or it's enough to remove the skins or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Joy with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following counsel: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You could then start to contravene there," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with what, why, when in the mode magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on mode delays.
I know again, thanks to the Ben-Mode photo that the styleist must have much more housing variant than those that are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that will have a ten of pages (of a ten of models) I must be ready to "retail" at least one hour.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear totally different than in reality.
We need to take into account this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes the half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It is enough to look at Madonna, which is not a super cloud, but its image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czech, the approach to the use of the stylist services remains still fresh.
And acquaintances sometimes considered them unnecessary (that I know something but what I'm going to pass at the second rank).
And if someone makes himself a styling of our side, we should then tell us with a great probability a completely different size (ther smaller) than what he actually has.
We still have to navigate on a google and to ensure if the bolevard information makes the event of the questionnaire, if it has maygri or big, etc.
Honza and Mario put us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough to stand in the mode and to assemble models.
It must communicate with people who he is, and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
If you have become people, don't flee, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to take him his army and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything and say to him, My God what horrible."
"You'll find some business you'll find pleasant and you will consult with what to take them," said Mario.
This showed us concretely what should contain everything that the "placovka" or "stylist" is called.
It's the one you're cut around the size and you're on yourself for everything you need.
Besides the clearly defined things such as skins, depiling rolls or even even the sleeves, it is also found from the nillons fil (which the stylist uses for photographing products such as shoes, or heads), special clips with which one clothes are closed in the dust, if it is too large (the epingle or other type of agraph is not useful because they could be clothing) or a sweet kitchen.
So we were not only people who listen, but who have tried something practically, they taught us how to look like shoes correctly.
And during the photo meeting in the kitchen where the surface is equal, the seed could, at a fortiori outside.
And that's how we colled and collapsed.
We do not have the right to touch the skins so that we don't hurt by inadvertence.
There is, therefore, a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he welcomed me for my creation.
The account I've made is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I'm going to get more understanding that doing styling a professional is not a walking in a rose garden, that everyone tells what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is discussed throughout America.
Revision
As a result, an unfair course is transformed because of a set of stupid errors of persons who have nothing to do in a routine routine movement to work.
This is up to a certain measure the ambition of everyone but it will not serve to anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitle The Run has produced great expectations before his outcome.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed series already old and out of a type of game from playable parties that would not only be accounted for points.
So we were curious how to be the pleasing passages during which the main hero sorts of his car and do what he lived.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what was expected.
It is potentially arcade course games, but the whole shoot to the bottom because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for a few years.
It isn't really errors, but instead the expression of incomprehensible fainence from the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure with the main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to resolve them to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the flight on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is coming first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
Itinérary is divided in ten steps and then in more than 50 courses.
As a result, each course is done on a different item and steps planned in different environments, which are sufficiently different from each other and are interesting.
The player has no feeling only a moment when the game offers something identical to it.
Some environments are pretty nice even though the graphic level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, this isn't the world's way.
But the driving through the desert, in automing landscapes or in high-bearmed mountains is very pleasantly.
The tests are in more than time in a time permitted by a typical element.
For example, in the desert you find in a swimming tempte that reduces visibility in a sensible way.
Then, in the mountains, you must take attention to the fact that an avalanche does not go above you.
Besides that, the different courses are well organised the ones behind the other.
There's only a small number but it's enough.
There are moments to overcome the number of opposers requested (such as in a classic course) then you will run against the clock (the classic with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opposite.
Sometimes you have the police who enters the game and try to make you the difficult situation.
The newness is the passengers outside the vehicle.
This is instead an interactive animation when most of the time Jack is shooting before someone and you have to help it by meeting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (for being real there are only three).
As a result, this is well as because this element is not risked to generate and place in the context described above in elements that accept the game.
The conduct model is in the tradition of the previous games.
That means that there is no extraordinary thing today but it is not possible to say that it is negative.
For real simulation, you must go to see another.
But even though it can be better found in the concurrence the conduct model is very well with the type of course design.
So everything's okay.
The problems start to appear after a certain time.
With the difference in the conduct model, the collisions is not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game a complicated deformation and collision, but when you don't have, at a collision with any object, the less idea of how your car is conducted, it's therefore not completely good.
During the slaughtered overshoots you're touching a few times slightly, but otherwise your car is part of folks.
Or it's in midsts.
Thanks to the restart system This is not really a problem, but it really does you.
The restart is made so that when you've dropped the figure or you've been out in the decort the game brings you at the last point on the entry.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game since the beginning.
So it's more tool, for the case where something doesn't happen as it's necessary, that's something about which you really can account.
Sometimes the restarts do not help, and the solution should be found by memorying the piece of the questionnaire.
The big here of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some girls who have to be passed in a certain way, unless this isn't happening.
Otherwise, you meet a place given by "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in the late.
What is angry is the situations when you see easily crossing the adverse between two cars that come in contrary sense and when you arrive, you have to go to the side and spend them or swallow them well.
It's equal if you go before him because it's "called" in such a way as for the given situation it always arrives near your neck.
The opposites still have other benefits.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worry about time, and you have always the same opposite that you are before at the same place.
This exercises the most end of game when you run on a long bridge in inverse sense.
The opposite must pass at any price before you.
When it passes before you, it hides the view of other vehicles inversely and comes in collision a lot of times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivant and full of adredaline, but it's clear that you're shocking quickly.
And it's harmful because through a simple conduct model the game is interesting and the places with so many action you don't have time to follow everything happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique items, that the course order is like there's no chance to cut off or something else.
The original idea is the changing of cars during the course.
You must take care of the essence pomps on the shopping because you can change it in the car, however, most of the time you have enough.
Autos are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for the cities, the large American cylinders for the right authors and the super sport cars to exotic rounds on very technical drives, for example on the mountains' roads.
And the challenge mode, which are courses in particular places you know about adventure, is very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects are starting out:
This is online connected with the Autolog function, which, among others, compares your results achieved with the other players and offers other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult cuts to understand is the situation of the last aventure course.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (that is like) where you run in the darkness on the road (that is like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (oriented) and behind you is a metro line that sends you the car directly to the helmet.
We had a debate for a few days to know if someone really thought about the creation of this game or even if the authors really take us for wicked ones.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
In extreme situations, the image does not hold the level and in some cases tragicly.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image does not serve you anymore.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In order to enjoy the largest number and especially the youngest public, a new sound track has been created in the style "I melange everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game hadn't had these stupid errors, we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in the past few years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The amusement is really well, but prepare for your faults to throw you in the eyes with the strength of a aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassadrice near the European Union:
Czechs are negative and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically eliminated the balance between institutions"
"I didn't wait for a so hard war."
"This will take 5,6 years before the situation is calm and all players have their new role", so Milena Vicenova began its exposure to the Czech Ambassademic near the European Union.
When she successfully described the various EU organs and their relationships so comprehensive and visible, as a large number of conferences of the University of Charles's Right Faculty could send it, she showed how serious it takes its word "comprehensible and openly" towards Europe.
Ms. Vicenova has joined her work by Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"After the beginning, the critics he was facing, that it's a round-de-cuir, that he can't fill any mission and I have to say he cut the souffle to all the people because he played his role in perfectity."
"He is a man who knows listening to 27 Member States, while communicating with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the Defence Policy in the context of a response to the question: "Who is the European Union?" "Who is the phone number I have to call?", therefore, as an important step towards the university and a greater liability towards the Union's State policy, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (coat smell that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also reported the agenda that he lived, lived and lives near the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
Czech Republic has resolved the amount of financial crisis, gas crisis or well organized a Summit for a Eastern Partnership.
She qualified the fall of the shooting of very negatively and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation to the EU is now very busy.
According to Madam's words, "the activity struggled its full" not only for the Presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved yet now.
The new Union's seventh budget must be adopted, which becomes very complicated as a result of the current economic situation.
As the budget seems to be mixed and in terms of economies, which priority will be given, at least those countries will be helped in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassadrice recalled his slogans with whom she came to Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe."
"I really don't like abreviations, foreign words, the gardens that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it's true that no one do round or tordues in Brussels, bananas are differently large or no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to use the EU environment better and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A Europe on several speeds is waiting for us
According to the Ambassaded, the Czech Republic has the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect than positively.
It is also regrettable to see such a small Czech representation in European institutions.
The fault results, according to it, of several factors, such as the fear of our candidates, their incapacity to write a motivation letter and a low support of the Czech part.
Another Czech Presidency then stressed the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Cree me, when you come to me the Poland, the Magyar, the Slovakia, the Frenchist said to me, "Hey, what are you doing there, that you still do this group of Visegrad?" and it is not all content."
According to Madam Vicenova, in a future nearby there are new hard rules on budgetary policy which are expected to Member States.
It is the concept of a Europe to two speeds, if it's several speeds, which prevails instead of a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside the area."
"We have the Schengen space, we also have the strengthened institution of cooperation."
First of all, he was said that they cooperate among them the countries who want him and those who do not want him remain in their rank."
"They will have many institutions of this type and there will be a Europe really to two speeds," said Mrs. Vicenova.
It also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basiss that all the topics affected the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
IBM innovator starts in the second century of its existence
If someone had to search for the vocabulary that expresss most near the IBM strategy, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of technological revolution, it is a strong feeling as very current, but since his creation has been a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was drawn by the first chief of the firm, the Visual Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of world problems can be resolved so that people are desirable to reflect.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the press around which life will be developed (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the care company developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continued movements towards the future.
IBM has survived hundred years because it remains always loyal to its basic values, and it has not been afraid to change all the other around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we will reach further" was deleted for the anniversary of the current director of firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the 30s, began to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the only IBM employees were the first employees to have the vacance paid, an insurance paid by the employee more a elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed relationship system.
The society was generous in the discovery of talents, as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman- Virginia Romatty, which should replace Palmisano to the head of IBM.
This works at IBM for 30 years and is currently employed by Head of the Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has done what is called hamy, online brain storming, from which many future strategies and innovations are made.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are about 500000 people working.
A institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company which ensures a safe position in business areas.
"After the IBM's beginning had a concept of institution than a strong technological", Rosabeth Moss Kanter said, Economy Professor at the Harvard Economic School and author of the IBM book.
"IBM is not a strong technological but a strong helping to solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony from the strong Consultating Forrester Research.
As it said, there is a difference in entering the market and establishing this market.
IBM - or "Blue Great", as it is familyly called in the United States with regard to its slogan - in hundreds of years, has grown up to become one of the world's most strongest firms.
Of course, it is the strongest polyvalent technological - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, hosting, services of the server to nanotechnologie.
It has many patents from all the american fixed technologicals and five of its employees received a Nobel price.
For example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disc.
This year, IBM was recovered with $220 billion the second most strongest technological in terms of market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it was the first time that exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
These are not all innovations and manufactures that have prefered customers and time - for example IBM did not have the same effect on a own OS/2 operational system, the online service Prodiger or both the IBM PCjr computer:
"After your business is built on the advanced move, you can't emotionally remain increased on the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work.
For example, the Microsoft Concumer who holds on the base and remains under the Windows operational system.
A technological perspective
In IBM income, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a preferential place.
However, in 1990 she was with the most strongest hardware membership motivation.
Since the year 2000, IBM sold low income for $15 billion, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues in investments and even since 2008, when the new financial crisis was overcome for the first time.
IBM negotiates according to the preceptes of his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, which also increased its volume of investment during the great economic crisis.
Is it now apparent that IBM has passed the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action has been projected from 2008 by 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the steady continued to grow.
The logo of solid IBM is to change but not its values.
For this reason, this flexible matrix of other crisis can be expected.
IBM history: From shoes to flights in the cosmos.
IBM company (International Business Machines) was born 100 years ago in New York; she was initially the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a firm succursale in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the fusion of four solids whose history is linked to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the old "points", the pendules that recorded the arrival and the department of employees.
The new company's architect was Charles Ranlett Flint who had presidened the Society's Surveillance Board until 1930.
Flint bought the chief of a firm competitor Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is about Watson's ideas that up to now the identity and culture of society.
Watson's leading to the firm shock in 1952.
IBM, as he says, starts with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - the tranching of fat and meat until the registered castles.
During the first four years in which Watson was directed, the business rate was multiplied until up to $9 million and starts the firm expansion in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so unreplaced that after 40 years of direction is his son who takes the director's fault, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM, the development of artificial intellectuality and the first programing language is developed.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classical PC that determines the time computer standard with IBM 5150 arrives on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchase the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to take advice and services with a high value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept "a more intelligent planet".
Its objective is the intelligent illusion of technology in non-operated areas, such as the transport and the management of towns.
For the field of IBM trade, a "Smarter Trade" platform that helps trade managers all the commercial cycle short time ago.
IBM has a strong story also on our territory.
It created its succursale in Czechslovakia in 1932 then the first central and Eastern countries.
Today, more than IBM RT, there is also the Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central and Eastern Europe Seats in Prague, and there is also the world's research and development team that concerns the recognition of the words.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
If you can keep that ain't, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's done!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years of age) became a body guard and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina would still hope that Joseph wake up his rose dream and return to his home.
Only it could not wait and has established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova was asylum in Bartosova in her home, she didn't swear that her couple wouldn't hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move from Ricany, Pepa did not pull the song.
And he announced publicly that he loved him.
With the time Darina was resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended by telling him adède forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing with whom his husband is sweet.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated there's no wife to welcome her on the step of the house's door.
"This is the biological father of my son, and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put it out."
"He's no longer my old ane loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," left Rychtarova filtering by showing that she was declined from her husband but they remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed his door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm gonna stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife established a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The society continues, I'm careful of repairs, garden, immobilier, I buy."
"Avec Darina is on a completely normal way, but we do not cook together" said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rytcharova finds a new love he won't prevent it.
"We don't smell together and he doesn't interest me to know where she goes, with who and if she has a connection.
I know that it's my fault, I got lovely of "Iveta and I take the whole responsibility on me," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Is that also a matter of you?
If you ask men to determine the typical visa of women, all of them, as well as others, are able to get out of the "of their lack".
My ladies, you're going to know in the following lines of women's vineyards that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Budgets
Your half makes you comments that you are depending on purchase?
Do you have to buy you at least a week?
Are you happy to buy and packages at the time of the money?
In your case you can talk to buys like a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their patience to purchase.
But you'll say, who would stay in the swimming pool of clothing shops, to search for yourself with nice clothes and then try them all in chain (the ideal of different colours)?
And although most of the women buying is a hobby, this may become a real hell for man.
Remember how many times you have told your friend that he's waiting for the entry...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big?"
"I'd need to swim up at least 5 kg - I'd start to do sport?"
"I'm sorry?"
Do you not remember these phrases?
Yeah?
So you are part of these women who are obtained by their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of people are allergic because their partners are always in complaining of their appearance.
The strong sex is not to say that more the frequencies of these complaints are increased and women become empowered.
Bow and ownness at the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Lay the windows, pass the aspirator, clean the ground, make the powder, cut the bathroom - and that's two times a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with salt foot on the own ground, to children they have out of the lavabo, enrolled the face of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
If you are just suffering from this obsession, try to have the mind that nothing is necessary to exage and that order and integrity must not be at first place in the family.
However, this unforgettable desire of selfishness may defeat your relationships and even the family peace.
The work of skin
"But this survival used in the powder."
"Do you want to put these old shoes still tomorrow?"
"A smooth service has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work on your partner several times this way, you'll really decompose it.
It is obviously that you don't think badly you want everything to be empowerable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have done so much knowing...
Disamination, persistence
Disamination, persistration, but also insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships, so they are pleased to treat subjects such as who, with who, how and why.
Maybe each of us let a little unforeseen persistent vision out here and there.
The heart hand is, however, a particularity of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persiffer, even misrespect others and are for their endurance - especially to work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hokeyist Jagr has participated two times in the victory of Philadelphia during the Monday NHL game on Caroline's glass and is again headed by the productive Czech players for competition.
From the view of the 39-year-old star, Clau Giroux, who still made a pass and was appointed the best player of the game, he marked in the two cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also registered two targets during the match.
After the match, Jagr declared the other Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his ha-trick."
"I heard it."
"Any time this feeling falls above you" explained Jagr after his Giroux action marked a goal of the first thieve of the Flyers.
A minute later, there was a second shock of the Czech team.
Voracek struggled behind the Hurrican goals for the palette and presented it to the buyer Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decent, but the beginning of the second party belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he is the best player of the link but he really is part of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I would play a career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy of this."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years, the other team players tried to play on me, now it's my tour", added Jagr.
Caroline made a drame of this match because with a purpose of Tum Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty strike she ended with a difference in a goal.
Matt Read did not lose other complications that end up to two against one.
"Pronger has performed excellent attacks in our area."
"He tasted on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote round of the castle.
"I tried to shoot it and I came there", describes the last goal of the match of his view of Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory head of the East Conference.
The Czech Defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not end the match with Buffalo in the second-third because of a damage in the top of the body.
The Canadians did not face an experienced defender their advances of two cabs lost after a torment of penalty by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick that particularly embarked the local trainer instead of lost poins because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We played the game only with an experimental player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's like this," said Jacque Martin.
"Replace on replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We were just trying to simplify the game, put the palette outside our area."
For this, we had limits " added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelect, Czech Defense Defenseer in the thirteenth attack of Winnipeg and the winner on Tampou Bay.
5 different drivers participated in uax goals of the Jets, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel Agencys proposed travels especially in the countries of the socialist block, since west travels were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the West and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited to the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist block (as for the Czechoslovacs) to travel individually in the framework of socialist countries.
In the case of the Czechoslovakia citizens wanted to travel individually in Poland or in the Soviet Union, a letter of invitation was not allowed, except for the individual travel.
Travel Agencys also offer travels to the West, however, to do the whole night with a bedroom or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it was not yet winned.
The agreement for the debts that were the condition for traveling to the West was rejected to people "politically incorrect" who couldn't travel anywhere.
However, the Czech tropical currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the western currency agreement to travel to the western.
The Czechs were most often passing their holidays in the country where there were many camping houses and chalets that the Czechs were purchasing, and this habit was to be long until now.
The trips of Czechs have been known for a great revolution since 1989.
While in 1989 the vacations in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs last year went to foreign for 4 million days in the world.
The great paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to move freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia in the time.
The elimination of vises in the last 90th century in the western neighbors has caused a huge short-term visit, especially in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakias couldn't travel for a long time to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, travel organizations in Paris sleeped the Czechs in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or pension.
The typical trail of a Czech travel was at this time to import with himself his own food preserved, saucisson, etc. to economicize.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech coron, which allowed our tourists finally after decades of free to purchase the western currency.
Our life level as well as the average wage has increased what has caused around 1997 another important moment.
Through a growing request for travel agencies, traveling agencies started since 1997 to prepare tours with aircrafts, which formically reduced costs in terms of the previous time.
At the end of the last 1990s, the Czechs had unvisual links with practically most of the world's developed countries from the EU, which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution, when the first air charter was prepared towards a exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as each year the direct air charters take twenty-third tourists into the warm countries, this winter will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs that visit the exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development occurred in 2008.
on 17 November 2008, the EU removed the visa for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully divide themselves in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in the history also spent more than half of their holidays in the foreign (50.3%) and for the first time in the history more than 15.000 corones per person for vacation in the foreign, including annex loads.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may be done by a situation without a solution "un pat"
About 5 months ago the Czech football is without the President, and it is risking that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly that has to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is no agreement in accordance with that vote regulation.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football direction.
Hasek gave his demission in June, and during his departure, he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead to football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football returned back to divergences between the Association rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when a new President had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly were unnecessary in the National House in Prague because the negotiations have remained blocked and have not even been addressed to the way to elect.
There was no agreement on the fact that who has the right to vote to the General Assembly - only, like it, state representatives or also the officials who are invested in full power.
In this single point there was a partial agreement since this moment with the assistance of the Office for State and Legal, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences are always on the election regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the Nebralgic point remains still the same.
The question is: how to process for the third turn to not fall in the patent.
"The discours of residence in the following fact: or proceed by the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic of Dusan Svoboda that represents the professional football within the association.
According to the model rules, the third tour of the candidates who have received the most powerful vote within the room for which it is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what it is said to be retired to win the candidate who would have received the largest percentage of the two rooms.
And the Czech party studys the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentage of the voice.
"All this would then lose the idea of two previous tours, and it would fully reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, which includes objections of the morrow part, and believes that the best would not change the regulation and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agreed if it considers that the election regulation established according to the statutes is most advantageous among all candidates.
"I want to vote at the maximum according to the status of the association."
"For there have not yet been no ideas of saugrenus imagined by a representative as in the past General Assembly," stated the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate for his exhibitions, particularly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk and believe that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructive way.
The possible qualification today in the Championship of Europe should calm everyone.
"The football will again be on a happiness vague and there's more access to cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec, which among the three have the greatest experience in football direction as well as at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe in this agreement but, unfortunately, the situation is very tender."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the designing regulations."
"Cela can again cause a blocking to the General Assembly."
"I hope as much as the sacred reason will win", said Rajchl.
It is not a lot of time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should have been held directly in Montenegro but which can say whether the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially distressed flight in which it had to travel to Podgorice, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, had not been deleted for technical reasons and was searched for a variant to bring part of the Executive Committee on Receptions.
At the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which may have been held on Wednesday, which should be determined.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sport Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties decreased in the most strong sports association of the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state donation, the credibility of football, and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which should determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the presidential position because he does not see any right candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's football chief had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would respond to everything he requested for a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) would not be launched in a campaign for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists, I fight for him and do not present me to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate", said Paclik to the Checa Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pella and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pella to access the AFRT's head, which preferably would be given favor for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if it would return the elections, it would hold this post by the President only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
It would be well in the function a experimental and high-level manager but that is not associated with the football world.
"I've discussed with people who had the profile," he said.
"For me it was horrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What, it is said, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man who is known in the colleagues as a lobbyist that can influence the vote of delegates of the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta takes this position of the President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing again in the football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high flight trader, it would be still less favorable to football," said Paclik.
It is still the fact that the name of Pelta has been announced a few years ago in the context of an investigation on a corruption case, for which Pelta has gone without any punishment.
"I don't know what prestigious Pella would bring to football."
"And how we would be considered at the eye of the EUFA and the FIFA," said Paclik, who said a while ago "if Pella becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the case of Paclik triumphing on Thursday, it should prove that he could cooperate with Ferta.
Rajchl, another candidate that had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, who had ended by a fascination, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great ability"
"It would be able, for example, to be presented as the Head of the Representation."
"But as the Association Manager he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nest in what I don't know", says Paclik, who took a great attention in September when he announced for the cancellation of the arbitration committee with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
He, as example, takes his ability to direct private firms and also leads the club of Plzen who celebrated with his support in May in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to make something changed in the sport world and to bring it a certain culture."
"I would undermine the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Commission on Disciplinary and Appeal, which leads to situations of misleading", added Paclik that does not chaste his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonisation of relationships with the Czech Olympic Olympic Committee with the power of lobby at high-level policies to obtain more money than game taxes.
"It's one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If it is the tax on the hair games as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he stated.
Paclik does not take its current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked to Jablonec and Rajchl with Ducla de Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don't see why I translated my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to return a half years later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statuss for AFRT that should end up the patent situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of Football Association, one of the candidates to the Miroslav Pelta President, promised that, if chosen, the AFRT will have new statutes that should be finished in the future on the elections regulation.
The officer of Jablonec is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of today's football representation should calm this helmet before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that has not been held, just promised to dedicate himself to the national representation and obtain financial resources if it is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last time before the last two months before the General Assembly, and this delay of two months could well enable him to defend his vision of the football direction and to present it in a wide context.
"The people at all levels have been from football for a long time and are waiting for a President. "
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he adds, but first he is linked to the Jablonec club, has worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
That's also why he has enough experiences to guide the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is an euphorie that was dominated at Ivan Hasem's time.
"Offortunately, the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as all have been seen."
"If there was no all these different interpretations, we would have already had a president since September," Souligne Pelta.
It is just a review of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention to delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I'm ready to take all the responsibilities in the case that it does not go."
"This is a principle without which we can't exist", added Pelta.
Then he works, it is said, not to face his opposers.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognised his legal training and that he knew that his candidate advisor would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't been attacked for a long time since Tonas Paclik who, on the other hand, stops criticing Pella.
"He evolves in the football for a year and has already been successed."
"But his attacks were not more honorable and surprised by many people during the campaign."
"There is also why some have any doubts on his nature," said Pelta to the address of his opposite but still, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapons, according to him, are his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the matters that begin with the Bohemians or the follow-up of corruption scandale."
"I would immediately enter negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the whole football," said to the Czech Press Agency on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of the football would not bring any change in persons.
"I should know with all employees," he stated in Strahov where it dominates a comprehensive nervousity since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, the delegates will not be in Nymburk for nothing.
"If there's only one point of discussion about how to vote on the third tour, we'll be going to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility, and it will only be obtained when a new leader will be on his head," as Pelta is optimized two days before the probably determinant day for his officer career.
Rajchl promises that AFRT will start working hard under his direction
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly of Thursday, this would not like a large number of people, like it.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case where it would be chosen, we will start working hard.
He wants systematic changes and make members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve the relationship with the EUFA and the FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue work by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"Come President, I want to take care of football in her whole."
"International contacts with EUFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a football for youth."
"But I don't say I'm gonna do all this alone," said Rajchl in a CTK interview.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each members take care of a determined area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions that the football makes a big step forward."
"Booccoup of people will not be pleased because it will start working hard instead of criticing others," he added.
He said, he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
" About me, we know I'm working 20 hours per day."
"But I need to know if it's the shooting and if I have people behind me, they will put me shooting in the wheels and spend doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was hesiting.
"Booth of people say I don't have to dismiss because they wouldn't go back too."
"It's a trust I can't trace," he says.
What is reasonable, it is also to continue working starting with Hasem.
"After these two years, I don't want to leave it."
"They have been launched processes that will have consequences in a few years and I wouldn't want anyone to stop them." He said with fear that only in the case of Miroslav Pella's election the situation in the Union would not return as she was before Hasset.
"I believe in a systemic work and it's something that Mirec Pella can't do."
"There are people who would do football so that it would be only for those who have been chosen."
"We can reprove a number of things, but surely don't support anybody."
"I'm trying to be a goal."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be satisfied not only those chosen
He reaffirms that it would be only a President for Czech.
"And if there are those who say the contrary, I'm ready to make the maximum for Morbian."
"For example, it is the time to consider that the second division will be divided into two parts of the Czech and the other wheel whose winners would be first division."
"The problem is now to find younger players, as there were only three living teams in the division.
As Thomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered the competitive for the President's position, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I always feel a support of the Czech Chamber that elected me his Vice-President and knows that there will be successes with me," said Rajchl, who considers among his future success to economize tens of thousands of corones on unsuccessful contracts, television negotiations and game law.
He said, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not unilateral is a common mistake to all.
While he says about Pella "it's disqualificated because with him the Tschech football would lose his credibility," he thought that the second opposer Paclik is a strong candidate that has offered to football.
"Personn cannot doubt Plzen that he has done a super work this year."
"If he had chosen, he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to smell his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A Shut in the blue
The Julia Stanek
Ovni optical paugeories, beautiful pools of Budapest: Traveling through Europe can live its blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long walk - can leave his feet in gas water baths.
A book shows what nation basin can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder traveled in the past 18 months, there was a object that should not miss in his bags: his bathroom.
As she exhibited his dust in the water, she observed the artistically arranged shoes, and sloped against the putten marbles that was waiting for him on the other side of the pool and lacked to smile the Art New Methicly restored from these converted pools.
If a coated pool was pleased with him, she noted in its book without time all the decent interest details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were examined in this way by the architecture of Meder and presented them in its book: "Badefreuden (Joies del Bain). The municipal pools of Munich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "Beton Hardcore" in the Taunias.
She conducted its "excepted bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locals in Italy, France, Czech, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Allmand of 46 years is a real fertility of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she has not a lot of interest in sport but it feels attractive to the water in a entirely different way.
It is unreasonable that nation supporters must be satisfied to observe blue carreals and meet from Javel's water bridge while players respear with epic forests or can listen to the gas of joyful birds of the park.
"I asked me a day why the swimming pools must actually be always so sweet," said the swimming.
"I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of water is doublely strengthening architecture
A swimming in a pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in the nation rooms are great because all the sense are washed up, according to Meder.
And if the buildings were given a little more pain, the narrow salts could be a real delight for the eyes, "On the place of a floor, there's a water surface in the nation halls."
"He is from a transparent side, but reflects from another side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically present in a double way: high shoes, multicolor carreals, tremplines.
The volume of "Badefreuden" image makes a generous report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - he certainly wants to make a sweet in the blue.
The collectioner Meder found remarkable examples during his research in Hungary.
Near the wonderful well-being bathrooms like the Szechenyi bathroom of 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural castle in the castle (walker bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a tears bath with water filled with alcali and (Városi Termalávordedaö in Yaszbereny) and found in a bottle building.
On the contrary, the swimming pools in full air of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a toilet of Zürich's bathroom has the entire city in his eyes, you can admire Arlberg shocked from a swimming pool from St. Anton's outside pool: Turk bath is filled with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski piste.
Maybe the most extraordinary swimming pool design is waiting for swimming pools in Lengenfeld: The Eastern Water Dome looks like a OVNI who came to shoot on the Alpen.
In winter, the vapeur is up of three open plates, while in the back-plane, the mountains of the Ocean toward the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
Javel's water odor does not eat from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal bathrooms have an odeur of sufur, of the arpád-spa in the Bekescsaba Hungary is a strong oil odor, which is difficult to believe, in a healthy space.
The odor provides therapeutic alcalinic water containing carbon hydrogen, which is almost black and its limon skins you slept in skin as you leave in the pool - a special space experience.
During his search for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder also was discovery: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and full air from the Tschecoslovaquia, she found her before a barrican terrain.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
By drawing a shock of eye by the window of the building-Art New in red-blank-yeun, she observed the expansion of the bad herbs between the carreals.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is not only possible to discover neo-Roman elements that are out of its design in 1844 but also a sea room in the Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.
Since its 1995 careful modernization, the thermal palais remains the favorite bathroom of the pool expert, Iris Meder, and not only because she is originating Blackzwald.
"It's already a nice rendement, and it's a foundation of construction styles as different in such a forming unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, the pitting in the thermal pool is apparently only a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail the speculation of the first materials
Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its sphere on the first materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann was responsible for researching the consequences of the speculation for the poor world.
In January, the Chief of the Group then wants to shoot the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84 per cent of the Germans are unacceptable that banks shown on the first materials such as Maize and Blee.
Two thirds of the questioned persons even require that the German bank and other credit institutions decline this business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of the Foodwatch consumers' organization.
The study supports a report submitted by Foodwatch in Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann pointed out in this article that the speculation of the Bourss on the first global materials, puts the prices to the top and that the banks share a complexity with the world's hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically linked to the Head of Germany-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation of the first material was initially introduced to protect goods against price fluctuations.
But most experts share between the view that the partners have been distracted from offers and requests - and benefit the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the different criticism of American competitionrs: He promises to invest reproachs and said, "No business is the pain of playing the good reputation of the German Bank."
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently reviewing the accused of Foodwatch report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the German Bank's administrative Board must be submitted – with a precise recommendation.
By the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be shot.
It could result in a reduction in the market of first materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new, but at the same time he confirmed its critics towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase of food money prices shows a special dramatic way, whereas today's banks smile to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be in particular under obligation today.
"The German Bank must remove all places from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculations," said Bode.
"It's little importance, for Mr. Ackermann, if it is a question of disappointed people or if the German Bank's reputation is played."
Ackermann's consciousness can first appear, but it is clear that the group's GDP wants to present a perfect image, a few months before it leaves its functions.
The German Bank has announced Monday that the President of the Administration Council will not change anything with respect to what is planned within the Governing Council.
Ll could improve its brand image with a abandonment of agriculture spectrums.
And about evental losses, he did not worry about it - his poster will care for it.
One over two would residue the placement on the first materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the manager.
By now more than 30 000 international people have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 persons on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11% found this legally that the German Bank proposes placements for which food prices are made.
Many customers from the bank would also take personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such operations: one on two would residue, after the examination, all placements for which money is injected in the first material speculations.
43 per cent would not consult such a bank towards their turnover, 49 per cent responded that they would reflect on the resolve of their account to change banking establishment.
21th house in Vienna
The Pavillon who moved
D'Ingebor Wiensowski
An architecture story with high, down and a Happy End: the Austrian pavillon for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 has brought prices, it was a museum in Vienna, and was left empty, and it was cut into ruin.
Now it is again open and has an exhibition home.
If it is entusiasmed for a modern post-guere architecture, for its clear forms, his hamburgers, its living and audacious, and its new building materials that are typical for the technological progress, then the parent of the Austrian Architecte Karl's pavillon for the universal exposure of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Baillon of Schwanzer has received the "Grand Price of Architecture" for its steel, slight, slow and suspended construction.
The construction is considered until today as an important step in the modern architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next universal exposure of Austria.
With its legendary BMW 4 cylinder house and its adjacent building in Munich, he was finally famous at international level in 1973.
His pavillon project was transformed as a temporary construction after universal exhibition in the Swiss Garage at the South of Vienna, and a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically or technically adapted to a museum - no walls to increase art works, so not a good environment.
However, he has been used so long, until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was increasingly delayed.
Today, the architect Adolf Crischanitz transformed the Palillon, now brings the name "Maison of the 21th century" and will be used for the future as a museum for the contemporary art.
Wednesday night, the Belarus Museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance cut at any point of view.
The new department was conducted well by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which has become the new Directorate in 2007 of the Austrian Belveder Galerie.
Husslein-Arco has promoted a historic art historic to a considerable career among others in his youth of artistic patiny, following Sotheby's museum, the Guggenheim museum and as the founder of the modern art Museum of Salzbourg, she, in particular, carried out the process of transformation among political men and monuments, obtained public and private sponsoring funds and established the operation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the Fritz Wotruba sculptor whose foundation has been exposed the same name, a coffee and a library are found there, and a office must be built there.
strict supervisory, small budget
For the achievement of Crischanitz, it was the ideal interpretation.
Not only because he had transformed and enlarged Joseph Olbracht's sesion with awareness and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied Vienna's technical University and that the pavillon was "a very important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and slightly after his movement in Vienna and its use change.
During the current transformation, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffer in energy", says Crischanitz.
The window profiles of the green façades were shinned, the isolated drink strengthened in green fibers were put and the roof was replaced by a particular safe drink.
The powders of the thermic bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and the full of friendly revestigations have been reliable.
Two sub-sols made place to the new exploitation, a smooth light panel between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entry - it is almost a new building, but always lighting Pavillon Schwanzer.
Outdoor doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a deep protection against the red-brun color routine.
And the cinema room is even exactly identical to what she was once.
And all this is under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Some materials that are good and cherished should be found, and who also like the monumental protection office," said Crischanitz and attracts attention to a green soil.
Despite all the contradictions, problems and transformations, the building remains slow and light.
This would have been difficult with the Palillon, "what came from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "forever on the bad place" and wants to, despite all "wearing the good conscience".
But in this case, the House of the 21th century is not on the bad place, because it is an opportunity for urban construction: around the Jardin Switzerland is just the "quarter of the central car" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And it may be another chance to happen: the House of the 21th century could benefit from strengthening another Crischanitz building, because the colleague Francesca van Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary art center, and, as he says, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the Jardin Suisse neighbourhood.
It plans a fixed winter crisis in millions.
The rail road company has developed a crisis plan which aims at avoiding winter train accidents.
The number of employees should double.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter accidents and delays, the "Deutsche Bahn" company will expend more than 70 million additional to this year.
The "Image"-Zetung daily reported to the previous by calling an internal crisis plan to the group, that over 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better access to vehicles and rail networks in the case of extreme integrities.
The number of internal and external employees for the deniving of rail installations and which should be doubled and passed to 16.000 people.
The objective is to defeat those of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the travel devices necessary for service within a period of 4 to 5 hours.
Two months ago, the Road Head of Garden Rüdiger Grube held the government and industry at a conference at the sum of the accidents of the winter.
The last winter, the rail road society had a great problem for the transport of users, because it lacks among other reserves in difficult meteorological conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been expected to have been authorized by the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The rail road company has been doing for years, since it must be checked the ICE trains' s slippers often more frequently on the shop, after a rupture of shoes had occurred on an ICE in the Central Garden of Cologne.
German "Deutsche Bank" bank pays millions of penalties to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann, the German Bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay an amendment to millions.
As the problems of the German Bank weren't already sufficient, the past of this sector's rattrape in the United States was compared with $145 million (106 million), to resolve a difference due to the failure of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothetic documents.
NCU Financial Market Regulator is a set of accused banks, and is to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have minimised risks.
These documents have perished a significant value during the financial crisis and imposed the banks to the low.
"We are satisfied, have found a solution to this matter, without the parties in a court procedure," said a German Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not acknowledged any mistakes in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which entered into a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of CNUA Debbie Matz welcomed the consignments of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (CNUA) responsible for the co-operative banks and is in case of failite to protect customer deposits.
CNUA is trying to repair the damage of several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and was assigned to the Court of Justice JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of hypothetical documents, it is "Morgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are on the base.
When the United States real estate bottled in 2007, this was fatal for a number of bank companys.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers was cut off.
Even if the events have already been held for a few years, at the current time he smells a tempest wind on the American banks.
Investorers and supervisory authorities have tried many means for reparation or sanction of lacks.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) deployed the largest complaints wage.
It reiterates 18 major international banks, two financials of the American Employees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in nature for hypothetic businesses of approximately 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank must also provide a remedie to the FHFA, which is several operations of a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter responds to "substantial losses" but without quoting a specific amount.
The German Bank had rejected the applications as injustified and declared to defend.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financing governance, investes colossales in the IBM TI company.
Since March, he purchased actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
As far as the large American investor Warren Buffett explains, without stopping investing in IT computer companies, since long-term developments of companies appear only to be bad pronotics.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed its opinion on investment in this sector.
It was already understood that IBM proposed services and computer systems for other IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered as a chevalier attack in the financial world.
The TI IBM activity is therefore granted the right to call on "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic emission that he has purchased IBM actions from a value of $10.7 billion.
His investment company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5,5%.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything of this commitment until now.
He welcomed the direction, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a super job," said Buffett strategially.
IBM has been placed for a few years on IT winning services as a exploitation of accounting centres.
Intelligence pioner, who are over 100 years, also offers software and consultations as well as business calculators.
Buffett had until now avoided technology enterprises.
He says he's investing only in businesses that he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacking rail fresh, lubrifiants or machine manufacturers.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 branches as well as parts of a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former municipal back.
This 81-year-old year was repeated in the 1960s," the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and had established it at one of the most prestigious world enterprises, through intelligent investments.
However, his life style is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors in the whole world.
His sense is almost unfaithful to win the money valued the "Omaha's Oracle".
After the Buffett investment advertising, the IBM actions increased by a percentage of buses.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a bore value of more than 220 billion dollars and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German law state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bleeding ideology" that would now be renowned.
The murderers of eight Turkishs and a small Greek company in the 2000-2006 years had an extreme context.
Following this new, Turkey and the German-Turkey population react with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turks the spectrum that the death of the death has been seen for many years: since the fire attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with this extreme right context against Turkey.
The fact that there was a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been questioned.
However, the extreme right-related network reveals the proportions of which the size is far far as predictable.
"It was a return to blood ideology", "This was the title of the internet parution of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper highlights, instead, that one of the authors had been a V man of the Constitution, and concerns the fact that German authorities could be involved in the extreme right barrier.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community reacted in Germany: she called this weekend to a quiet reminder to the victims of racial violence before the door of Brandeburg.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought to a fifty-fifth anniversary of the German-Turk recruitment agreement.
It's with gaies colors that cohabitation was set in scene, symbolized by a successive history.
The reports of certain Turkish media are the effect of a gifle: "The gift of Germany for the fifth anniversary" is the title of a article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murderers.
Thus the German torment of the "Jurance" is not free of driving the unilateral conditions.
"It begins to puer," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronics.
It stressed that people would have been killed, would pay taxes and would have contributed significantly to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police's action was very critical on the German-Turk forums and these had been discussed by the success of their research.
Why has no longer come to the mind of German authorities to investigate in some extremely right suspicion, the authors are surprised.
More than one has been prepared for at least a rhetoric means to be drastic: "If the case continues to be buried, the migrants will remain nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and pertinence of the punishment of the whole network," writes "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been explicitly explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen fire is deeply accompanied in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has been clearly shown to the Turkishs living here more than there was a tangible threat, and the Germans, about which the infidelity and distance were possible through violence.
However, the attacks increased the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Repeat the errors of the past
Another time is the failure of German policy after the attacks of Turkish press claimed: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen' fire, he sent a condolencing telegram to the Chief of the Turkish State, represented the funerals in Colombia by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, the number of taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the amount of its tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how many German-Turcs are deep towards the local law status since that date.
In addition to the efforts of more clarification and re-evaluation of the terrorism of extreme right-to-right in Germany, a clear message is that time necessary.
The Zürich Lake Scandale Bank
The most avventured Bank in Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and slow-spot of a crisis on the other hand.
It's a German who must lead now.
It's certainly not what Axel Weber was imagined.
After his spectacular department of the Federal Bank, it was known in July, that it would take about a so-called post in 2013: the President of the Swedish Bank's Administration Council - a large step towards an unexpected and lucrative carriage.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed, Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his recent solidarity and has made awareness of the future colleagues.
"The UBS succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I enjoyed the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But since September, he was clear that everything would change.
A UBS title trade in London had deployed all the bank security systems and had flamed around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the UBS Administration Board of Oswald Grübel, a well known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
from the Chairman of the UBS Administration Board is considered as suffering, and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally returning?
We have already learned that Weber can be consulted from the bank from February 2012.
And it will be re-administered in May, not in 2013, as the Monday Bank has reported.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
It is not banking, much more Professor of economy and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed a time of adjustment.
On one occasion, he takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has come to prove again once again that it has been the title of "the largest scandale bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is from a huge side - until recently, she was the largest manager of the world's assets, and on the other hand, she has been skandale for years on the other.
Nothing, it seems, doesn't escape the soor Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The picture of Swiss's active, silent and solid manager, but also Russian, was combined with ambitious objectives. It also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of bank investment.
Thus, the UBS would work on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an awarded customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had progressed as an investment bank in the bond of the largest banks in the world.
That made impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor in Zurich tells, "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"When the current optics are asked, how would I just have been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something did not turn around the U.S.U.A....
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli took a surprising way, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a genetic banker.
Some months later, we were pressed for the reasons he had gone.
The bank's division had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to do a cross on billions.
In order to spend this, the UBS announced a capital increase of an amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
For this, she actually found investors, but who had just a few years before the skins: an Asian non-transparent state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was under silence, at the point that it was never learned his name.
That was only the first time.
In April 2008, this was impeded.
The bank had to readvertise losses from billions, the President of the Marcel Ospel Administrative Board, who was still in 2006, was the second Administrative Board of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the U.S.U.S. was, taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure, and it was saved by the State.
The National Bank has saved the UBS of the tens of billions of challenges, and the Swedish Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible obligations to action, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
Everything Switzerland has been shocked - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country to switch from such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 UBS budget over 5 times chose the Swiss economic performance (see graphic).
"We weren't able to save the UBS again," said the bank searcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
Over a few months ago, the U.S.U.S. had been captured because of a fiscal difference with America and was prepared to publish the data of the registered customer, which may have frauded the taxes with the Bank's assistance.
Furthermore, she accepted a payment of $7,80 million - in the reimbursement of unjustified benefits from these operations with a increased amendment.
Thus, the UBS had been more or less published that she had assisted tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the skandale, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It follows the retreat of the Head of the Governing Council and the President of the Administration Board.
And about the exode of customer money.
Thus, in a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to bad speechs and the management of assets due to tax fraud.
And as somewhere there was a return to calm, and as we thought it was, the UBS would go out, it was followed by this disastrous stories of the title: a single market of flambe 1.3 billion euros, before the bank finds that something did not turn around.
And it is published: with the management of risks in investment banks, this doesn't always seem to work.
"In the case of Adoboli, it was found that the control of the risks of too few changed risks," said Martin Janssen, economist and financing professor at the Bank Institute of the Zurich University.
So the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it has no risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had taken their function for a long time, of become a warden of the great world's power: not too large risks, but money security, and the world could well be able to get out of the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks' treasures were the symbol of an inebritable reliability like Lindt and Sprmungli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS's central in Zurich will still be paid with the private private bank's solid - it's just a little greater.
Later the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Garage, which drives directly from the Central Garage to the Zurich Lake, which itself is rounded by the swimming tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the store houses are among the highest of Europe.
The doubles like Tiffany's, they are found here among the Swedish tradition shops as well as those of the Sprmungli Confessor.
Since centuries, Swiss bankers have resided here: from the National Bank by crossing the palace of the Swiss Credit to the privacy banks like Julius Barr.
We're coming to the UBS's entrance hall by a low door.
In the inside, the walls are covered by marble, before they are sweet shoes, and next to the bank's logo, a great label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swedish bank has one day or the other disappearance of the market - or traced the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the chief of a Swiss small private bank finds.
It would prefer to not read his name in the newspaper, as well as all Swiss bankers do business with the two large banks.
The UBS would have become too large, especially in bank investment, where the Anglo-Sexons would be further expansive.
The Swiss wouldn't say anything anymore.
"And even when, they have been adapted to the wheels of the Anglo-sexons."
This was in effect the Anglo-saxone investment bank that changed the UBS, and then deployed high benefits: no European financial institutions have lost both money in the sub-prize jungle as the Swedish bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This merrys the government coalition of the small country to the seven million people have undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hassig in its book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs around 45 billion euros, political men agreed to save the big bank's faillite.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks concluded a large group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for Switzerland, and recorded an increase without stopping.
What helped is that the two predecessor banks from UBS have complemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy, with a stronger impact on the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly more internationally.
However, international investment banks have been favourablely access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a large root.
Two names are associated with the UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, Head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, previously President of the Administration Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank searcher, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well heard in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, slowed a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would be faithful until the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have done at the end a decisive error: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance has arrived before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly recalls the leader meetings during which the head of the Wuffli Group has always expressed the same word: detroit Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the planet.
She commanded the "League Tables", which documented the success of the banks at this time.
After all the UBS wanted to get up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of estimates and transactions of mobile values, it has played a very important role.
However, business advisers, who had the responsibility, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the Fixed Income bank garden, there would be a great difference between the largest banks.
UBS had lacunes at the level of American hypothecary products.
To comply with this lake, the UBS launched in an adventure, which almost costs his life.
The bank is also the bank itself as well as a management fund created before it in the sub-American sub-private placements that invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and made the value documents based on American hypothetical loans, but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to go down.
"In the summer 2007, while the market of the American Immobilist was in flame, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, banking experts.
More euphory is larger the drop is brutal.
A manager after the other had to go, when a term for tentatives was more difficult than we thought.
A number of posts at UBS have become exempted and are until now banking.
The one who directs the large bank has a task almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, has already a idea: to set a term to the investment bank, a concentration on the management of goods, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be strictly attracted, as it is clear until now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti's bank chief wants to present the world its future strategy.
It was only intended to be a transitional title for 51-year-old Italy when the bank was separated with surprise from his predecessor Grubel.
Among the time, it was imposed: it must conduct the business of the UBS, communicated the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank to the Middle Eastern Status of the 1990s.
He cancel 3500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what she wants to win the money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already been put.
He says publicly until now only that he'd be looking for a apartment with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Intelligence cornels are offered in cities
In many places, freshes are considered as "veeper problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals are not cutting cities for a long time.
Some of the loves, some others want to dismiss from them as soon as possible. The corners belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplied because of the salt and the brush of animals.
An antidote against the " bird problem " is still not viewed.
During the first ostfriestical symposium on the cornels, experts said that it is no longer possible to cut the frequencies of the cities.
The experts of all Germany have discussed the possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in the citys
Natural protectioners were based on the problems of the city also on the exode of specially protected fresh: the use of chemicals in agricultural products is increasingly destroyed by traditional lives.
The typical cow trees chass, installation and shock made a difficult life to birds.
The corners are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 covasion couples in the Western East, in the northwest of which Jever, Diepholz and Ahim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative advertisements because of the massing of corners in the region.
The critics found the capture of birds in pigs and kill them with particularly brutal gourdies.
"The normal expulsion, evidence, does not serve anything", found the planner of the city and landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nids by pressure or well shoot trees, often produced unwanted consequences, said the Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtmberg environment.
"The animals are away, the great colonies divide themselves and divide themselves in other places."
The "fashion" is only imaginable in the exceptional cases such as hospitals, retrait houses or schools.
"We find us obliged to live with them, we can't extermine them anymore."
The problem is not to solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periferia, according to the opinion of Master Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of animals' evaporation with an overwhelming conditioning and more offers to allow them to reinstall otherwise.
Psychologue and ethnology, Uta Maria Jürgens suggested "info panels to the place of thrombouss" to establish fullly different relationships with those: "We can finally support a button in the face with a dose of confidence".
Jürgens co-funded the Ascheberger-Company-Education of Corbeilles in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informed about the life of these very intelligent freshs.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own view on the criticism of the sound caused by the birds: "They are a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Freshes do not only use work instruments to arrive in a regal but produce their own tools as work instruments.
Ethologists of Cambridge University had recently tested four fresh tests, at the point of intelligence of birds.
In an experience, birds learned rapidly that they had to escape a stone with stones to achieve so to a larve.
Without a lot of training, they determined that a stone should have some sizes and forms to escape the platform.
In a second test, the smooth corners should then solve a more trap problem.
In a cylindre vertically placed, the researchers had put a small seal with a larva.
The birds couldn't reach their cup with their bec.
Nevertheless, the researchers had set pieces of fertilizers to their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help they breatheed the small tissue of the small tuyau.
Three of the four frequencies have been successful even since the beginning.

Personal mass attack
The new book of Peter Englind offers deep and generosity. It is called "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and the chagrin: an intimate history of the First World War), it starts with a long list of persons that make you the heart.
An advisory to start: take care of this page and make it your brand page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Romanian account of Peter Englind, this list of personalities will be your GPS, a balise in these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disappointed and disappointed in war.
Peter Englind is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretariat of the Sweden Academy, which delivers the Nobel Literature Price.
He wrote here a book outside the community that he describes, with precise accuracy, as "a book of anti- History".
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no embassy and discussions on strategies and materials.
It is not so a book about what happened, explaining it, that a "writing book to what it could look like". We find the "sensors, impressions, experiences and humble."
"Beauty and Chagrin" resumes the experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less normally, both sides of war, young schools and botanists at scalers, through doctors, ambulants and sellers.
Some of us will be heroes.
Others of war prisoners, some will lose members, they will become crazy or lose life.
Their lives are empty here as the clergs of a church: while some slow up, they are slowly new.
Peter Englind's book disappears traditional history books.
It brings a dementia to the idea that the First World War is only aware of the terrible war of the throats on the western border.
"Beauty and Chagrin" describes pleasantly other war theatres: the Alpes, the Balkans, the Eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers presented in this book are under rushes; the Christmas pass in Egypt under the piramides; the twenty-twelve moulds are an incontractable problem.
This book is slow from the first page.
The war invaded the lives of these people such a natural disaster, such as a gorgeous Katrina that pushs the cordit.
When canon cuts stand away and you're a mother at home, do you stay or leave?
Who will come in any way?
Soon nobody can understand what happened, nor the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englind, "the lack of facts has been shocked by oppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspirational theories, dreams, cauchemars and rumors."
"Beauty and Chagrin" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborugh, an English food within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young mariner of the German High Sea float.
Their stories are mainly addressed of memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives may be horrible or passionnant, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are treating the privacy and the ability to get out of it.
By telling the story of a German school, Peter Englind wrote: "Erplace, partly replaced."
"Substitute chain, false aluminium, smoke imitation, paper bands, wood buttons."
It continues on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "coated sweet sweet sweet in the grain of moon (and ends with a false wood oss); the smoke made with seed roots and the skin skin of land powder; seeds of wooden skins".
He claims that "837 authorised substitution meats are registered in the production of saucises. also 511 substitution coffees are found".
Some stories address honor and courage.
A American woman recognises his own pull against the wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, according to all, men were intended to sit in a comfortable fault, a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, read a newspaper or a beast, and instead of claiming that such a vernis is synonymical of civilization, and that there is no barbaring behind your struck and closed chemise.
On the contrary, a British soldier realized that it may be strong to die, and that no one will not observe or give attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacred, we hope to have a public" he wrote.
It's unfortunately not comparable to "un encountered man in secret".
Other comments relate to the decline of a old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englind, "a war between plants."
He entered the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestier of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated mass and convinces ideally, in well-smoking clothes, who performs his bouquet while sit behind a shopping."
People act unexpectedly; they are found as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englind speaks of soldiers who tried to get a venerian disease in prostitutes to avoid service in front.
"We find the largest expression in the glood trade, which soldiers purchase and sell on the genetic bodies in hope of ending in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desappointed ones apply it on the eyes, which is translated by a cecy of life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englind is so much but not-ascensive, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In decades of short scenes, he introduces the way war "decreased only uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, a revolution for religion. "
People start to ask why their leaders make their war.
The best books treated by the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" of Paul Fussel, or "A western nothing again", Erich Maria Remarque, instead of complete.
Peter Englind's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most suitable I read in a non-fictional work.
I won't find her out.
But it's like he had surveyed from his book, enter your hands this page where the list of people is listed and burned with a wheel.
After a first false step, a minute planned operation
hundreds of police officers were involved, some with anti-emed boxes.
Monday night was selected because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret of all horses of some high-level officers, as well as other informed since the beginning of the year.
The police officer Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, stressing the risks and challenges for the police department.
There were no repeats of "episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of sweet gas against manifestants, which were going against the Department's Regulation and generated a tempest of public solidarity for manifestants.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of his manifestants was developed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by observing the deployment of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against employees - anti-terrorism measures that are to quickly move a large number of police officers - to concentrate on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session took place on Monday, on the side of Manhattan, East River.
The orders for movement to the park were reached " at the last minute " , said a habitant, referring to the operation as " a simple exercise " .
"The few police officers I know and who were called wouldn't know they would turn to the Zuccotti Park," said the person under an anonymat.
"The only ones to know that they're going to get there are at the top of the police's herarchie."
The city was holding a lesson, where the secret of the operation was.
On October 14, the police wanted to clean the park, but hundreds of demonstrants were dismissed.
The mardi operation involved officers of various police units, including the operational forces of the whole district - tens of special criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, and then one hour of the morning was a propice time.
"He agreed to proceed when the park was less than people," he said.
Cars of emergency services equipped with high-speakers were gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's bridge, before entering.
The recorded lights and messages retaining high-speakers have seemed to be intimidating the manifestants.
While the officials in Community affairs were equipped in the blue park, many manifestants simply gathered their business and went away.
No temptation was touched before 1:45, which left time to the employees to gather their business.
Other police teams were observed on the perimeter, prepared to act if arrests were needed.
Journalists in the park have been forced from.
Paul J. Browne, the chairman of the police head, stated that this measure was taken only by security.
However, according to many journalists, the police would prevent them from observing the intervention in the park, routinely reserved by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the TV cameras present on Church Street, west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the western through the multitude of businesses of manifestants, including bags, plastic gas and clothes filled with clothing, teams of the sanitation department were following, cleaning all the occupants left behind them.
Some manifestants who refused to leave have been traced. The images were distributed on the Internet a few days later.
The main group of manifests took place near the camping kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A tens of people in the campsite increased together.
Finally, two people were covered with trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chadenas.
No arrest was held in the park before 3 a.m.30 declared Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, cleaning operation ended about one hour and four later.
According to Mr. Browne, about 142 persons were arrested in the park.
most for " public and rebellion " .
Joseph J. Espose, head of the police department, is the most grateful officer to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Detektives Division, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "not directed the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the necessary case of intervention.
Barricads were placed on Cortlandt Street, a park north and on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expanding the perimeter beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Many officers, most of them equipped with boarders, had even been seen in pushing people to elect them.
About 28 people were from the north.
One of the most lively actions in the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 p.m. on the south of Pine Street, a demonstrant sloped on the head of a police car. Others were seen in getting the pulls of a police truck.
At a moment, a counter-played piece occurred by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police police and a protester were hospitalized.
The trade of school aid continues the city for licensing
The trade, which represents hundreds of school aid lost their job last month, intends to march the city for unnecessary and discriminatory licenses. The impact is disproportionate on schools accepting disadvantaged schools.
The continuation is probably the last weapons of the trade trade, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel licensements.
Sixty-two school supporters, parents coordinators and other employees, as part of the less well-bearing city, lost their employment on October 7 and the trade leaders compared these licenses to a political venture to have not left the city access to a health care fund for workers groups, which would have allowed to closure the type of budget at the latest spring.
The municipal authorities rejected this accusation Categoryly.
In the last month's hearing of the municipal Council, Mr. Walcott said that licensing was part of the budget concluded in June.
One member of the Council reaffirmed that school aid licenses were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District stated that they would comply with a complainant opinion by warning the department of education that it would continue; a press conference will be organized for official advisory judicial progress to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the department of the city's "education" will be the defence part. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of the black or Latin American or origin, such as most of school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the port of the city's legal department, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons of the case and therefore cannot make comments on the complaints.
According to a New York Times complaints, the unity would put the number of licenses in the most disadvantaged district schools in the city to support its complaint against inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular subfinancing.
While there was no license on Staten Island, and some in the Upper East Side or TribeCa institutions, 17 school aids lost their job in the 23th Bronsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th South Bronx districts.
Notwithstanding the loss of five school aids for eight employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 per cent of schools live in poverty, continues stated that "This is not a district of parents who can bring funds to the lack of budget."
The public school '36 has been reduced by 3,26% this year, and funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each "defavorized student” registration.
The trade also argued that the directors of Legislative Legislatives could have been wrong with some terms in a memorandum authorized by parents ' s license of coordinators.
The record used the term "passing" to describe the action, even though "passing" is generally described the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of workers available by the Central Office.
According to the complaints project, "seventy-six coordinators of parents have been licensed", and "not only because of exceeding".
Finished mission: Congress finds an agreement on the question of Libya
It seems to be finally that the Republicns and Democrats have found an agreement to the Capitole on the question of subscription in Libya.
There would have been a successful succeeding, capture and death of the long dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as American participation.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will take a next march decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "cover".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of Libyans while they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be unforeseen, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This was a conflict by two parties legislators, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to adopt or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited employment of the United States military forces in Libya.
The draft law was winned by a large bipartisan margin and has never been subject to a vote at the Senate.
But the same day on the failure of the draft legislation, the Chamber of Members also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of American operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purchase - the Congress is sufficiently contrary to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the herb under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was exceededed by events.
Tripoli was destroyed under the insurances in August and Kadhafi was killed last 20 October.
The NATO mission has been officially completed on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee for Foreign Relations "feel the Libanese people for his courage and special determination for freedom" and "feel the men and women of the United States armed forces and their partners of coalition involved in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism".
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to the democracy in Libya".
Does this new measure support the Commission for Foreign Affairs from Senate or divid the legislators as last June?
The Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His door speaker declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read all the last version of the new project.
In the Capital, the Chamber must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republics of the Congress, and a few Democratics.
The measure, supported by the Republic of Bonlatte (Virginia), will be the first Constitutional Amendment on Budget, or any other issue, to obtain a vote to put on the Chamber or Senate.
Other legislators have not yet been able to adopt their amendments, but it is not without trying.
The Amendment of Goodlatte is part of 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted at the Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same legislation project proposed both at the Chamber and Senate - and others are low variations of a previous.
At least 15 versions of the Chamber are taken into account only on the amendment for a balanced budget and another point that " would control federal expenditure " .
Some of these legislation projects are identical, but give their support - in particular the new Republicns who want to give their CV - the opportunity to be "the author" of such a measure.
The budget control law (Budget Control Act) adopted in August last requested the vote of the Chamber and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
On March 58 senators were voted for a non-compromising resolution supporting the idea of such a amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates in which the members of the Congress may serve, while José E. Serran (Democrate - New York) wants to raise the limit of two mandates for the Chairmans.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
A amendment prohibiting the marriage between individuals of the same sex is continuously proposed, as the amendment prohibiting the prostitution of the dragon.
Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed.
So it is clear that they have been members of offering amendments, they are not so fast as in the past.
At 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at 110th.
The chain slowed from the beginning of the 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but don't struggle" Gabrielle Giffords said at his first television interview since the smoke
Ten months after a armed man shooted him up in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television emission, songed "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and said to want to return to the Congress.
When it appeared to the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC chain, on the side of Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords used to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The 'emission' discussed its difficult return next to the ballet that fractured his skin and lost the left side of the brain through the head.
Three months ago, she had returned to the Chamber of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt platform.
During his first television interview since January, who killed six people and blessed three other, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, ried and sing - and qualified its reconstruction of "facility".
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "before soon."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of "20/20", distributed the old outcome of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a history of courage and hope".
The special emission was reconstrued by Gabrielle Giffords since the slaughter of 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, it was found on his hospital bed, the shocked head and a large shock on the front.
It can use only one or two dogs with the encouragements of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sit in a rolling fault while doctors learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A leg movement.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords shocked another word ("Toast") to ask for change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos distributed by ABC show the important role of music in the reconstruction of Gabrielle Giffords: is the Representative experienced to sing with the doctors Cyndi Lauper " Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who pass every two hours with doctors, said not to remember the smoke.
According to his husband, he was reading an article on the fire of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six murdered persons during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Laughner, was arrested in a Missouri prison and enforcedly treated by waiting for the prosecution.
"There's been many dead," Gabrielle Giffords said in Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, stop, stop."
When she was rebuilding, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been battled."
"Don't say, "Gabby, you've not been fighted," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been killed.
And you're gonna get out of it, restore you and get back stronger than ever.
More Love than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for veterans without home from the city of New York.
Kid Rock sing a ball on imputence, frustration and lost.
hundreds of soldiers, marine, pilots and maritimes around him.
The crowd in slaughter was cut into his feet to clause it.
"The military, men and women are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund collection.
A high-graduate military in the gala, who also participated in the Amiral Mike Mullen, head of the United States Army State, had regarded the role of the armed forces in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphelin," wrote the high-graduate military in an email.
I'm sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just the mercy.
Absolutely contradicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between military and a distant American public but often distant.
Rewards are made to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, claim some militarys.
The public works more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniformity.
"We are not all of the victims," said the chief General Sean B. MacFarland, who directed the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems to be the only way to support us is to shut us into the role of malicious spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders who do not want to appear unacceptable or in a consent to the public they serve.
They also realize that the angry of Vietnam's returning troops was worse.
Thus, the majority of the conversations on the mercy took place among the veterinary.
After the return of his two sons of struggle with the Marines, the colonial retradition Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would view them respectfully because they were faced with insured people and traveled to distant consignments.
Others would ask whether " an anger and violence veteran hide under the surface " said Cancian, who struck in Iraq and returned to work to the Government in Washington.
When he searched for a job, he said, he felt that some persons who were doing his holdings would ask substantively if he could hold the cut under the stress of a job demanding to Washington immediately after his struggle return.
"When you address the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions", remembers the colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
Military difficulties are, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a so little family country with the army and seeing little direct advantages of wars in Iraq and Afghan.
"In a country, we no longer appreciate the heroism as for the Second World War", states the director-General Retradition David Barno, who directed the armies in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, the welcomes of political and people are largely focused on the deepness of a military suffering.
The troops are recognised for the number of service periods, the number of lost friends or the expansion of wounds.
Army faced the growing pressure of violence against violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be injured against the army for a presumed invasion against violence.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The soldier of the first class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant of 11 weeks in the night where she claimed to have been violated by a soldier.
It was in October 2008, and she returned to his house in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when she met a colleague transporting a bird package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was a alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane was worried.
I thought, no, 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I'd have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after being entered in the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man touched him behind, shooted by land and violined, claiming it.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other militarys, some still in service and others, will be concerned about the decision of justice at a historical proceeding in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide whether a proceeding against the former secretariat for the defence of Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These are accused of not have stopped the generalization of violence within the army, thus against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case was classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer at the start of 17 complainants, which highlighted at 28 months following - 25 women and 3 men, all who claimed to have been violated or sexually abused by military colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, continued or provided the justice adjusted after the arrested attacks.
Susan Burke says to take it to the galloned military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are individuals in position to raise the culture of resurrection? Leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future judicial continues.
His strategy: Instead of gathering all the punishers in this case - putting all its eggs in the same cart - it will try several procedures, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has made a movement to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek are detailed of the defence strategy, and primarily the fact that the army cannot be continued by service soldiers or not for wounds caused by armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court called Dr. Ferres, the Federal Government is not responsible for damages undertaken by staff in active service.
" The alleged bad is inherited to the military service of punishers " indicates the documents.
The Defence Department refused to make any comments.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women have not yet officially the right to go to the fight, this distinction is only in document: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq, as in Afghan, women ' s soldiers teams play a more important role, in particular to engage in contact with local women.
The results of these two wars, 150 soldiers have lost their lives - two thirds in the fight situation.
It's time for the army to modernize Susan Burke.
It is not only to manage the fight: three other procedures are undergoing more than them.
At Yale's right school, the Veterans' legal services centre prepares a business against the four main military academics to have themselves said to encourage a mixed environment.
On the other hand, the foundation of the non-governmental Vietnam Veterans of America prepares an act against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality diagnostics " assigned to the victims of violence - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activities such as Annu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a group for Human Rights.
His group tried to prosecute in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in order to treat advanced applications for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual aggression in the service.
Neven independent law projects were submitted to the Congress by a bipartisan medium of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual aggressions were registered according to the Department of Defence and Prevention of Sexual Assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions are underestimated, and in fact, according to the Pentagone's own estimation, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents in that year.
In March, the report also examines the percentage of judicial progress: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases registered in the army were subject to a proceeding - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants of Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first ones of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she reports the Military Police of Violence less than one hour after the facts.
On that night, she was asked to tell him 11 times in detail his violence to various police, doctors and commanders.
She went up to a "rape kit" (letterly a kit of violin), and the blood of her aggressioner - the blood of a cut into her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sit before a judge, in a case in which it is questioned about his sexual relations with his little friend early on the day of his aggression.
Six people have witnessed as a witness of morality for the criminal author, which has finally been purchased.
"I remember the day where the great was returned," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start with contracts, and I was put to cry after the court."
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remembered that I told my commander, "It wasn't his process but my."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult an military psychiatrist, who ended by diagnosing a personality problem, making it unacceptable to the service.
In January 2010, it was transferred under less than honourable terms, the prevention of receiving any benefit.
Is Lyman's case and other plaignants will be advanced or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, Professor of the Rights of the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "As my opinion, they should be able to advance."
Only this criticized doctrine is between them and one great.
I always criticized the Doctrin Feres.
The army has been decades behind because it has not the same advantages and means of dissuasion made by the responsibility.
"The chances are lowly against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things are only changed when the goods have the will of fighting.
If the prosecution does not turn to their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other proceedings.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform."
Wherever we die, one or one of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before become the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Berring Breivik was a simple man who is part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
Monday, Breivik, who was recognised to have been taken from a mortal fool in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was compared to his first act.
While Breivik worked alone, he was far away from being on the cyberspace: he had been a large part of the previous attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extremely legal groups on social network sites.
After the tragedy of this era, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy... connect you to Facebook.
"We realize that it was not so difficult to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report recently published by the DEMOS Reflexing Group on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook controls so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers can simply use the website's publicity tool to find people they're looking for with a scientific specification - the way the markets do it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members were fans of extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with advertising, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the advertising invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions related to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism to their own future.
By contacting these people with Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask 10,000 partisans of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to find", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not very surprising: the online partys of the right groups are men, youths and against immigration.
But it is surprising that "the ones who associate online activeism and outside line are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new uncontrolled tool among the scientists' hands.
Reflexive groups, medical researchers and polytologs use the website to study all the issues touching health issues such as social trends, through "I love" publications on the walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add averagely three contents per day, "Date Supernova" generates a research explosion, increased the number of research works that the site name appears for almost 800% in relation to the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook stays in the fact that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach the street.
"After you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should give you to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have directly access to their information. "
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno from Wisconsin-Madison University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook of their employee operators were much more likely to be alcoholic than the discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-auteur of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Conduction and Development of Childs at the research Institute in Seattle, states Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and that wouldn't be in another unrecognised case."
Facebook also constantly accesss its users' information.
The "the site team that cares for data has studied statistics about the lovely situation and the day of the Holy Valentin, the participation rate in the 2010 half-mandat elections and a national happiness index (for only available information, the fields of digital freedom have long supported that the site could provide its data treasurer to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the website observes them, that they like or not, in exchange of ability to play at Scrabble with a friend that is located in thousands of miles, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard?
While researchers have well-defined designs in the way to collect information other than through the Internet, it is everything other than online.
"I don't believe that a lot of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologue at the London Connaissance Laboratory, according to a 2006 study by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"When they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then it comes to the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two very different things", says Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a blocknote and a style remain the best tools we can use.
"No one can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are required to address social aspects - and social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Frodo and Inhuman" : first comparison of Anders Berring Breivik
Anders Berring Breivik, the man who admitted to organize the two attacks that died 77 in Norwegia this year, described as a "the resistance" fighter when he appeared to the case in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance movement and the Norwegian Templates," he explains in a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"In the case of the court's competence, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting a ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognized the facts, but I don't like to be guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he didn't want to let him use the procedure to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a paper talk, talking to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge Nesheim also requested the police to keep Breivik in detention for more than 12 weeks, for four weeks, and warned that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and matches for eight weeks.
30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be put behind the bars.
Everyone participated in the hearing to see the end of the process.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya at the NRK TV chain.
"I wasn't on the eye, but I personally had a little advanced after I saw and heard the suspect."
In view of a dark and blue cost, Breivik has remained calm and professional during the process. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Brevik belongs to a wide "resistance" movement, the judge decided that he was not crazy, and he also said that there is no evidence that he has acted with companions.
The attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist instead of a whole group of roots, which may be comforted by some of them.
But this does not reduce the chastisement or confusion of the whole nation.
"I would prefer him to be like a monster, but it's not the case," said a parents of a victim.
"It would have been much more easy."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, in the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford, distinguished by the technical and ingenitor of modern information.
But what the fans of Apple can find more revelator in a holding of Steve Jobs recently found and which will be distributed this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how creative this creative spirit included the processes and flows of product work.
He was uncertainly a Creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulated and organized, as well as a organism improver - a man who believed that many business leaders had suffered from a "maladie who let them think that a genetic idea makes 90% of the work ... [there] a significant amount of manual work separates a generic idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series decreases the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, about 10 years ago, Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He worked hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at a popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have gone in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the garage of the realizer.
This video, slightly mounted, is the base of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed to the next Monday and Monday cinema.
For someone who knows to detect the deep entertainment, Steve Jobs seems incredible here to exhibit technological philosophy and its commercial strategies.
And incrediblely attentive.
At four different points during the study, the answers come a long time after questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, in which Steve Jobs clearly preaches his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Steve Jobs is resurrected, where it seems unlikely to hear the questions of Cringely, give him cooks to accelerate and pass to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there is an extraordinary aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what it considers good or bad in other companies and is part of his own vision on the future of the information.
It's something to read the posthume evaluations of Steve Jobs' carriage, but there's something weak and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxious dreamer at the age of the size.
He has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them then to implement them immediately.
This is a fast recapitulative of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to direct a company:
"In all these years, I always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are constantly the same, 'oh, just because you have to do it.'
Nobody knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details on his efforts to simplify accountability at Apple.
Simple in the way the costs were registered - it is often started by a "standard cost" evaluated for nest, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that guaranteed the specific calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour at Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the "Bleue Boîte" an anecdote he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that would be switching phone networks and phone freely in long-term.
The device has been objected to many writings in the prealable, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in its description of the Blue Boîte as a appreciation act is contagious.
He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, spending on a call later connecting a AT and T network to another by counting as far as possible satellites.
"We're developing the ball of different things a half-two times and you're shooting in the public phone, and this arrived a minute later at the public phone on the side, " explaining Jobs smiling.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Boîte, we learned that we could create something that could be able to control billions of infrastructure in the whole world. "
We didn't know all of them great, but we've been able to invent a small thing that could control great things. This was an unbelievable lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have existed a day without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour he and Wozniak: He phoned the Vatican with the Blue Boîte in the beautiful middle of the night by walking for Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic heritage are called at the middle of the night to speak to the American diploma, the two fellow fellow believers start to ride just before the Pope itself wake up.
On his love with technology (and branding by Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, at the chass on the cutting parts to manufacture a frequencymeter, he searched for Bill Hewlett's number in the annual year and passes a filling cut.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs obtained a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"Cela had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age, and this formed my definition of a company and the way the employees were treated."
Steve Jobs is then one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he found the "premier office computer never designed".
He was so big that a valse, had a small cathodic tube. I got a loved one.
The teenager I was back to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
on innovation improving:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a head cut.
At the beginning of his cart, while it is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer requests him to mount a complete computer.
Working only for 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as of the delivery of finished devices.
Afterwards, with Apple, it recalls difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great controversies... I was struck above by claiming that it would be five years [to make a mouse that costs $300]. I had enough, I was out and I went to see a designer."
Four-twenty days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
Over the major enterprises that are subject to:
Before Apple could be recovered, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and lost the control of their market part.
"Do you work at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopole of the market, so the company does not meet any success.
Sellers and marketing may evolve, so [they are those types of persons] who are finished by directing companies and the product specialized staff are different from decision-making.
The product gene that led to this monopole is completely used by people who can't imagine a good product with respect to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could stop the whole IT industry.
She could have made her current size ten times. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They shocked the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as artistic form:
"A large part of manual work separates a generous idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn about his subtilities.
There are compromises to do... some things that you can't do, the electrics can see it, the robots, the plants.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling each other.
Finally, decisions are taken by personal guests. It's trying to exposure you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you're creating.
Picasso told a day that the good artists copy and the big artists fly.
We've always hungry to shoot out of excellent ideas.
This is partly what Macintosh makes. People who worked above were musicians, poeters, zoologists, historists, who just got the best IT scientists in the world.
If this isn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are with opposers of health law while the court is gathering
On the day when the Supreme Court is meeting at home to consider the question of political discussion, it is whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, was noted during a dinner discussed by the Office of Prosecutors who will defend the case before the Supreme Court.
The event was held on Thursday last, when the nine judges were gathered for a conference to discuss requests for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was a proceeding by 26 States which contested the reform of ambitious health care voted by the Congress last year, a law which was a rail point for conservators at national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5 p.m. is expected in March next, and the result would be likely to promote the destabilization of the Presidential course in 2012, which will be fully shocked at the time of the Court's decision.
The lawyer who will hold before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will be likely Paul Clement, who served as the General Prosecutor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
PLLC Bancroft's legal office, PLLC Bancroft, was part of two twelve officers who helped to discuss the annual dinner of the Federal Society (Federalist Society), a long-term group to defend conservatory legal principles.
Another office that discussed the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promotor was the pharmaceutical gentle Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial outcome in the result of the crime.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top of the Republic of Senate and the opposite declared the health law.
The guests see dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against demonology rules.
In fact, the judges are exempt from a conduct code which regulates the actions of the Federal Judges.
If they were that, they would certainly argue by the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may assist fund collections of law-related organizations and other, and that the judge cannot be an intervenant, an invitation of honor, or a listing on the programme of such events."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the lawyers offices of the case, as well as a company with massive financial interest, has enough to warn the public ethic activists.
"This violation of the ethical and exceeds inheritance to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drinked and eated, and at a collection of gala funds with lawyers that have cases in a position before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event describe any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for the critics that claim that they are too easy to mislead the matters of the court with the agenda of groups such as Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile warrior.
Furthermore, conservators claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general complainant of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought at the level of the Court of First Instance.
Her critical pressure was made to Kagan refuse to listen to the case, saying that it was too invested in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would do.
Boeing registers a record of $18 billion for line aircraft
The Emirates airline commands 50 Boeing 777, bi-cool line aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated more than one billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives a order covering 50 of its products.
This is instead a case when the company concerned is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and that the amount of these 50 aircrafts reached the amount of $18 billion.
It's also unbelievable from whom Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft commands.
In Monday, the company of Chicago believes that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 airlines of a total of $450 billion.
In the weekend, Boeing informed the command of commercial aircraft in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colarics.
It's Emirates airline based on Dubai, which took this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced in the Dubai Aviation Salon 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy more than 20 flights, which would increase the total amount of $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company commanded six Boeing 787-8, on behalf of Dreamliners, a model that flees important fuel and commodities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than one billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst of Morningstar.
"They, in particular, have a great value."
In the Middle East, oil producers countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means of paying these aircrafts, but also the amount of the fuel price - inevitably injury for airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so nocive because the country would win the money with the amount of the oil price.
It is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or share their aircraft commands when the oil price increased, reported Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' command strengthens Boeing's predominantity on the market of large-scale aircraft and helps to shut up the airbus competitor's airbus test with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft hall arrives four months after the Airbus announcement of reporting the beginning of the most largest version of A350, which is directly evaluated with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejected his starts to increase the pool following the request of its customers to increase its loading capacity and self-employment.
Boeing company actions increased 1.5 per cent to reach $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico expressly struggled with the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug traffickers helped her adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the course at the headquarters.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost his attempt to access Michoacán ' s governance functions during violent elections, and she declared Monday that drug traffickers have favoured one of its opposers.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was head of the course at the Governing position of this Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized during the whole vote process and in particular last night is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country", reported Luisa Maria Calderon at the radio during a interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they put up urnes, installed road barges... and forced the people to vote." for the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-10 years until "a lost the Presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the 'president election' in July.
Vallejo seemed to have been noted only a few Calderon, who was heading of the reviews before the elections day.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's conservator party, the National Action Party or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently dominating the functions of the Governor, has occurred in the third, a criminal defect before the 2012 presidents for this divised and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the first results.
Vallejo, an elderly Master of Morelia, the capital of the State, had all linked to drug traffickers, and has well advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartles specialized in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine traffic.
This is the 'Etat of President Calderon', and he chose Michoacán to initiate a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
One week before the elections, a PAN master was killed while he was camping for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, both corrupted and Michoacán's elections, a victory will help the party in his ring.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidentials, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory is very encouraging towards the next year."
BASD urges Asia to be assisted in the euro area
Asian Development Bank requested India and China to prepare for the euro area to help out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decrease that would prevent Asian economy's development.
Rajat Nag, director-General of the BASD based in Manilla, said that the two economic powers to the world's fastest growth should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area by the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He has noted the BRICs (Brasil, Russia, India, China) to consider the difficulties of a "unfair eye" of Europe and reported that a Asian financial support in the sides of the leaders and resources of Europe would allow "eviting long-term escape of the global economy".
"We are all together in this crisis."
"So anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said at the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected until a certain point, but it is not open."
"Don't China and India help, that nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously broken by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of Italian employees is dangerously slow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have dismissed.
The growing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has struck the fear that the world economy is not returning to recession, and stressed the call of the main economies to gather together to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the FMI would finance any Asian aid, but also stated that this bilateral assistance - as to purchase the obligations of the financial relief fund of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - would provide a greater power to negotiate with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and India Industry, stated that "India will do everything it will" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in export and a rate of income from foreign capitals.
"A person wants the euro area to remain instable and slow," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to emerge, and we must keep a high level of growth."
"What isn't a choice, is an imperative, because where would we find work for the decades of our young men and women?"
Others support that development economys such as India should not help European riches while face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to accept Europe's assistance to 1,2 billion Indians, which at least 8000,000 live with $2 per day, or less.
"Another day they will discover that the Greeks take their return to 50 years of age and that they go to the sun vacation and they will have badly to wake it", he reported.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to maintain a number of Greek officials well paid in misleading jobs generating losses, such as the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the euro area was hazardous to cause "important impacts" through Asia.
The BASD predictions of an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now faced with the "risk of loss" because of the European threat.
He reported that the vulnerable markets needed to "develop aid plans" in order to protect economic return and significant capital flights.
Pentagon Warnings on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, made the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know national security, and deployed a financial reaction in the Pentagon councils to Afganist battle camps, through civilian assemblies.
The Pentagon already digs $450 billion for the next decade, but fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compression would be imminent if the Congress does not reach an expenditure agreement.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastators for the Ministry," Panetta stated in a letter to Senator John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, resulting in sequestration, would lead to 23 per cent of reductions, as well as the heavy of many new projects.
"An important reduction that is applied so without discernment would make the majority of our ships and projects to build unsuccessfully - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and bring seriously affected to other modernization efforts", wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We would also be able to separate us from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be taxed so quickly, we should almost send civilians to pay without payment to achieve the goal."
"These changes would raise the faith of those who support our militarys and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually touch the fighting armies, continue Panetta.
"Before the financing in war accounts for foreign contingent operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disorders in the basic budgets", reported Panetta.
"A contracting staff would be reduced, implying delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"Organized staff would be reduced, implying payment delays to war providers, and legal and political support would be detrimental."
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days later, demanding details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Defence Department would decrease a rapid decline in the United States as a world leader of military power."
"We are fairly opposed to this Dragonian action," Senators stated in a Common Communicator after midday at the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it's certainly not what we should impose."
"The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to be produced."
The Panetta letter and the recent warnings of Senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or call for exemption of the Pentagon Reduce, remains to be viewed.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though it has been reached at the highest post of Pentagon, cumulating years of budget expertise in the Congress and the White House, and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretariat has drawn a dark table of what could happen - a military with a kitchen but not a noyau.
"It's a marine ship."
"It's a band without balls."
"It's a chase aircraft, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of houses, buildings and bombs that are not enough to make the mission", said Panetta at his preliminary comments at Pentagone.
"It's a depressed, badly prepared and unable to face potential adverse."
"In fact, she calls on aggression."
In an addendum to his letters in McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically expressed how new reductions could "generate important operational risks: the duration of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; serious limitations to our capacity to run and launch us in the world; and the risk was unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could pass through the cutting, including those already tested and some just in the first towns of planning.
The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Stike, a new planned bomb, the Balistic Submarine of New Generation, the new littoral fight ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of Army and Sea.
A term for development and testing of F35 could generate 80 billion of economics over 10 years, but its parties say that it is an essential step to improve and respond to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to Repeat a Mention
A view of the recent smells indicates how falseness and lie are represented in daily life.
The Republicn candidate to the President Herman Cain is occupied to exchange sexual harvest claims with several women; each side accused of lie.
Penn State Administrators were accused of being sentenced to have pretendly covered reports that a football trainer at the retreat has sexually aggressived kids.
Last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone that affirms President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a mentor.
The lie has destroyed carriages and convulsions of countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebration of the Internet Anthony Weiner, passed to an idiot by quickly posting controversial dismisses by irrefusible evidence.
The former candidate to the President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-conjugaal link.
And then, no one who lived in the story will never forget the mediatic circle that President Bill Clinton deployed by mentioning in his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The tricky records at school tests and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the test responses to students to see their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the other thing send the message to which lies and tricks are acceptable.
How many fakes do you meet us?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 libraries.
In fact, many of them are worse lies.
Another study showed that foreigners have three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detect or repair lies is an essential competence that each one must purchase, both for personal and professional reasons.
Unlike being a likely company game, we say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've been you," the detection of tromper is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities who have conducted a research in a depth of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on lie have been demised.
Mentors look at you in the eyes.
They don't beat, swallow, or do not always.
Don't conclude that mentors are hard to detect and difficult to shoot.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by considering the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of answer.
I have been several years to examine scientific results in the wide body and always experiencing the knowledge of trompery, and it is clear that the detection of tromper is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employees, enterprises, negotiations or management, including your professional responsibilities.
Good mentors are able to read others well, put them to the eye, generating their own emotions and intuitively discovering how others understand them.
We know according to research that extravertis mention more than introvertis, than men say "centre on them" while women say more lies "centred on the others" - normally to protect the feelings of someone - that marriage people often mention their partners less often than the unmarried persons (but the lies they say tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a malicious, others will feel less guilty of you.
How can you tell me if someone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "instruct the rear data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure the following changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, rise, vocal quality.
You should know if someone normally removes his feet in continuousness so that you don't start injury when you see it to remove the feet in the meeting.
Then search for verbal and non-verbal false behavior indexes.
Consider these indexes as red dragons, not evidence of falseity.
Men false people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, shoot to an outdoor, changing posture in a significant way or present a post-interview - an exaged shooting shock, a posture change when all difficult issues are gone.
The questionnaires often show wrong that the maintenance is completed just to try to delay the post-interview reaction.
So, look at the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson was detracted by using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, starting a national research to find her back.
Men can also use a distance language: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a very difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers to a difficult question: "No, well, to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive response instead of factual and is often a red dragon.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize falseity is possible.
These skills will improve the opportunity of anyone to avoid victimization by angers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial olive oil plan will be deleted after the threat to the late approval of the United States
A few days after the Obama administration was threatened to delay the approval of an oleodide project between Canada and the Mexico Golf - raising the angry of the syndicates by eliminating the environmentalists - the society seeks to build the oleodide said that it is ready to redirect the project to redirect it on rail.
TransCanada said Monday night she will move the pipeline designed out of the ecologically sensitive area of Nebraska's duties, and is confident that the project will win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Headquarter of Nebraska.
TransCanada's officer Alex Parabax claims that the company remains confident that it will end by obtaining the approval of a oléodic, but with a different itinerary.
This is due to the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permission for the project until he receives new studies of potential workshops to avoid the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala Water, of large subterranean water sources.
"This is a real way towards the front," says Lee Terry, a Republica of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new survey of the environment commanded by the State Department had probably renewed any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials dismiss the participation of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support.
The oleodide of 2,735 km was extended from Canada to the Golf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 bars per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas raffiners.
In order to do this, he would have to pass through six States.
It is hate by ecologists, but loved by working groups, which took about 20 000 jobs estimated for oléoduc.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan are pressing that a law for force is the removal of the Sand Hills region and Ogallala Water, a major source of potable water and irrigation.
The survey of environmental impact in the Department of State found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, which included on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is to know whether an undertaking that has been employed to conduct the initial study was an inadequate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for pretendly caused a young kid to scare
A family in New York claimed that the divisive Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a violence defeat in the hall of the Manhattan building, terrified their little daughter at the point where she was scared of fear.
The cutting of the song "Lady Marmalade" was the 18-month-year-old Geneviève Monk, as she had suffered "the changes of personality, sleeping problems" and "the increased fear of foreigners", said her family during the Prosecution of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November of the last year when the technicist of Kevin Monk, his teacher wife of children's garden, Roseanna and Genevave were preparing to travel in family.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the hall of their riverside buffet building with their bags, bringing Genevive into his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she was arrested near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Who came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "Yes" and I went to find her," she said.
LaBelle admonized the pregnant woman with angry.
"He told me of your aggressive, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I answered him, "What you say or do not think I'm not interested."
She became encouraging and started to use jurons - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a water bottle and began waiting for me from the bottle's water.
She said that at that point, Genevave became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle sloped on the mother - who was always holding Genevave in his arms - and had to be guarded by his surrounding that brought it to a car that was waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was so strong that she got off, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting for excuses from LaBelle but did not receive any reply.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unexpected damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, declared that he took the case free and that the family intended to give the whole money to a carity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally inacceptable, especially against a mother teacher with a child of 18 months."
Climate adverse slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, the unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy was contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, who has made great expectations for the progress of the economy, but given the climate contrast of the beginning of the year, increase is not observed, in exchange, a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to losses of billions for agricultural sectors, limited the possibilities of the State's growth economy, resulted in general in the economic activity of 3,6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mostly justified by 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamicism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of the heats issued by the Mexican Rural Development Council, 582 million hectared 835 hectares were damaged, with a 78.03 per cent of the total damage and 21.07 per cent of the remaining suffered partial damage, the main criminal cultures were the fruits, the maize and the cheek fish.
The decline of economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, the State unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year, in the second quarter of the year, has been observed that the rate was 5,28 per cent and 6,19 per cent of the average increased in March 55,053 synalogues, which represented more than 74,000 unemployers, a growth rate in the first quarter of 18,69 people.
Minimize liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Economic and Social Sciences Faculty, the growth of the unemployment can be explicitly explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What it is observed is an increase in the unemployment that has been made to several factors, including market liquidity loss due to a restriction of resources approved by the Congress to combat money whiteness, because for people who win the dollars in an illicit way, it is not easy to work for them to win, invest and use them in something," he says.
Migration held
López Cervantes reported that the growth of unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of persons who leave the State to go to work for the foreign, the United States has been restricted, first because of income difficulties, and secondly because they have already had a lot of difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment increased," said it.
Serial lack
The analysis of the Sinalonia Labour market is aggressive, considering the high level of serious lack of work, which predominantly exists between the conditions of work, according to INGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state without cotising as a worker in no social insurance institution.
In addition to the unemployment and the lack of seriousness, the entity has the lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance and the Work and Social Prevision Secretariat.
The average month income of Sinaloan workers has been, until September, 5 thousand 352 weights, very less than the national average, which is 7 000 375 weights.
IED Contraction
Apart from the decrease of economic activity and unemployment increase, in 2011, it was registered the strongest reduction of the Ettranger Direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Economic Secretariat of January to June the State IED reached $630,697, which represents a decrease of 87,74 per cent of the $5,143,312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
At its turn, the Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total of 17.280 billion weight per year, which is mainly registered by the Territories of the Territory Sector.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the approval of a credit of 3 billion weight for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State congress was of 2,600 billion weight and until November no benefit of the engagement in any State economy sector.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patronal sector, Mario López Valdes' first year shows the lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The income of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, we need to work intensely to recover the field we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, and in particular, the good step already synchronized by this new government team, hope that the next year is much better", said he.
Economic Lenner
Loredo López stated that events such as the helmets of the beginning of the year have decreased the economy of the State and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including gegels, one of the main effects has been a short economy that does not turn enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable and flux level in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we will close much below the expectations we had", he says.
Reset Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Patronal Confederation of the Republic of Sinaloa said that it was intended to channel the State towards productive activities more than dynamicism.
"In general terms we have noted that the work has been worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefinies the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources is highlighted."
Many to do
The Chairman of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future vision that enhances the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to make good results in different areas, in economic development, there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", it will state.
He reported that the current administration has made progress in the manner of public policy.
" There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much has been working, and the Government is conscious of the fact that there is still much to do", he says.
Condemned for 8 kg of marihuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of office for eight kilometres of marihuana.
The General Park of the Republic informed that the small condemned trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in its variety of marihuana owners for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on the Cyprian Street Valdez, before the 80th number in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small tractor circled in a type pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black shoe in the car bag door and on the copilote place a small sack to two where military soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confidenced elements were made available to the Second Court of Division and the sentence is still in the Centre for Legal Consequences of Crime.
Debts for workshop contributions
The works of social character in programs such as Habbitat, Public Space Rescate and 3x1 for Migrants may not be finished where to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Michael Angel López Miranda reported.
The Social Development Director stated that even if the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, since the Government of the State has not achieved its obligations to offer contributions exceeding 11 million weight in the three programmes.
It has noted that the investment of these three programmes is almost 50 million weight, which the State must provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the Municipal has provided resources for workers, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the short end of the year, they have not given us anything, although since July they had to give us a part," he said, "and we, to not register a delay, we started the books and we have made many progress, but we need money."
He said that the State had not paid the corresponding contributions during the last year during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, therefore, at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that occasion.
"We had already been understood this in the previous sexual period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to work and this year, to have access to these programmes, we have had had had obtained resources to cover what the State had not paid", he detailed.
Despite the engagement of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages were reached as soon as possible.
"They have to provide nearly 12 million, despite the fact that the year will soon end, they didn't give us anything."
The valid "the analogical punishment" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of similar signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) declared the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Members had made against the Presidential Decree, which extends the term "associal cpure" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes required for invalidation have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its attributes when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow to the earthly digital television transition.
Consequently, the constitutional controversy that the Senate of the Republic has promoted, was decreed to have not reached the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court continues to enter into force on the Constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the Decree.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the Decree as non-constitutional because the radio and television regulation is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contrast to the principles of hyerarchic subordination and law reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members have promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and by admission of complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the Decree and all actions planned by the Decree for Digital Transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also discussed the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputy, without discussing the project that the Minister Sánchez Cordero is responsible.
In its intervention, the President said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to prepare public administration.
"I no longer consider if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive Executive, which has for constitutional mandate the State's leadership.
The replacement of similar signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered over the past few years, and this results in a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more strings.
To join the change, it would be supported by the benefits of digitalization that includes a decision of public interest which is not only a technical dimension, "for this also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, emphasized, "exige the operation of a system established in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions granted by the Constitution to the expertise of the State's executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries of the world have already completed digital transition, and they did it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had strongly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by deleting the contested decree, has infringed the sphere of competences of the Congress, as it ensures that it respects the laws issued by the legislative laws in the administrative sphere.
The possibility of a vote by vote in Michoacán is analyzed
According to the data identified by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor ' s election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting of the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 000 74 total procedures.
The possibility of the vote vote is a reality in the election process this year in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data shown by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting of the votes corresponding to the 879 of 6 000 74 total procedures.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria of the Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the election body adopted a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards for the federal election reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved or its Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice, while the Congress of the State has adopted the reforms short before the end of the legal period so that this electoral proceeding could enter into force, and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel suspended its publication within the terms laid down in the Official Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the Constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate for constitutional reforms, since it has no right to "sanction or contest".
Interviewed on the possibility of vote by vote, Mary of the Llanderal Angels said that through the approval of the guidelines corresponding by the General Council of IEM, it will be possible to achieve partial and total votes by the local election body.
Thus, the part of the votes, one or several election packages, may be only: the results of the non-conciliation procedures; there is no scrutin-verbal procedure and is not discounted in the urn folder; or there are obvious errors or advertisements of the verbal processes.
Furthermore, the total detachment of votes received in all the urges of the election may be achieved when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the candidate intended to win from the respective election and the second place in the scrutin is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second candidate.
The total depth of the vote may also be achieved if at the end of the common detachment it results that the difference between the applicant engaged and the second place is equal to or lower than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose second candidate is issued, where the electoral packages were excluded from the partial depth.
It should be said that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of 923 total procedures.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The First Minister, Mario Monti, will gather tomorrow with the President of Italy to submit the new Government to face a crisis that has put this country on the border of the economic disaster
The First Minister, Mario Monti, will join the President of Italy to present the new government that will face an Italian crisis on the edge of economic disaster and threatened the whole Eurozone.
A reporter of the presidential palace announced that Monti, on Monday, would meet with the President, Jorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
It is expected to present a office in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take its post.
Monti said he would present the President the result of his conversations with the political parties in his trial to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that it could form a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "cadre is now well traced", he adds.
Monti complemented the process to form a government in less than three days, in a less than normal time, while Italy fighted with a political and financial crisis that debt costs could not be supported.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard spectrum of authenticity required by European leaders to restore the confidence in Italy.
By stressing the pressure on the Monte to defeat, the instability of the markets to place the performance of Italian BTP obligations up to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have been saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian leader Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we will support this government very much."
We think that this government is the last opportunity to be taken from Italy from this emergency situation.
Monti's success opportunities were significantly encouraged by the support of the Silvio Berlusconi PDL Party, at which the crisis forced to dismiss the past Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Right Center.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant since many of its members were opposed to the Government of a technological majority that is in the form of Monte.
Parliamentary Support
The new Government of Monteni must have a strong Parliamentary support to implement what may be impunity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian foreign banks association was added to pressure by observing that a Montei failite would be a disaster.
Monti began to celebrate its consultations with the political, trade and patronal groups and youth organizations and women.
He will end his tour of lunch meetings at night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled to be extremely rapid in response to the crisis.
After a brief reply at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to dismiss, the costs of Italian debt are now critical among the uncertainty of the success of the new minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections planned for 2013, despite generalized predictions of the fact that politicians will only give him the time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but large parties stress that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections before a financial pressure process.
Political sources reported that the reciprocal disadvantages and the deficiencies between parties are difficult to include political figures.
Spain's experience is higher than the coarcans
22 footballers called Spain, over 50 international games participated.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 guests participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convocated by the two countries today for the friendship at 15:05 at San José National Stade.
While national and European champions, the number of one of the monthly classification of the FIFA, accounts for a range of inter-selected games of class A, Tricolore only has the defender Michael Humana as the only 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Thursday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the Ligue of Stars and the powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in national links and cutting championships and conflicts in European cuts such as the Champions League.
All this has to be added to the experience of Furia Spain during the complex eliminations of the European Coupe and the World Football Coupe.
Coastal footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to a zone, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be lower in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is the of the igiker Casillas guard, whose previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equals the record of the former guard of Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will put a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain flight of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognised the previous week by the EUFA with the other hundreds of the Vehicle team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the prior centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Preparation of the centuries number is found with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the coastal side, and near Michael Humana is the left lake Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and buster Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five over the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Aftero Moreal has only four games and Jord Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin.
The historical buyer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 moulds, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the most recording, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintato included the country in his tour to celebrate two decades of trail
"Come to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stade.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that there will also be a dream to become a reality in this country.
It is that the Bassist and founder Jeff Ament firmed, talking only with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South America fleet of its celebration tour of two decades of work and will be the only scale in Central America on Sunday 20.
The day will be presented on the National Stade at 19:30 p.m. next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, which is completely translated in the La Nation on the Internet.
For its coastal adeptes, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen to Costa Rica is a dream to become real. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and it has been great until now.
I passed to Costa Rica only once the holidays; it's a so beautiful country and I think we can pass a few days.
So it feels like to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live intensely in the previous days.
What is your message for your most adeptes?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
We had 21 years ago to arrive to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we've been sorry for the fact that it had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Is this adds a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we offered during the last 21 years have occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has made us formed for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient of producing it.
We love this country, we like to do a surf and jongle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its vagues to do surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make a surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in the coast of Mexico, are large places to make surf; so we learned it through the boys who love the surf.
By seeing the tour, you have offered great shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restriction on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible, with a great variety of songs; we'll try to interpretate two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is that supposed to be?
I think it's partly because we have new disks and we can interpretate more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, so it's very difficult to choose what songs to interpret each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have no longer interpreted for a long time, this helps us to stay concentrated and surprised because that reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also more interesting for people.
With this tour, you'll celebrate 20 years of driving.
When looking back, is it difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that no one of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years that it seemed to be a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together feels much.
We love and worship music.
We're lucky to go to the world's places where we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you that you have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grung?
This has always been a honour to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move appears from a group of friends and is little common.
From time to time, a group appears from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups get out at the same time of the same city.
We're proud and it's a honour to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them in time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to be friends with them all and it is an honour to become part of the sound of Seattle.
It's so strange that a group like your unix and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only it is much more than many groups normally.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all are worried about others.
We're all intime friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give free to each experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music of each one and that couldn't go better.
Your relationship with the célébrity has not been easy, but, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier to find a balance.
We assure that we do not pass too much time in turn because it's easy to break into this game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
If it is not forgotten that people are here for music, it helps us not forget that we need to respect music and what has brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which really does not interest in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written good songs, and at the beginning it's been great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before Andy's death.
There have been a lot of frustrations for the fact that she has longed so little and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he was riding, it was always a joy to work, ride, talking about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and he missed us.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for this you chose it for opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals, and it has been the group we loved most, so we are surprised to see what Las Robertas can offer directly, and that must be very distractive.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's him who sing and I think he's doing it with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are his influences?
There's so many...
Among the first ones I remember Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could speak all the midday about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining relevant grunge, despite the fact that it is no longer in mode?
I think we all feel a little unconnected of the grunge word.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups I've come to mention, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all that happened at the same time, and, if it is now relevant, I think that it's wonderful, because it's a music that is to hear and groups like Mudhoney makes the best music than ever.
At first, his music had more darkly, and now it has become more positive.
What should this change be made?
It's interesting, because I believe there are songs in the new album that seem to be lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cryed when I heard them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a parents or friend, these things start to influence your art, your music, and these songs, of course, represent that for me.
I also think that we can also be happy, even as we can do the dark music.

Re-hospital Fujimori for Medical Reviews
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscular force he presented in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori of 72 years of age, who pursue a sentence of 25 years of prison for violations of human rights during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various affections, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and that is under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, declared the TV for Canal N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Maladies to determine the cause of pain and strength losses in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimorri would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the punishment for humanitarian reasons, uncertainly, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
He has been operated four times of language cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathology, such as a severe gastronomy, a pancreas skis, renal calculations, blood hypertension and swimming problems in the feet, listed the physician.
Fujimori cleans the resolve since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 persons because of an armed anonymation scandal that operated in the first years of his government.
Muzik travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A official court, headed by the Uruguayn President, José Mujica, and formed from various ministers and patrons, will start a visit to Mexico to extend trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will join the next Monday with its mexican homology, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayn community in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "acceptable for information exchange in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the President of the South America country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that was held when the French mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradise, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his discours, Sarkozy threatened countries that continue to be fiscal paradise, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and calls for consultations from his ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been chaired since November in the G20, a group of emergency and stronger developed countries in the world, and has entered into force with the South America country, since January this year, a Convention to exchange fiscal information to avoid double tax.
The Government of Uruguay has tried the recent years to decrease the processing of fiscal exchange agreements for the "great list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OCDE), integrated by countries which do not implement all international fiscal cooperation standards.
On the trade, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force since 2004 a Free Trade Trade (TLC) which increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
Moustach plombier passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario was unfaithful, for 25 years to save the princess Peach of the pieces of the bad Bowser, but he never did it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young man in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to the shops of all the world, was designed since the beginning to exploit the features of the mobile Nintendo 3DS console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using lunetts.
"Mario is the personality that must say how to work the stereoskopy without lunettes," said the specialized printer of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", since until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "small" to increase the less accessible users.
Once overcome, the most experts can do a "second tour" at the level of game, which is more difficult.
Furthermore, users will be able to choose real time between a "D aggressive" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions so that the different challenges can be overcome and "not matching optical illusions".
This super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also requires the return of personality to a mobile console, which has not been passed since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eye cline to the saga adeptes and repeats the form of success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plombier must go through mining platforms of pellets to free the princess Peach.
Even if I player find newties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the cases of Luigi "joy".
Colum gives his avail to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alberto Colom announced the last Monday that he had ordered for the extradition of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiration for the whiteness of 70 million dollars.
This ends the procedure that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country who claimed Portillo to judge it.
In press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of the judiciary and executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered its extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in no judicial resolution and had provided all extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will also be extracted for serious murderers and lessons, and Edgar Strerada Morales and Victor Strarada Paredes will be extracted for drug traffic.
What Colum prescribed an executive approach after the exemption of all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former mandate of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitution (CC), Portillo should be extracted after solving its legal situation in Guatemala and after safeguarding its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the distortion of funds of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was the President, which was the case before the extradition, but the Public Minister called and reacted the case.
Trinijove helped 6.000 young people in risk situations
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6.000 young people in risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during the fourteenth century.
This adds the long census of work positions currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday served last year to make the balance in a celebrated act in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping, without work, less formed people with drugs or marginalized problems.
The celebration in Sant Andreu has focused on a number of entities and institutions who in these 25 years cooperated with the association.
The variety of political representation, in full election season, showed the unilateral nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Under the President of the Regional Government Catalan (General), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jord Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former adjoint master at the master and current eco-socialist municipal adviser Ricard Goma.
It was also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats, the current Minister for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and Director-General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the present is also it, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove, for example, to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficult times.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work that it does", he says.
Properties invaded by squatters for micro-features, evacuated
The invaders were suitable from 11 of 13 building apartments in Balmes, 51.
12 employees left the property at midday afternoon without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the castle that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived out.
Twelve people left the building that they were illegally employed and where they organized micro-feests that defeated neighbors, by judicial order and without a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door closed was changed to avoid the situation repeated.
"After that day there will be a control of access", the Administrator states.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of the building were living -, brought the electrical installation and a part of the water, instead of painting the walls and leave their residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass feasts, which were up to two days and disappointed the localists.
Near the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that its business was 80% since the building was employed.
The owner of the disk said that the owners of the owners were able to make it unfaithful, because they sold the three euros, while they were in the disc 10.
Moreover, the owner of the loaser place had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the brush, while, according to this, the injuries were not caused by the disquete clients, but by the people of the busy home, and especially by the participants to the busy festivals, which were more frequent and intense in the past weeks, according to the irrelevant neighbors of the area.
The dictator of the disco explained that the injuries were so large that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building, and that makes nine months that the "he's forgiving" loans it.
The Guardia Urbana (Música Police) also confirmed that the last weeks they received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
The President of the municipal group of the PP of the Marie, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested the last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the communal and civic life problems that it caused residenties and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a stage of the building was busy, but last months the squatters were busy all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and there were also flights in some apartments.
In this sense, he added that "that must end with impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in the ownership".
On the other hand, the Moscows (the local Catholic police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Montral 35, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had noted that four persons were accessing to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincidence on the possibility of convocation beyond the honourary
Municipal competition on 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-80s, in full support of the Barcellona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed exhibits of Collserola's promotion.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelone.
It also contains a comparison, in numbers, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, the highest limit of Barcelona, the Catalonia capital is the only one that does not stand on the north-South as well as high (montagne) - bas (mer).
Collserola's qualification as natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park, except Yellowstone, with blood skins in the role of Yogi.
This was the situation until, September, the María convoked a mega-competition composed of 16 concours for all access to Collserola.
A door goes to the park idea, without any doubt.
That's, or someone wants to put the doors on the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
Concours, both in respect of his organization and in the reflexion on the city is a discussion theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It is almost a recurrent theme with two members of this old election box speak when they recognize in a staircase.
And this is just one of the rare opinions about which three architects in Barcelona, university teachers, have been presented there.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Rolandan, after overcoming the literature front, "It's necessary to discuss on the "month front" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, that of the palaces of green houses has not been conducted at the end.
"The most broadest park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, given the architecte for which the title of "Colserola ports" refers to a "lexical piece": it is not necessary to think about those "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to do".
Model, as Roldán and Bayona with the experience in the urban world, qualifys the proposal as "Intelligence Defie" with "what dangers".
Pearls resulting from "the incertitude of public space projection" after experience lived in the 1980s and in the Forum's "cygne song".
The first fear is the delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means to set the next step, i.e., its oversight.
"Now new urbanist instruments, planning instruments, as the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] may cause real disasters."
In addition to the question, Model believes that, simply simply, the Vant of the Collserola region "to be heard as a park, the Barcelone, not".
Model recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patron, which "not must be lost", thanking the opportunity that the Major offers its corporation to participate in this project "It's the first time".
He also believes that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the out-conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "double" if this technical profile must lead multidisciplinary teams ("total success," he says, "We, architects, should be only a instrument".
Bayona instructs that the answer to the question that gives the title of this part is complex, because it lacks a global vision of Collserola: "The vision was called 16 cross-border concours - he says - in the sense of mountain-mer, but there is no long-learning reading that sees and understands the area in its whole".
This, at least in that case, made it possible to participate in the 16 concurrents.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can be shocked in the program and defined with the architect of the neighbouring door architect.
In his view, yes, the matrix should ensure that the band immediately higher than the Ronda de Dalt should, in all its extension, provide a area of equipment that performs a slight transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and it will be delivered in freedom
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority foundation of the Casino Red granted the forgiveness to the brother of the Master of Monterrey for the prosecution initiated against him for defensive chantages
After being arrested 72 years, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released free after the legal power of the Casino Red, he granted forgiveness to the Second Penal Court of the District, which follows a procedure for changing against the brother of the Master of Monterrey.
After the event of the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas presumed requested the payment of an economic contribution to the master of Monterrey to allow the clandestin function of the game house.
After the public condemnation, the Parquet opened a criminal prosecution against the Brother of the PANist, and on 2 September, it was arrested and maintained in a provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Office of the Public Minister 3 of Family Crimes, it was transferred to the Detention Center 1, situated in the Old Quartet of the State capital.
The following 49 days, when a second detention order was sent to him after the Public Minister has deleted the organized crimes of corruption and crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Criminal Center of Caderyta to have been sing with a million and half weight the owners of the Casino Red; but he was only a few hours in the security centre because there were threats to die against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the procedure in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of the Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the headquarter of the Second Penal Court of District Jorge Yánez, which said that nearly two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence to determine the culpability of Jonas, such as the assignment of 1.5 million weight of the representatives of the Game of Game in exchange.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented before the judge José Luis Pecina to demand for the brother of the region's master; therefore, he could restore his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the official of the Public Minister attached to the Court Ramiro Arias asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and whose partners of the game house had been the one who had granted the forgiveness, but the lawyer tried to not communicate the name.
In accordance with the article 197/2011, the legal forgivement of Jonas Larrazábal and afterward, there will be no complaint on the prosecution against him; no punishment and punishment will be requested to him.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the game house, at 15:50 a.m. it was ordered for Larrazabal Bretton's immediate freedom.
The Court of Justice, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to report to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his dossier would be classified.
He will also communicate the immediate freedom order that the judge has issued.
The secretariat Dionisio Pérez Yacome communicates the details of the air accident in which he lost his life the secretariat of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Government's secretariat, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, were clearly shocked directly against the earth in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try a forced atterering.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, secretariat of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft was collected, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the pales have contacted the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the shooting."
He also informed the fact that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so that it satisfies the requirements required for the transport of staff.
He also said that the investigations made in the impacket area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"The investigation reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and complied with the requirements for transporting them.
The earth presented a seven- to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the time, the secretariat has assured that a priority is to have the results as fast as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take one year.
At its tour, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistant Services, assured that the moment of the impact, the Helicoptère of the President's Helicoptère operated in speed to cruise, and that occurred on a falling soil.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, Pérez Yacome's SCT holder, referred to six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Vol:
According to the airline, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visibility of the visual flight, which implies that the equipment must be visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicated appropriate conditions for decoration, and at the flight and as the aircraft advanced to the border zone between DF and Mexico State, there were low nebulous nebulosity skins.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, because of the nervous conditions, the equipage has searched for a lower and more visibility area towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
Impact coordinates and the latest registration of the aircraft on the coincidence radar, probably before the imppakt there was no loss of control or altering the flight trail.
Dispersion of the rest of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available to this day allows to suggest that the imppakt has occurred on a right and latter trail.
The switch model of the rest of the aircraft allows to suggest that helicopter has suffered from the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No fire or explosion tracks were detected:
There is no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the survey indicated that the aircraft had had several contacts with the ground.
During the field work, aircrafts were found at a height of 9000 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the earth presented a pint that was seven degrees to 30 degrees of clination.
Photographies show the sequence in which it is possiblely discertified during his traject.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopter may have multiple effects on the ground.
After a minute research in a more broader area than the circle, around the accident, the aircraft has not found dispersed parts, which supports the presuming that the impact has occurred in structural integrity conditions.
MSS protocol advertising to find the gene of obedience
Social insurance directs a investigation to discover the gender of obedience in the case of children and youth; this is supported by IPN experts
The Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it leads to an investigation to discover the gender of obedience in the case of children and youth, called the Genetic Protocol for children and adolescents, which will enable to have overpower markers.
In a communication, the Head of the Medical Investigation University in Biochemia of the Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López explained that there had been a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistance.
This team is supported by experts and students of third cycle of the National Institute of Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Investigation and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate in the population with or not right, to submit to the participating sport units of the IMSS in Mexico Valley, where the evidence to the minors are made at 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started in the Sports University of Cuauhtemoc (Penente State of Mexico) and that from 8 October the activity was carried out in the Sport University of Nezahualkoyolt (Occidental Mexican State).
After reaching the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue to be at the University of Sport Independence (south of the Federal District) and finally at the University of Sport Morelos (on the north of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the purpose of this investigation was to know the components and the importance of the genetics in the development of obedience and to identify in children and young mexican risk factors to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Day of the Diabetes will be celebrated on November 14, he stated that the objective is to gather three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family heritage of their diseases to avoid risk factors that delay affections such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He has detailed that all participants of anthropometric measurements (poids, sizes, circle of size), artery pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the attempt to identify the persons associated with child obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of health professionals for the expansion of weight in the case of minors.
" Health surveys 1999 and 2006 reported that in the case of boys, 77 per cent in obedience and 47 per cent of the girls, and overpoids also increased dramatic growth,” said the ISS specialist.
He stated that the justification for trademarks is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that in the meantime, the Mexicoans have 65 per cent of the Indian American heritage, 30 per cent of Europe and five per cent of African people, and that is reflected in people associated with diabetes and superpowers.
He explained that generally the genetics of obesity were incapable of burn the energy exceeding consumed (calories), which is in the form of grass.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of superpower or obedience.
It even states that the presence of dark color (acanthosis) on the cow and pre-bras shows the probability of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors send it in writing to parents, to which each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to be achieved to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause superpowers, obedience and other chronic affections: the sedentarism, which is lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day sit before the television and use transport means instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high heat bringing, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbon hydroats (tamals - meat patate to the grain of measuring sweet in grain -, pain, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high content of grass and proteins and the genetic analyzed in this protocol.
The UNAM asphalte would avoid casses
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develop asphaltes changed with polymers to produce a melange with a better performance, independently of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavilion was resolved, it would not be necessary to repair about 2000,000 casses every rain season in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Chimical Faculty (FQ) of UNAMS, which ensured that if the construction and maintenance of the bituminum pavil is adequate, the casses could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference A technological opinion on casses, organized under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the lab which is responsible to develop asphalts changed with polymers to produce a mixed with similar features of asfalt but with a greater mechanical resistance, both with higher and lower temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of changed asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve the performance of cassis training.
He explained that asphalte, the larger part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a larger molecule weight, called asphalten, and molecules with a low molecule weight called malthene, which together give its visional behavior.
The viscosual behaviour of the asphalte consists of the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it is as a liquid at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalte becomes slow, adds it.
This means that the resistance of asphalte is not uniform in the streets and is changed during the day in accordance with environmental and temperature conditions, it warned the expert in chemical engineering.
The researcher of FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pavilion, consisting of six material beds, of which the three lasts include asfalt.
Among the surface beds there is the asphalte couch, formed by small stones swimming in asfalt and compacted afterward.
Each of the small stones that form the skin, signal it, is swimming an asphalte.
When vehicles are walking by generating efforts, it allows the forces to provide well in the pavilion.
If we had the asphalte changed, these would be better propaging, think the chemical engineer.
On the asphalte skin, he says, the last skin is placed with a ruling shoe, made in finished stone, i.e., the skin that is also swimming in asphalte.
As it is the kit in contact with the roues of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalte kitchen and provide the accessibility on the street.
As a part of the pavilion that receives and distributes the efforts, the ruling bag requires also that it has an appropriate wheel and the material to be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, because they are significantly affected by the performance of the asphalte kitchen.
When the floor shrinks, the water swimming inside the skin is difficult to do that, which raises all the skins of the shoes and therefore causes casses.
In the process of training of a cassis, he says, the first who is slow is the ruling film and only later is affected by the asphalte skin, but the damage has not immediately occurred, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signs with adequate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National System of Investigators explained that the loading of vehicles is another important factor for cassis training and therefore the switch of each pavilion must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction in order to avoid the frequency training of casses.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to invest and work on asfalt, for example, bituminous emblems, which already exists in other countries in the market and allow casses to be resolved easierly and without need to use high temperatures.
What lacked Valle's candidate to be the new Mrs. Columbia?
Analysis of facts that Melina Ramírez Serna did not obtain the coron of Miss Columbia.
Valle receives his title number 14 of princess.
Another Vale del Cauca has remained with the desire to win Ms. Columbia's kroon.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that he was found on the podium of winners, bringing the money krone and the band that accredited it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of Cartagena in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was hired with the coron and sceptre, the sum of 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women of the Valle del Cauca, which were found near the coron, but were proclaimed princess, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Lake Blaque (1988), María Conalesa Pindo (1989), Isabelo Diano (1990), Romana Isabelo (1993), Lorena Aljuna Aljuana, Catalina (Gartalina 2000), Olga Maríana (Garcena).
Today, the great issue that many worlds have is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defect of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had all her to be the new Columbia, because it was not chosen in the winning King of the Police and the best Visage Jolie of Vogue, the titles obtained by the Queens of Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had been imported by Mrs. Columbia.
The first factor considered to be the key in the decision taken by the jury of the first princess is the fact that she has not convinced her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? published by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Literarian Carretta Leamos.
This is the answer of the Chairman of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The little prince," is a very deep book.
Now, I read "Crime and Chastiment" is a universal literature book that we should all read, and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Flower of Blood".
This answer was not first requested because of the term "searing" and, secondly, to not explain exactly how every book mentioned it was.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result of "the universe and the wisdom, it happens what should happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The little prince" is a big book."
Among the launched hypotheses there is that Vale has been destroyed by favoriteism.
A journalist of Bogota instructed that it was the preference, the Sessionary and the candidate who received all the preliminar prices (gagnomy defif of Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal cost, and the Reine Mother), "thela waved the jalousy of the other candidates, stressed the Queen, and that is why she didn't shine on the scene."
And it was noted in his first submission in a bathroom at Hilton's beach and his two defects from the coronation weather.
Although the two challenges she had been safe by her, it was noted that she had not had the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Como home" program (Comme home) of the CNRC Canal said that the fact that Melina was appointed was "confirmed that the candidate who obtains most of the prices during the competition does not receive the king of kings."
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not succeeded to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Concours.
This is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman involved in the social needs of her country.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Columbia, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Concours is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also shown that Valle had sinned by his defects of his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdominal abdominal abdominal, but it is contradicting, as specifically the jury elected it as the candidate "Charlie natural" with the most healthy, good food and physical work.
The captain of Queen Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had not had the best body that there was, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which actually did not have been too well-known for me, left him the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the Kromos magazine considers that the error of the Chairman of Valle had been the surgery interventions that she had taken.
"The surgery is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
Her body has never been herself, and she lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Concours first returned, after the bathroom maillot dismissed, a cruel prediction that was done last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo did to Melina to not give him the guest of the coron.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of government, not as sovereignty, except as princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Concours.
However, she will pass into the story as one of the queens that, despite her slight passage by Cartagena, did not get the coron.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Dactyloscopiste from Cali came to the story like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November, a CTI doctyloscopion in Cali passed to the history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his digital enterprises.
Seven dactyloscopistes working in the CTI local offices this week was the "acceptable" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he often had to pass more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodys should be identified.
The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and following appropriate courses, it was specialized in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against other Alfonso Cano, we had been warned to Eliazar to take with him at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicoptère.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected that one of them was the man who managed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to import the map with the ten digital employees of Guillermo León Sáenz (true name).
But when it happened with the survey team on the part of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical aspect, because it was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He had no barbe, he was shocked as a country of the area, without lunetts and much more mass.
But employees don't lie.
Composed by a galtonic luxury, incredible, a prelevant and a laundry, Eliazar compared the digital loads of the body with the cards.
His eye did not wrong it: he was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who he was the Supreme Chief of Farc.
Search for the printer
For a Dactyloscopist of Sijín of Cali, President Juan Manuel Santos in Eliazar González is very significant in a press conference for the operation against Canada.
Many people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopie is a precise science, without a mistake, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the body, Dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as flight and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their digital employees and search for them in the database.
The investigator said that in a flight case he had to remove a part of a house wall, because in this place the owner had supported his hand to get out of a full coffee of shoes and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to shoot a digital print, but in that case we could get the press of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Employees can also escape or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found with wood bottles around him.
In the course of the investigation, a parent was determined to be suspected of the crime and, in effect, an impairment on the co-incident bottle.
Even if this doesn't guarantee it's the murder, it's the place on the scene of crime.
A CTI doctyloscopic explained that "Digital introductions of objects with chemical or physical reactions" was extracted.
When they appear, a prelevant or a band is used to prelease them.
Afterwards, employees are sent to Asif, the database of decline data, or the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still many colonies without papers," said the CTI experts.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV program.
As all that brilliant isn't gold, everything that it touchs is not forced to make a press.
However, it may be used if the necessary comparison is achieved.
The "inspectors" deplores the authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were shocked before the Zuccotti place to camp there.
A large number of people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighbouring park.
The integrants of the Wall Street movement challenged New York's authorities this Monday by trying to enter again, through a judiciary, on the place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the evil and when they tried to take up another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of manifestants were shocked before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access with a judicial order that allows the "individors" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by employing a park more northern of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again on the place, we're going to install in another place and we'll continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful seats and manifestations," said one of the "Occupation Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray described that the response of the "intelligence" to the evacuation of their camp personally stated by the master of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was reached to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the land and allowed manifesters to stay in the camp.
Moreover, the "intelligence" were employed a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sexth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Church.
At least one hour they succeeded to take care of the place, but after the police moved and stopped some manifestants, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who were also missing.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people were installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved to support members of the movement and tried to interview them before the police.
Among the time, the place Zuccotti, which is a private ownership, remains closed by waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing planned by this march, during which the law of evacuation must be analyzed this morning.
Some moved manifestants have brought and distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and even delivered him to the agents who monitored the place, which caused 'links', said Bray, who declared that some officials had attacked the manifestants.
The judicial order prohibited the authorities to evacuate the Employees of Wall Street or to apply laws published after the start of occupation or to prohibit the manifestants to return to the park with tens or other properties that they had previously used.
The Master Bloomberg stated to the press that, due to this judiciary order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the manifestants, whom he warned that local laws do not allow them to be installed with teeths and sacks to sleep.
The municipal adviser personally defended the evacuation carried out at the place of Zuccotti, a operation in which 200 people were arrested and decided because the manifestants 'dismissed the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do badly to others", because "also some stories had received threats" and the residents had feared "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning to the aube has been repressing and showing that the Broomberg Fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of the American workers," added the movement's door, which condemns the master of "not respect the freedom of expression".
The responsibilities of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "great action" for Thursday in collaboration with Community organizations and trade unions to remind the two months of protest, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Vierge Mary in a special Christmas TV program
On the basis of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will get out in the television program "Thet's at Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", assisted in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", wives of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will be the Vierge Marie in a special program of the Canadian TV.
The CTV private television channel announced today that Anderson, with the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bubllé and other famous Canadians, will come out in the television program "It's at Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December, interviewing a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has now distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the broadcasting on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husbands in that time, the "Mötley Crue" browser, Tommy Lee, appeared like the Vierge Marie, supporting a shoe that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Canadian comédia of Indian origin, recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Near Anderson and Peters, the special CTV Music program also presents the Canadian songer Bublé, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires, the argent model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from disputes.
Recently, Bublé called "put" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earthquake
The GDP increases 1.5 per cent through domestic consumption and ends at the skin skin of the start of mars
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, convasive, after the nuclear devastator of earth that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Nippon country since World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government calculated material losses of $300,000, which seems to have been achieved, despite the difficult global context.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Brut Internal Product between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: the GDP has increased 1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in annualized rates.
This registered the second quarter - for Japanians, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the largest rythm of growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the re-acquirement of equipment to restore the areas discovered by the earthquake and the tsunami poster.
In fact, undertakings increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first recule after six months of non-interrupted growth.
However, the real stimulant of Japan's economy is only based on the key-level impulsion that invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate or rebuilding infrastructures, to use the shortages for zero crossing.
Japan was particularly waved through the development of household consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased 1% of expenditure on vehicles, travels and funding activities.
The yen stigma
Tokio moved to the internal market when yen - nipotamia currency - became one of the "refugee valves" elected by investors who were the debt crisis in the eurozone and the United States predicted problems, a privacy that spends as one of the parts of the exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger division, products are more cherished in the foreign, a serious reverse for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of the large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September the yen cotification.
While the markets continue their seats in the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease guard.
"The risks that continue, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thai infringements and the rapidly appreciation of yen, must be monitored," reported last night the State Secretariat for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) noted that most Member States had presented more clearly the signs of economic decline in September.
The indicator that anticipates the impact points of the global economy has relieved that the main powers are free.
Because it decreased four decimals up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 per cent.
The Eurozone has even been under the average, which is at the level 100, not eight decimals up to 99.13 points.
Athènes renew doubts
Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With the delayed device risks and the reinstalled incertitude in the parks, Greece continues to go into the labyrinth that leads to the great crisis of the debt in Europe.
The sense that the "consensus" of the new hellen transition government is instead imposed by Brussels requirements, but the real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Minister, Lukas Papadimos last night reported that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days set in his appointment could be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, would like to say that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterate the requirement of new elections for the date of February 19th.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the Summit decisions of 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened a Parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a reliable vote for the new executive.
A 24-programme package for encouraging employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiative.
Nevertheless, the message of Samras does not doubt about his position: "We are understood to help the transitional government, but we are not involved in nothing more."
The conservative leader went to a further stage than the EU and FMI, the organizations that have to disbloke the 8.000 million Athene needing urgently, and clearly said that it will not grant any letter of commitment to adjustments.
However, the European Commission, which was still irritated by the imppakt caused by the entire Referendum of Papandreu, reiterates last night that his requirement is strong: it would not debloke the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main hellen parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The Road of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika Inspectors would return to Athene to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranch" of 8.000 million, even if there is no final date.
Greeks still have much to do.
"This are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes the position "representative" of Spain in respect of this type of financing
Spain "having reached a world-wide place in the role of the micro-financing."
The Queen of Sofia recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet for this instrument of cooperation, which is "the essence" in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human beings".
The Reine inaugured the World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the certainty that "no doubt" that this type of operations are "a absolutely essential" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, in particular, "in those who have aimed at reducing the half of the people who live with income under a dollar per day, which is set by the "soul of poverty".
Spain "continued to work" to expand the beneficiary network "in all the coins of the planet, and take this task with "responsibility", reported the Sofia Queen, who hoped that the initiatives and delivery of the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "turn the creation of new capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women," the main beneficiary of these loans.
We've achieved many goals and "we face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum of discussion, but also the platform from which "two basic goals" is required.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million families that have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of these families are out of poverty in which they live now.
The impulsion in the design of micro credits in Spain and the rest of the world "seeked the starting journey a few years ago by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized the Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "excellent idealist in the universal cause of fighting against poverty" the work she had known for 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet its prize policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Côte d'Ivoire Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "to each meeting I could find a continuing evolution", explained its Majesty, whose relationship with this project had brought him the qualified "Felder of Family" meeting in Valladolid from the "poor Bank".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia ended its intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a label emphasis" for all democratic states.
In that sense, she expressed that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered that microcredits would like to “a serious and strict policy for the eradication of poverty”, and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and do not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, the microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "de confidence" to people "excluding the door"; and the master of Valladolid, France Javier León de la Riva, wished to welcome people present in a city which "opens its doors contaminated by the solidarity spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President at universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a lucky, but also President of the Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned to the program, but was imposed in the autom, in particular to satisfy the warriors who judge the policy of the government too laxist in the view of the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted by almost unununity.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten were abstented.
The standing Istion of several minutes to which they had been right, after their interventions, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schauble, the very europhile minister of Finance, did not leave it in doubt.
The idea of happiness - and movement - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "it's not less than Europe but more."
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "9 million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the lucky, "the time came from a lost in Europe."
This could be made by amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enhance the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area, but this could also be discussed on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal sustainability "to give a view to Europe".
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress with which the inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schauble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Sept agree rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is there enemy, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the jail is placed.
Similarly, delegates rejected the proposal to put the weight of each country into the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously return to strengthen the weight of Germany.
Instead of appearing the climate within its party, the chances have multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but has not seen its congress on the two of the "peaces" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe sets a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-Deutly friendship", Angela Merkel did not call France.
Except in crews.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliated defects of the Napoleonian army.
What is fraud for ill stopping?
After the allocations, UNP and the Government launched the offence on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be march 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family rental chain, and to speak about the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of fighting social fraud and assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a will to make economies in a strike context, but is not less proclaiming axis of the presidential campaign right-to-right, most people want to focus on ill stoppings.
First in a goal of budgetary economys, the Government plans to imposing private employees a fourth day of deficit prior to the holding of a job stop.
Of course, without specific company agreement, a employee who is sick would lose four days of payment, so at least 15 per cent of its monthly income.
A measure that may be able to succeed from anger, but that would allow to report 280 million euros, according to the Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: imposing the officials a day of unemployed care in case of labour stop (they have no time of delay, against three days in private).
While these issues are in discussion, the majority also retains the thematics of fraud, targeting the abuses related to labour stops.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will return," warned Xavier Bertrand at the micro of RTL's Sunday 13 November.
As for other cases, advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stops.
It is in effect that since 2002 a constant and political monitoring, which has led most often to their fruits.
Francens are not more sick than otherwise in Europe.
Let us first focus on national figures.
According to the National Insurance Case (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million were delivered in 2006.
According to the Health Research and Documentation Institute, daily compensations represented 5 per cent of health costs in 2008, with EUR 11,3 billion.
On this sum, 46 per cent was concerned with maternity and labour accidents, and 54 per cent were concerned with disease arrests, or 6,2 billion euros.
So 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs met in a mean 14.5 days of work against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A medium that hides some disappearances: another investigation, published in 2007 by the Carrière Management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees were asked to have taken any day of illness.
Another study, this time of the illness assured that in 2010, 37% of disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbors, French employees are not more angry than more than work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that comprehensive absence rates (for health or non-related reasons) were 10 to 11 per cent, against 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud of stopping illness is very little towards black work.
As regards fraud, she reaches only a low width.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes controls systematic on ill stopping over 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285.000 for short-term arrests were "injustified or too long", or 37.050 cases.
In the case of the arrests over 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "inadequated or unjustified" of 1,2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "injustified" cases, in a number of millions of employees who have been arrested by disease.
A number that represents very little face, for example, to the noir work.
According to Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, or more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to these lasts.
Papdemous: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This was what the first minister, Lucas Papademos, said on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his Union government would not be enough to carry out that task.
"To continue the economy's rebuilding efforts, we need to support our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", said the Governing Body, which proclaimed his first public talk in the opening of the debate on the reliable vote to the Mercedes Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new Government, since the participation of the country in the euro area is in play", was added.
Consequently, Mr. Papademos expected that the public deficiency of the country will be reduced "9 per cent" of the GDP at the end of the year, after having been 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Law rejected the new audience measures
Antonis Samaras, the Chief of the Rights, gave Monday its support to the measures already adopted to try out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not be involved in an additional audition.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputy of his party, the New Democracy.
It agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, and combating gaspillage but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who predicted that the FMI and the EU would not disbloke the loan of eight billion euros without a written guarantee of all the parties planned to support the measures. Antonio Samaras answered that his word was sufficient and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
The euthanasis and the assisted suicide must be legalized, said a expert committee
Canadians live in deceased, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together in order to ensure better palliative care, and in addition to cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denix of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about conditions where they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of a substantial report of the Royale Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts related to different areas such as ethics, laws and doctors.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to enable the assisted suicide and euthanasie, when this choice is imposed, to a patient judged to take such decision.
A recent investigation of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has been classified in the 10th century, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to consider the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, report the experts sent by the Royal Society of Canada.
Despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them are finally dead in the hospital.
In the whole country, it is Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86 per cent of the deaths in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasie and the assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are going against the position of the federal government, which has already said to have nothing to change the Criminal Code on Euthanasi and the Assistant Suicide.
But, according to experts, who have also revised all countries where these approaches are legally or described, there is no evidence that this description causes abuse in the application, namely, the practice of euthanasie or self-suicide on non-consentent persons.
On the contrary, he stated in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, the co-signatory of the report, would find more cases of these disruptions in the countries where the euthanasis and the assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian favorable to euthanasie
Let us recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already been proclaimed in favour of the euthanasis because they believe that it would allow people to end their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalization of euthanasie will not be to send the message that the life of old or disabled persons is less valued.
As regards people who practitioned suicide, the sons estimated to 41 per cent that they should not be continued.
The situation is less clear in regard to maintaining or stopping care with a patient, say the authors of the report.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the retrait of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be formed in order to respect the refusal of health care at the end of the life without fear of criminal progress.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together in order to ensure better palliative care, and in addition to cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sediation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasie, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations on the conclusions of the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada's experts.
Me Pierre Deschanmps, a health specialist, has qualified the position of extremely signed experts in the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasie to terminal diseases.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would fail from life and who had more than 18 years could ask for what is helped to kill himself," said Meshanmps, who had consulted a summary of the report last night.
My Descamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social tissue of the society.
But, "in society, it says, there are balls and contrances."
The health specialist Margaret Saturville also expressed "a strong opposition" at the conclusions of the report, which she qualified "manfest pro-euthanasie".
Margaret Saturville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests the data of the report on the absence of abuses in some countries where the euthanasie and the assisted suicide are legalized or in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to leave the power
Ladys call "complete"
Syria is more isolated
A number of Bachar al-Assad partys expressed on the sites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night.
Diplomical pressures have been intensified on the Syrian of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, residing them and denied a "component" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damas, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbor of Syria, took place for a department of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quit the power" in Syria where a 40th of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had a heartfelt interest in his country, he should leave, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, near Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Ahmet Davidoglu, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, deplored that the Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year at the Syrian regime had failed.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and will not be satisfied with them," he stated, being allusioned in Syria, nearby countries regarding which Turkey adopts a more harder line.
The United States welcomed the "reforcing the consensus against Assad and the action of the regime" after the decisions of the Arab Ligue and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are taking a lot more harder towards the repression in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a parliamentary port of the department of State.
During that period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces died in the Deya region, in the south of Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians lost the "lors of thieves and piloting to the heavy mills in Jobar" in the Homs settled town, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem considered that the country “it was heading to the end of the crisis”.
He also reacted very much to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damas of his work, which is, according to him, "a dangerous step".
The Syrian "no flying," he added, assuring that "noise compliments against Syria will disappear".
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for Civil Protection" and wants to send 500 Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alan Juppé also said favorable to send observers of the United Nations to help citizens to protect the repression of the regime, which, according to him, is sick in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary League meeting is planned tomorrow in Rabat to address the implementation of the Crisis Outcome Plan decided on 2 November and, in particular, for the retirement of the military forces of the cities for the contestation and release of the arrested manifestants.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged last night the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis plan, while looking for supporting possible sanctions against Damas.
ITALIA
Monti request for time to markets and sacrifices in Italy
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, requested a little time for markets to form its team and implement a program that will contain "foods", to restore the lost credibility in the past months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties last night before meeting the trade unions and patrons.
It should establish a relatively limited office composed of external technocrats in the Parliament.
"Monti spoke of a important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in entertainment, after having met the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputy, Gianfranco Fini, said for his part, is expecting that Mario Monti calls for sales of trust in Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded by Mr. Monte of a restricted list of ministers at the Head of State, Jorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousity of the boursiers and binding markets last, as they requested time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, it stressed, "certified that the markets will be patients and will understand".
His appointment was initially congratulated by the markets, but the concern was repeated in particular after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The First Minister should be a team that is particularly technocrats, even though he emphasized that it would like to include "political policies".
The new government must duration until 2013, date of the next legislatives, was estimated.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputy, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the confidence of the Parliament from Thursday.
Mr. Monti has been able to work in an emergency and the purpose that Italy "revenne protagonist" in Europe.
The European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speaking port stated that "herself with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget balance in 2013, despite the recent months of austerity plans adopted, requested, in particular, new rigorous measures.
The "patrone of the patrons" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it march, also stressed the need to re-establish the economy, "for a country that has no growth can not respect the parameters of deficit".
Mr. Monti, represented for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolized by "the challenge of serious" and "other Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown will be the long-evity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid previous elections, since Italy must place from April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientific helped Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientific, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a useful detonator with nuclear weapons, argued Monday a American NGO specialized in the nuclear risk.
The International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the United Nations Agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA has been part of his "severe concerns" last week about a "posible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, largely powerful in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades in a Soviet Military Military Centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural) and had been involved in the manufacturing of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company produced by "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company had led to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iran programme 1996-2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA said "weight indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system " had been helped by the work of a foreign expert, which was not only aware of this technique, but that, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the essential career on this technology within the military programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Muslim crimes and crimes increased from about 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while in the same time other racial and religious violences have slightly slowly or little progress, according to the FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims was 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent of increased, against 13 per cent of the violence against Catholics, a decline of 4 per cent of Jews crimes and a global increase in 14 per cent of religious crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has been lowly increased in 6 628 cases, which 47.3% motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"Besides a decline in 2009, it is difficult to see these crimes and crimes to increase again", said the Human Rights Organization First, "the increase in anti-musulman violence is particularly significant", added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the responsibilities of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American Government may and must do more to attack these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be through a improvement of the police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the Federal Law of America is a heritage of the time of the fight for citizens' rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish race violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual perception.
Twitter changes his platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced lunch changes in the presentation of its platform, in order to enable its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes it a little more like his service as Facebook.
A new "Activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more liablely, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the interface that follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows to know if they follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter form was tested "to a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed throughout the Sunday Network, AFP reported the Twitter port Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinctive function, with some somewhat so-called terms (RT to redistribute a message of someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiatives, will also open a broader public with a more comparable manuscript of the larger Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users discussed the interest of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, invasive, and it seems too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"Actionality will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter flux," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a 'or rules' in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social-Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to include a 'good rules' in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficiencies and thus avoid possible degradation by the sovereign note agencies of Austria (trip A).
It is the social-democratic publisher Werner Faymann who even announced this decision on the outcome of a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly under the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was only one crane, from AAA to AA+, we should pay $3 billion more than each year," said the Chairman and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus requested a summit in Brussels of the Member States of the euro area of 26 October: Heads of State and Government had then requested the registration of this end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficit and of a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a same value law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the German model, Germany, which was the first European country to adopt such a "regule".
Since 2017, structural public deficit should be reduced each year by 0.75% of the bruto domestic product (IBP) and from 2017 the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, while regional States and communities should present balance budgets.
The objective is to go to the 2020/21 public debt under the criteria of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned march that the Nipon authorities would be re-interviewed on the market if yes had to continue to move.
"We're going to come as we did last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen change rate, Mr. Noda in Senate explained.
Mardi, the yen was not far from the historical levels imposed by the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo has sell yens against dollars in order to increase the value of the nipoan rate that had come to establish a new force record since 1945 faced the green ticket.
But yen has been regularly retired since, as a result of buyers of investors who consider it as a "floor refugee" in those incertain times of global economic decline and indecent crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passing march under the 77 yens, and the euro is decreased under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, near the levels that have started the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yens and the euro more than 160 yens.
This flambling of nipota for the exports of the archipel because it decreases the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income by the Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan fight to rebuild" from the seed and the tsunami of 11 March that defeated the Tohoku region (norest), stressed Mr. Noda who fears that this yen rebuilding does not kill in the eye of the frozen egg.
The third global economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the rebond of exports and the consumption of households consumpted by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that yen's wealth was not reflected by "the basic economic elements of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called the Japan Bank (BoJ), which opened a meeting of two days of his monetary policy advisory, to take all possible measures to defeat the yen.
But the Ad hoc Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting to hear that no additional monetary abbreviation had been expected to march.
During its last meeting in October, the Emission Institute increased 5,000 billion yens (47 billion euros) its goods purchase from the Tresor, which passed up to 55,000 billion yens (519 billion euros), the amount of the amounts which it offers to the purchase of different financial titles to include the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the rates broken, the bourrees flanching
The risk of accounting for debt crisis is always undermining European indexes.
Despite the designation of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to be ascensed.
The European Burundis are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, and the European Burundis are a little more focusing on the negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10:00, the CAC 40 lost 1,4% to 3.064 points.
The Francfort Date is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new pressures on the income of the euro area's loans, actions markets over the world continue to make a part of their recent profits. "
"Investors, nervous, are not just aware of the risk of contagion, " explains Terry Pratt, institutional courtier at IG Markets, referred to by the Reuters Agency.
Tokio Bourse slowed 0.7 per cent, suffering from the renewed fear of market intervenants in Europe's capacity to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, as the rest of the world, has the eye of Europe and the exchanges will continue in a close variation course so that investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized, " said Mitsushige Akino, generating funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This result of concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the unique currency, which continues to be decreased.
The euro has developed at its lower level for a month and half.
By 10 a.m. the European rate is $1.3570, in reply of 0.4%.
According to the curriculums, she reaffirmed that the party of the Chairman Angela Merkel, the DDC, was meeting at Monday Congress, adopted a movement, including the possibility for a country in difficult to get out of the euro area without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates over 6%
The payment rates of Italy and Spain remain a very worried level.
On Monday morning, the revenue of Italian obligations to 10 years up to 6,85%, the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6,2%.
These trends on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France continue to feed the fears of intervenants.
The chief of the future Italian government Mario Monti requested time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatening asphyxis by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is located in the market view line, while there are legislative elections in the country on Sunday.
The rate difference ("expread") between the ten years of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historic higher.
In expectation of the growth rates of the euro area
Statistical costs, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, or a little better than 0.3% expected by household consumption.
However, Insea revised the number of the second quarter, with a recule of 0.1% of the gross domestic product instead of a stagnation.
And this is really the fourth worried about the economists.
Germany has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first estimation for the whole euro area is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has taken place against the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
the facts must import it on dogmes
If it is a subject that cannot be treated from short-term considerations or under emotion, it is well the energy policy.
The availability and the cost of electricity are directly influenced on the purchase power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is sacred that an electoral make is the opportunity to reflect such enemy and the place where the nuclear is holding.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The Frenchs must based their views on objective facts, reasonable data.
While we are seven billion humans on the planet, "democratic evolution" will lead to double the demand of electricity from here to 2050, less to pursue a major part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the rareration of fossil resources should be paid to continue to produce constant electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce emissions of slow gas to combat climate deregulation, a disappeared subject of the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to reject nuclear.
This is not the case or Belgium, which submits the need to be able to find a source of replacement that can be replaced, or Switzerland, which is just to build only centrals of the last generation.
Instead, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to continue their projects with a determination.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add a unit to their park by re-building the construction of an interrupted central after the accident of Trie Mile Island.
If the German model, aimed at renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality opposes the talk.
The choice of Berlin will be translated by renewing the electricity price, an energetic dependance aggregated by the increased gas resource imported, in particular in Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions affected by the construction of gas and carbon centrals.
In a few months, the whole of these weak effects is already feeling.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
It is also one of the most larger carbon and gas users from the wind intermitting; in this regard, CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Instead, thanks to the relevance of our energy policy, our neighbors obtain a factor of electricity more than 40% than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the energy cost is a key factor of competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit the most loved electricity in Europe.
Indeed, any significant reduction in the nuclear would generate a strong increase in electricity price, which would illusory the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frenchs refuse to pay, as they do not express a principle opposition to this energy, the reviews show it.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build a industrial company of 125.000 direct jobs and 410.000 induit jobs.
Fortunately exporting, it leads to a specialized KMU galaxy on international markets and makes them very non-localised job creators.
If France decided to get out of the nuclear, it would offer many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion annual euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical order would an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
To solve the "energical equation" must be acknowledged that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, no longer than there is diabolic.
The development by Areva of low emission solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the supplementary of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a Security Authority in France that exercises an untransparent and transparent control on existing centres like Flamanville's channel.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are living in the same obsession of security.
In a half century, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One only, three Mile Islands, has been involved in normal exploitation conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Cchernobyl, the design of reactor and unharmonised human faults caused the drame.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results of two natural disasters of an unforeseen wheel that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will bring the teachings of this accident, as it had done for the two previouss.
Through this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that is capable of resisting such phenomenon.
While it is considered by all electrics to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Arva and EDF, leaving their free way to prevent leadership in the uncontrolled nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy cluster for our country, but it would be irresponsive to leave the emotion, dogmes and the partisan hands to dominate a determining debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under several Englishs - the enforcement of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of "Human Rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harvest of which foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of Interior (Living of 23 May) proclaimed the pass that France "no need for foreign talents, mazes and restaurant servers."
But she is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a sufficiently large consensus between the left and the right.
Rightly, you were given by Jacques Chirac, who would state in 1976 that "9,000 unemployers should not be a problem in a country that includes almost 2 million immigrants", and on the left, Michel Rocard explaining that France "not can welcome the whole poverty of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by pools was shared on the left as right.
For both borders, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be harmed for immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland cantonates, indicating that the co-development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electrically paying; but it is very economically costful.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalls in a recent work that synthetics the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a large consensus among immigrant experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, salary and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict immigration to employment growth and night.
The fear of the impact of migrants is based on the idea that those may be replaced to national workers, particularly the poorly qualified, experience a low pressure on their salary.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than they are replaced by national employees, which are essentially employees in employment sectors.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow employment offer.
Positive effects on salary
As a surgery will work in a country who knows a lack of anxiists, these supplements between national and migrants make that immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on salary and employment of nationals.
John Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows leads to an increase in 0.6 to 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (frequent proportion of immigrants among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributions of social systems, at average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization considers that a immigrant who arrives in the age of 30 will provide net contributions (minor expenditure) of 150000 euros to public budgets in the whole life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to go looking for the lack of growth.
The dentists concerned, in order to dissuade immigrants, had the exact effect of the inverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European Continent should be able to remember that, for inventing it in Athens over two thousand years ago, the tragédies of the Great War, totalitaryms, the Holocaust, the Goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies in Greece.
Some believed that it would be enough, so that triomphate democracy would endure its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon the Petit, that he was here with a thinking facility.
The universal demand, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be "oppression instrument" as the Republicn philosoph Etian Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarities, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is a economic crisis, but it is so much and first a crisis of policy and democracy.
The paleody of the true-falendum Greek would have been a double reveler value in this regard: the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also the feeling of its impossibility, its incompliance.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceededed.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight have now been moved, and that, for many of them, the Republicn soldiers have no longer shooted in the good direction.
We have nothing to win to require a national referendum subsequent, organized in accordance with the needs and dispersed order.
A white-sein at the absolute European monarch or a leg-sheet in the empty of the nationalist reply: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to cut out but a common exercise of full-legal, seren and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - no more will be known where to stop the "unumance" - because there is only a crisis and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that increases the market dictates and notation agencies, which depends on its imputence and lack of solidarity.
It's all Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.
We are worried about sovereignty transfers to Europe - but it's all Europe that has deeply lost his sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
The urgency is to return to the popular sovereignty to the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, to free markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of crisis will take decisions at the European level that will not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except surely to lead us to disaster.
After long struggle with this proposal of socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone today claims the European Economic Government.
Call it.
But thinking of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as by citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To do the Republic in France, the Republic failed to do the Republicns.
Revolution in interest could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic level.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To do Europe, we do Europeans.
The pocket cards are generally
The world card room opens on Monday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a optimistic climate.
In 2011, there should be an increase of 11% of global microprocessor card sales (bank card, SIM phone...) and more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart Office.
The most powerful segment is the of the technologie without contact that allows paying the transports in common or regulating its purchase by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold around the world, against 320 million a year ago!
Their share should still be progressed in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent almost 10 per cent of the global card market (6.925 million cards).
Long-term in the Asian-Pacific region, Europe wins the field for the free- contact payment.
About 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment finals accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double legs.
Carrefour has thus issued this year 2,5 million cards Pas MasterCard without contact.
To cross the higher speed, the banks must now be equipped with their customers.
"The large French institutions have been able to distribute systemically to their customers of banking cards equipped for without contact," announces Gérard Nebouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But it's only a first step towards the future payment means mobile phone.
Many of the devices are currently equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) to perform operations.
"They took a late."
"But they should finally know a real shore the next year."
"We tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in the world in 2012," Marc Bertin explains, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
Agricultural credit has announced last day the launch of a December test next to June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a school that authorises the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said to prepare the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is extended
Paris was concerned about the links between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sect.
A long-term suspected link between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect.
Thursday, Abdelkader Messahel, the Algerian Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, even claimed that Alger is now "acquire certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation", it explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation of two French people in Niger in January would have been on the passing day.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by nearby Aqmi, Antoine of Leocorur and Vincent Delory were to be killed on the same morning as several of their visitors during a operation launched by French special forces.
In the outcome of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones belonging to terrorists.
Terror axis
The analysis of the calls passed to several interlocutors based on Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in investigators: one of the Nigers who had long stayed in Mayduguri, a northern city of Nigeria, Boko Haram and one man who is close to Aqmi and Secte.
"It's an advanced, but it must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"Mas it's possible."
"We know for years that the seventh benefits from external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," Temple Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "subsidys" were increasingly clear in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now implies the use of mixed or explosive engines more complexly and the same facture as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, made pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the group as a community of unfair interests.
Quick success
Funded in 2002 to Mayduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram, which means "the Western Education is a sin" - puts the establishment of a Islamic Emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is political and requires strict respect of the chariot while its warriors strictly struggle against the unclean central government.
These are first seeing churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, the militarys of Boko Haram are particularly active, multipliing the attacks against the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, like his habit, without nerves.
The army investes the city, on account of 800 deaths.
Mohammed Joseph, alive arrest, was killed in prison.
Since the seventh will radicalize and leave his fifths from the north.
In the last Christmas, she returned an attack that made 80 deaths to Jos, and then another to Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the police security QG at a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local seat will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would be shipped from Mauritania to Somalia by passing through Nigeria now all security experts.
While Aqmi invested the Mali and the Niger, the Somalians of Al-Chababa opposed in Kenya, Boko Haram appeared as a new threat to the continent's heart.
Last week, at an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé was guarded against Boko Haram and said "to share all information."
The world according to the Republicn candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry revalise simplism and misconsciousness.
Can an African American manage a complex world with simple, simple ideas or ideas?
The elections could believe by listening to the Presidents of the Republic.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tonitorous statements and the raising of foreign policy, traditionally a strong republical point.
On China, on Iran, on the aid to Israel, the slogans - often not staged - smoke.
Mitt Romney, the best placed at the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to visit Chinas in front of WTO and to put them into question "for the manipulation of their currency", a porteur theme in a America exacerbated by the migration of the entire industry to Asia.
So if this should include the deployment of a commercial war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador in China d'Obama, and only a candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to face a "flate" attitude to emotions.
He called to a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the sondages, remains unaudious.
On the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military shocks on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm gonna stop Iran, it's fancified."
"If Obama is re-selected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accused of Obama to defeat his obligations against this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best candidate, shows an unconsciousness of the dossiers.
Recently, he called on to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pekin "shaped to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has the military atom since 1964!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to shoot against Iran, said he was ready to join the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The appeal to torture against presumed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also predicted by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a weight in foreign policy.
The opposites of the current president claim that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he wins the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in the field of anti-terrorism.
They insist with reason on the failure of his naif dialogue with Iran, on the too preceding start of the "boys" of Iraq, on its third-party in Libya, which is thus a low label.
But the attack isn't so aggressive.
The population is very positive to Obama's national security balance, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it is misunderstanding of military interventions leading to education.
And by argumenting that America must be reconstrued in economically to restore its leadership, Obama is more fair.
North Stream, the new Russian Gas Gas gate door in Europe
The North Stream gas, linking the Western Europe directly to Russia, crossing the Baltic Sea, went into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gaiser, wanted to celebrate the event with eclat.
More than 500 guests with four heads of State and Government participated on the borders of the Baltics, between orchester and buffet final, at North Stream's inauguration, the new gas that directly links Russia to the sea in Germany.
Similarly, the German happier Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Filon and his Homolog of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, turned together the flight of the Russian gas in the Western European network.
With this new gas, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubes will be reached each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km from the Saint Petersburg region in the Mecklemburg country.
A second tube must be finished at the end of 2012, with a view to delivering up to a total of 55 billion meters of gas cubes, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And there is already the possibility of building a third on the same way.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this great chanter has winning airs.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Balts countries.
North Stream will actually allow free of gas directly in Germany, avoiding any land passenger through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lost their power: it is more difficult to pes on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
In the strongest debate, Varsovia was not able to compare the North Stream to a " new German-Soviet Pact " in reference to the Hitler and Staline Alliance for Employing Poland in 1939.
This is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting this Russian project, gained a greater security from its supply.
But it is on the price of energy failure, since the project has created a breach between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has learned in five years to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose legislation are declined.
"This gasoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that is organicly linked to us, " confirmed François Filon by inauguring this gasoduc, demonstrating how many guest contracts are also political and economic.
This explains the large smiles shown by Gazprom leaders, present in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas is also a technical exploitation.
The sub-marin tube is in skin winned skin to protect it against ships' ancres.
It is on the bottom of the sea, at a medium 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was unable to avoid mines fields from the Second World War.
" One hundred had to be taken or destroyed, by caution, " states Jens Muller, the parliamentary port of North Stream society.
It was also necessary to multiplie the measures to protect fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, weighing like 242 Eiffel tours, which nothing stops over all its length: nor valve, nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned throughout Sweden, but the responsibilities of the project were denied while the Sweden was unwanted to see a Russian State society remained permanently throughout their costs.
"In the case of a disappearance, we stop the gas over in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
In the case of flight, gas in the gas is therefore escaped in the air.
But this case is not likely to be judged by the constructors who planned the slaughter to know a fleet every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the state of gas is assured by a under-sea robot, driven by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circle inside the gas.
With the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a diameter, and it is put by the gas.
At the arrival, after three full days of travel at 3 meters second, it books specific information on the events of metal deformation.
The gas was designed to operate for 50 years without having to deal with the lower reparation.
Gas movement is simply assured by pressure.
It's from 200 bars at the start, and from 100 to the arrival.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the parts.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5%) and the Dutch Gasunia and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company named North Stream to build and operate the gas.
She has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then lovered this company, for twenty-renewable years, the total of gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, except the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Muller.
The financing of gas construction was 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be reached by 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, since only Gazprom is risked.
The Baltic gas is embarrassed in Lubmin, on a sweet sandy litter planted with pins.
Valves, high of 4.5 meters, form the gas outdoor.
Senators measure the pressure, temperature and the specifications of the gas that arrive, before it be transferred to the German gas.
Since spring, this terminal receives a million meters of Russian gas cubes every hour that pass.
In full capacity, there will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a mark book.
The Moleskine wants to repay the pledge of the writing about a 15-year-old Italian company.
He has a parfum of adventures, time past to write to the light of a bug.
The Moleskine book is easyly acknowledged, with its black rectangular cover, his elastic, its white-warm sheets, as old as the time.
However, the Moleskine book is born today... in 1997.
The Italian Mode company, based on Milan, decides to start a design but separated book.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launching of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the skin mol (skin skin pee) which designates a vernis coton used to cover banks for example.
This type of book was very taken by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine was a old and forgotten object, which was a icon of the preguarded artists, until the XX and the century," says Mary Sebregondi, who became responsible for the brand in Mode.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to 12.7 million parts.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports in 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robotic portrait of the buyer, because the note book also deduced the businessman and the students and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open of mind and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which has 12 employees at its starts, has now been at least 100 and has two offices since 2008, and one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops of center-ville and imposed its identity.
"We followed the atmosphere of time and this new writing need, despite e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signing complies with the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has started an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists are exposed to their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the festival of Locarno film.
With its success and cultural will, Moleskine has differentiated its products: sacs, agenda, styles, computer woods... The brand turns to a whole range of supports.
A succeeding success: On Monday 2006, Mode was redeployed by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, today Sintegra Capital, which wrote a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of persons with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is two times higher than average: 19 per cent, against 9 per cent for the whole population.
Awesome?
"No, emphasizes Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities. "
" The progress made for 15 years is considerable. "
" At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
"But there is still much to do."
It is necessary to say that for disabled unemployed people, obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are less older: 37% have more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a less higher qualification level: 80% do not have bags and 2,3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very large: 53 per cent for disabilities, against 38 per cent in average.
The same criteria that individually comply with the return to employment and which " represents the weakness of the problem " , According to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, a association established in 1992 to help enterprises to recruit disabled workers.
This is for goals.
It remains the non-dit, the mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Introduction Association indicated that the questionned managers had " a weak level of knowledge of disabilities " with a " overrepresentation of routine chaise persons, psychological or intellectual deficiencies " .
As a result, private enterprises of more than 20 employees are still far to achieve the goal of 6% of disabled employees in a legislation of 1987.
The latest known figures, which are in 2008, are a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3 per cent", states Peter White, Director-General of the Agefif, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The evidence is: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, reduced between 2007 and 2011, with 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Legislature, which increased the contributions, made a strong pressure on business, explains Peter White. "
"But this improvement also translated a real conscience, especially in the major groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the 20 to 49 employees are employed with disabled workers, against 82 per cent of the employees from 100 to 199 employees.
"The Happiness of Happiness"
Before faced the Bleus Monday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the joy they're looking for this friendly match.
We're not going to write that there was conviction among them, but the image is symbolic.
Coast-coast seat on the street of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have done peace well.
Five months after the smooth of his attacking against Turkey, the Belgian selectioner has only ices to do about it.
"I am very pleased of Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go from the front," assure Lillois on his side.
With regard to the contrast between its performance in club and selection, "It's a whole, if he is justified."
"A Lille, I'm all the year, what isn't the case with Belgium."
"I need to take my brands."
Employed against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis finally "briller".
Nevertheless, the idea of "pleasing".
The Bleus encouraged them since the age of seven and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he says.
Force, this is involved in increasingly strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
As far as face, " there's Matthieu (Debooky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he slaughtered.
"We believed at the time."
"You can play against them, it's just happiness!"
With bonomy, Leekens has been calling "lovery".
"Feace" to controverse a gala match.
"Feace" also to find - in the quality of "vosin" - that France has become a very high-level team" a few more than one year after Knysna's traumaism.
"Laurent White did a tuner work", he was encouraging.
While Belgium lacked the next euro, the technicist would be well shared with the blue direction... Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians become great," he stressed.
"We're in building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll take you into account at the next matches." This is against France including.
Portugal very confidenced
Portugal, Paul Bento, with many optimists, has turned back to Bosnia (22.00 p.m.), this march in Lisbon.
On the other hand, the two teams missed reality.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, in particular, a happy country."
Paul Bento is already seeing in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selectceo, which is at the hands since September 2010, will be qualified for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and a opposer, Bosnie, to break up.
As the match went (0-0), he seemed to be not done in Zenica's hell.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than one hour, certainly, but it was unable to mark this so precious purpose, which would have emphasized it.
"It's a good result, however, that constitutes a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside"
But in their luminous stage of Luz in Lisbon, the Portugies are convinced to pass, before a public who should be there as well, even though the party is obviously announced " very sweet ", he has a ten optimistic, but lucide Bento.
"We're waiting for a very sweet match, but we're absolutely convinced that we can take it above, " said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% chances to be at Euro 2012," even related to Carlos Queiroz's poster.
The none reported from Bosnia obliges the Portugies to mark and win.
A Null can be sufficient to the Bosnians, which they also need to mark.
"This is a good result, however, that constitutes a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has many players with a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, Portugal will have the intention of putting up a maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order to " not " give them the time to reflect " .
A good idea, provided to show reality, this time.
