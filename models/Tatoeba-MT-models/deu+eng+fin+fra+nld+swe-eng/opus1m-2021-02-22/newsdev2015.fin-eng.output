Changes in business support practices - Province - Regions - News - Karelian
In addition to EU business aid, the management of national business aid will also be concentrated in four ELY centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, South Savo's Ely Centre in Mikkeli is responsible for its operations.
According to the new Enterprise Aid Act, which entered into force in July, EU Structural Fund aid may no longer be targeted at large companies unless it is entirely new.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also listed as large municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support will continue to be available for investments that improve the economic conditions of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national aid management unit will have a strength of around 30 people.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work in their current offices.
For example, Kalevi Pölösen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Southern Savo Ely Centre, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This Russia now strives for in Ukraine
Russia works consistently, even if it doesn't always look like it.
Governor Torsti Siren, head of the Department of Defense Strategy, did not surprise the conflicting news from Ukraine on Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine is telling us that its parachute forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank division near Luhansk airport, and that the tank division has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in the Minsk negotiations without conditions.
Russia is arguing that it is involved and must immediately have the outcome of the negotiations so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole story, Siren says.
This is the big picture: we must suddenly start negotiating and specifically so that Russia gets its own grip on the areas of Luhanski and Donetski.
Finnair externalizes travel services to the Norwegian company, dismisses people
Finnair starts to buy passenger services as a subcontract from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will initially cover the routes to Hong Kong in Finnair and Singapore, but will be extended later.
In Finland, the exit of two routes leads to a reduction in the number of persons employed in the first phase of the year, which the company reported in its press release.
In addition, some 80 Asian rental workers will end their work at the time the routes are cleared.
Finnair already told us in June that it plans to outsource some 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
The missions were concluded when no agreement was reached with the staff on savings.
The releases are scheduled to begin in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. stroke, for those who engage in heavy exercise.
The study of the occupational health department monitored firefighters for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders with squamous pain is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of the firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not appear to be protective, says the director of the study, Sirpa Lusa, in the report of the occupational health department.
Firefighters work is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the surprising new causes of water damage?
Causes of destruction in other homes
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by leaking pipes or pipes, reminds the host association expert.
We have been contacted when the breach of the aquarium has caused water damage in the house company, that it is possible to ban aquariums, says Marina Furuhelm, Law Officer of the Host Union.
Furuhjelm points out that only pipes and sewers are not the common cause of water damage, but that, today, more and more new machines such as ice-burning machines have caused water spills in homes.
Many do not know that machinery such as a washing machine or a washing machine must not be left unattended.
It must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, otherwise the pressure in the pipe may lead to water leaks.
A resident may be considered to have been guilty of negligence if such obligations have been neglected, where liability for damages is incurred by the resident.
Of course, in these cases home insurance can compensate for damages, depending on the conditions of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused damage in a carefree manner, the resident shall be liable for the damage.
If the resident has run out of the shower on the floor of the mine, neglect can often be proven, as in these cases the water has usually flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the disabled resident is found.
Furuhjelm tells us that as a result of the proliferation of underground mines, two underground mines have now been installed in the shower facilities in many student dwellings.
Water damage has also caused water beds, although not to the extent that they were more popular.
Even the dog's water cup and the fall of the house winery can become real water damage.
I also know a case where there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so that there was widespread damage, Furuhjelm tells.
The principle of responsibility for repair always goes in the same way unless otherwise stipulated in the company's articles of association.
The shareholder shall be responsible for the repair of the surface material and the damage to the building company's structure as well as for the damage to other dwellings.
Water damage causes easy destruction to other homes, because the structure of the concrete absorbs water.
Furuhjelm says that the batteries in the apartments are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily leaked into the structures.
Water damage can now lead to an increase in air heat pumps producing condensate water.
Water should lead to solid wastewater or rainwater networks, not just containers.
The shareholder is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, counseling the lawyer.
Furuhjelm advises that, although the rules of the household company do not require, for example, a fixed removal hose with washing machine, the insurance can be a condition for the compensation to be not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policies.
However, I think that the washing machines are loose, for example, water drain pipes, as a major risk, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the exit doors should always be firmly directed to the sewer pipe.
Snow and water removal in the balcony
Monitoring of washing machines, washing machines etc., when they are on.
Sealing of water shells (washer and dishwasher)
Floor mine cleaning is visible twice a year.
The recommendation is to connect the removal doors firmly to the sewer.
Check the ducts and any leaks they may have
Regular freezer dilution
Do you have experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in the commentary?
FC Honka lost again and lit up as a serial jumbo
At Tapiola Sports Park on Sunday night, two weakest teams of this moment’s team met a football team.
FC Honka, who celebrated the last victory in June, hosted seven games in the winning pipeline of the Vasa Palloseura.
The VPS just took his previous win against Honka in July.
The meeting with the Espoo team on Sunday became a good match, as the VPS returned from a long time to the position of 2-1.
Olli Huttunen, head coach of the Vaasas, complained about the inefficiency of his team before the game, but the confused Honka defense made VPS’s goal problems easier.
Playfully very nervous performing.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we didn't get a ball," Huttune estimates his own performance.
In the first half of the year, Honga's top archbishop Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a very uncertain way.
Both goals were created as a result of the loose play of the tops.
The opening goal of the game was only seen after a five minute game, when Steven Morrissey directed the shoot by Sebastian Strandvall, a fooled Honka goaltender, Walter Viitalan.
I'm sorry about the first half-time.
By the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," shefki Kuqi manas, Honga's main coach.
After the initial impression, the Esponians got their game together and turned the ball on the attack head.
Carlos Portela and Roni Porokara, in particular in the middle field, eagerly applied for shelters, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The nearest target was Honga's midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot, however, was slightly past the VPS target.
The VPS was effective in fighting their attacks, using a fast-paced top partner from Hong Kong.
At half an hour, the veterans made a 2-0-sum when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through two times.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on the right-hand side of the game during the opening period and created situations from the left on a regular basis.
Stewart's speed, again, seemed to be too much for the polar defense throughout the game.
"At half-life, if you lose, then you lose with honor," Kuqi told.
In the second episode, Honka, who was a member of the family, was furiously looking for a thinning paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt was successful.
The striker, Yerai Vilaboa, finished the paint in the middle of the penalty zone.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to strike the match.
The Espoo team increasingly took more risks, allowing VPS to respond to dangerous attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got on their way with Viitala, but Honka-paintings were playing with the home team.
For the rest, Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any extra paint.
As a result of the killing, Honka was the last to light up the league with seven more matches left.
Magazine: Putin’s body could take over Kiev in two weeks
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin had a very tough telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed annoyance at the European Union's plans to intensify sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take over Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells Putin what he said.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: It is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave an interview to the Russian TV channel on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
In the interview, Putin told us that he was holding the conflict fully within Ukraine and that he was calling on the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about firing civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't look next door" if people are shot to death from the nearest distance," Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The work of the actor destroyed the family
The hard work of Konkarian actor and theatre girl raised recognize how the actor profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor, Esko Roine, will be celebrating the next Friday of 70 years, but in his case, I think it's a saying that age is just a number.
I can't tell any difference compared to a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
A mental puberty seems to be continuing, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but he's still working for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was joked that there are not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roineella has a role to play in Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in a difficult business, in Tampere's Labour Theatre's Mental Discipliner and in Tampere's Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Rappäösä film.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
The red actor didn't start a promising career.
I wasn't good enough at school for the diner picture.
40-50 years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't give up.
The choice of career was clear, and there were no options.
It seemed close and dear.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and volunteered in the army just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre screenings and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If they count jobs like the English, that every part of the TV series is their own show, then the TV stuff is over 600.
I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
The next spring, I was killed when there was no time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko's big sections Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and do Tampere's Workforce Theatre in a show of wild roles as anarchy.
Little brother's gonna be on stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about the age of this.
I always have to take a small reservation that I'll be here if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've left a man for years, too.
You're not going to be alone.
The knees are operated on, the hip whirls and the arthropod troubles, but when it doesn't allow too much interference, yes, with these let go, Esko Roine says.
For example, Roine became familiar to the TV audience.
From the pirate radio and from a show where he and Antti Einio shared hundreds of hundreds of marks of banknotes.
It was Antti Einiö, who was distributing crops.
I was trying to guess that they were crops and not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a cowardly Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became a favourite of Tampere police officers, at the facility, when he happened to be an equal lieutenant.
A police officer stopped the car on the street, took the window open, and yelled at me, "It's a great iron rock!"
Task Force Successful
From theatre to theatre, Roine has remained in mind, for example.
Producer of the Helsinki City Theatre and Master's Class, Death of the Tampere Worker's Theatre Business Traveler and Long Day journey to the Night of Tampere Theatre.
Everyone has to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's the task force that's done it.
We've come up with a lot of rhymes, too.
Pekka Puupä's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed to it too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result is neither self nor viewers satisfactory.
As a line actor, you can't choose your own work.
It's just that it's been nice to do what's been told.
Besides the theater girl, Roine has tried to succeed in business as well.
In the 80's he liked a restaurant called the Wanhat Romaneot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It was nothing at all when I tried to be the director of Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then a food writer.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that these cannot be reconciled at all.
It was typical that when the show was over or in the middle of time and I had time to think if I could put on the sauna, the restaurant was called to say that there are your friends here who would like to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On her birthday, Esko Roine will be showing me memories, ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of a circle they've created from the face-blower's memories.
At the time, when I was playing Zoom, they called me a face-blower.
They didn't know me by name.
The book's been made for years.
Back in the day, Roine told me that no news bomb has been promised, because she hasn't done anything so heavy, or if she is, she won't tell.
I made the book a little original.
I'm saying that if anyone waits for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading here.
There's a lot of professional stuff in there, so as an actor when he's the director of the theater.
The coroner calls out that there is also a tour of the awesome theatre schoolmate.
It was a pretty normal student life, but the kid was made of everything.
It wasn't as wild as it was at the time of Turka.
It was very different.
I don't know how much I got from there except for the confidence that when the school has gone so far, it won't be up to it if it doesn't heal.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I had gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I made friends with Pentti Simes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen, and I got to work with them.
I mean, there were legends there from my first appo from Kararlo Halttus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was with me at the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttusen.
As a pain in the ass, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long fight, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that she went to my mother and son.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I think the children agree in some way now as adults.
It is not uncommon in theatre circles for silver to be divided.
In our case, some part was that I worked quite a lot at the time.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was the TV and the radio on it.
I had a long day and a family life.
The day of the party, maybe at night.
Esko Roine celebrates in Tampere's Labour Theatre with a protester on 7 September.
The celebration will continue at Helsinki City Hall on 21 and 28 September.
You know, the devil in your mind, he's got a gut out there, too.
I was five and six and ten at work.
When such an easy - to - move play happened, I thought that now that the seven-tenths of a century are held, they will get away with one rhythm.
Roineen says there's no party on the actual birthday.
I mean, I remember it's a free night, but I'm not going to swear.
Maybe I've been bugging some gig that day.
Or it's a strange night off that I'm going to keep on the night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom are concerned that supply chain capacity problems may detract from the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Great Britain, thousands of companies in the production chain of aircraft are currently enjoying the unexpected amount of aircraft and engine development plans to be carried out at the same time.
Aviation and defence
While some enjoy ordering, capacity problems and price pressure in the production chain have been warned.
"It is absolutely true that the price pressure exists, especially now that the production volume is causing challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Managing Director of MB Aerospace, the major suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, Managing Director of the North West Aerospace Alliance, about 240 aircraft manufacturers representing the North West Aerospace Alliance are required to increase capacity.
"Do strategies and investment plans meet these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in new production facilities and machines that are needed to implement these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in the construction of aircraft are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, producing gas turbine wings, the company has a "difficult time" behind it when several new building plans started to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
We moved from a very small production to a state where production capacity was exceeded at the close of the eye.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several players in the sector believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed more if Great Britain is to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
The Chairman of the Ford Aerospace company and engineer Geoff Ford from Tyneside, fine engineering, say that the order should increase the confidence and desire of producers and increase production capacity, as work must be done.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
A few major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The company Senior, which is a member of the FTSE 250 index, purchased parts of the aeroplane in Malaysia with GBP 75 million from UPECA.
MB Aerospace purchased companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy new business start-up companies, but in reality, the design limitations and the number of engineers are slowing down most of the production," says Gallagher MB from Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned their price pressure from large aircraft manufacturers and engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain are being exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, Head of the GKN Aircraft Manufacturing Unit, also representing the British aircraft industry, is of the opinion that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"A more important volume is the introduction of new technologies and advanced processes," says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from mistakes and are now more cautious so that building volumes do not increase too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it faced great difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of the Rolls Royce aircraft production unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18 000 required for the manufacture of the engine.
"You will certainly be pitty, but we believe that we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with the journalists when they are preparing to increase their activity," Wood says.
According to James McNerney, Chief Executive Officer of Boeing, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, the managing director of the Airbus passenger jet production unit, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase production of the A350 model to 10 aircraft by the month of 2018.
"Perhaps one of the journalists will not succeed, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and to support the journalists and find options, but we have to wait for big problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the main supplier's responsibility.
So this is mine and Airbus's job."
Hong Kong demonstration groups will start open elections in the Beijing ban on "an era of national independence"
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democratic activists spread to the streets of Hong Kong after China's rejection of their open elections.
Hong Kong’s democratic groups stress that demonstrations can start and swear to ensure that the city begins a “period of insanity” in order to resist the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protesters, in the face of the coming rain, defied Hong Kong's bright horizon as they walked through the Democratic Occupy Central group, held a demonstration in front of the law enforcement council on Sunday night, where protesters called on people to participate in a broad-based sit-down to paralyze the city's financial district.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny voters the right to publicly propose candidates in the 2017 municipal election, thus defying the months of mental statements that will further increase the division of the city.
The protesters will be taking part in the Occupy Central demonstration in front of Hong Kong's central government buildings.
"We want fair and decent elections," says 24-year-old website maintainer Dion Tse, who participated in the Sunday demonstration with her 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the Hong Kong people's determination.
China's Supreme Legislative Body approved plans for electoral changes, allowing Hong Kong's first direct elections to take place in only two of the three candidates.
However, it requires the approval of the 1200-spirit nomination committee and, in the opinion of the opposition politicians, this effectively prevents the different political views expressed on the electoral flags.
Protesters will participate in the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was held in front of the Hong Kong government building in Tamar Park.
According to police estimates, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in mental expression.
A large number of police officers followed when some 100 protesters led by the school student group gathered late on Sunday for Grand Hyatt, where the Communist Party member Li Fein was to stay overnight after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, the Schoolerism and the Federation of Students.
Or not to comply with the exact date on which the road was closed, but urged the participants to monitor closely the development of the situation in the "following couple of weeks", adding that the city is officially moving into the "period of non-nationalisation".
Benny Or answers the press's questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in Sunday's demonstration, in front of the billboard representing the two disobedient characters standing in China.
That man will take over the center with you!
Joshua Wong, representing a 17-year-old group, said earlier that preparations for high school demonstrations are under way and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their opinion by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei of the Congress Committee told the journalists that the defence of the universal right to vote "international requirements" is a "loss of time" and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who seek "to confuse society and mislead it".
"Unpractical proposals such as the nomination of a public candidate have wasted a great deal of time," Li says, demanding that the election method be created in such a way that it fits the real situation of each society and the legislative framework.
Legislation on universal suffrage can only be adopted if a large majority, i.e. two thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, supports it, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
He warned that Hong Kong might have to enter into a lengthy political debate if the reform proposal was rejected as a right of veto.
"It would damage business and the development of the city," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal inquiry organised by the Occupy Central in June to oppose the demands of China, and the demands of the candidate require the approval of the committee.
Even 172 000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the march organised on 17 August against Beijing and Occupy Central attracted some 88 000 participants.
Three injured lightning attacks on the New York Beach
In a lightning strike on a New York swimming beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on the Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night, when heavy storms passed across the area.
Injured men are hospitalized.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the heavy thunderstorms wiped over the city.
The storms, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend and U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the East River Island.
Ten commercial flights to city airports were delayed due to bad weather.
I don't like the new idea.
This is the latest guide for network users for employees and superiors, and it is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
Entrepreneur Seth Godin says that a good idea is to recognize such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
Unless this is the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – that is, boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so limited that they are not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think he had anything new to offer.
Now, as head of the university, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message widely.
Advertiser Bob Hoffman believes TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news online does not mean that the Internet would be good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad alternative for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson points out that the motivation of the workers is one word: together.
In a study, participants were told that they were crucial to working together, even though they were actually working alone in an empty room, which worked longer and solved more problems than those who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeat pattern or relationship between two units, the performance expert Dave Paradi will advise you to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use the Graphier.com program, where you can choose 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart hospital excavating surgery prohibited due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily separated from his office, and the UK national health system NHS stopped directing patients to surgery in that private hospital after the problems with the hospital occurred.
Two people went to the hospital in Torbay after receiving first aid at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay hospital in Devon has said it was connected to 19 patients on 26 July and called them "urgent clinical trial".
The Mount Stuart Hospital regretted the matter and said that the matter had been investigated after the doctor was dismissed.
It came to the attention of the hospital in Torbay, when two patients who were treated at Mount Stuart sought first aid because of eye problems.
According to Torbay’s hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day required a repair operation.
The Torbay Hospital and the Southern Devon and Torbay Hospital have not controlled patients after the onset of the problems with Mount Stuart.
David Sinclair, the interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation leading the Torbay hospital, said that "we have identified the problem at its early stage and we were able to contact all the patients involved quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we conduct quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its authorisation matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, head of patient safety in the patient district of South Devon and Torbay, "patient safety is always at the top of the list, so it is important that these excavating operations are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, managing the Mount Stuart hospital, asked "seriously for the forgiveness of all patients with complications".
It was announced that "the moment we found out about the possible problem, we and later the Torbay hospital called all the patients concerned."
This specialist doctor has had a medical license from Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 excavating surgery in different parts of the organization. According to the statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he performed have been excellent and the complexity rate has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended temporarily until the case has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The evil anonymous communication site first published famous leaked naked photos
What exactly is "4chan" and why was it the hacker's first option when he published stolen images?
"4chan" was founded in 2003 and has been the subject of a communication website that is being called up as much as we would like.
The site has been divided into several parts, i.e. notification boards where anonymous users can discuss all possible video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web platforms, users do not create an equal, continuously used profile and their publications are not kept.
The most popular reporting tables may lose comments in less than a minute when the newer publications eliminate them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchic and surprisingly creative atmosphere for "4chan".
Some of the most well-known meetings (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats") have been created by community members who work anonymously, but the absence of the website rules has also led to a great deal of questionable or criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification table on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and for regular NSFW content (Note Safe For Work).
This may include harsh porn, but also brutal and shocking images. The name-free hacker published the stolen photos of celebrities specifically on this reporting table during the weekend.
CytRx in the US invests in cancer medicine research and development
CytRx's goal is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
The company that produces biological drugs in Los Angeles, which was recently the target of the auction of shares, specializes in research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising drug is aldoxorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, Kapos sarcoma and renewable glioblastomas or brain tumours associated with AIDS.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly into the tumor and not into other bodies, says the CEO of CytRx, Steven Kriegsma, about aldoxorubicin cancer medicine.
My aldoxorubicin contains so-called compound technology that acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly in the blood to a protein that also accumulates in the tumours, so that the medicine passes directly to the cancer cells.
I've joined forces to give up the medicine only in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows more and more cancer medicines to be administered to patients at multiple doses.
"It's like a missile that goes straight into the tumor and not into the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus raised $86 million for business maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a pivotal 3-stage clinical study of soft tissue sarcoma alternative therapy.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body's soft tissues, such as blood vessels, muscles and fatty tissue.
Alternative therapy is used in cancer therapy when the initial treatment does not result.
If clinical research is successful, CytRx plans to apply for a drug authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicine could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx in the previous clinical study in December showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was "we have seen clinical data on how much it differs from the drug itself," says Andrew Fein, analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co..
The publication of the results confirmed many opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timetable of the current clinical trial, as it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
It's fine to compare the drug development to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money will be invested to find its one golden vein, and the investment will continue for so long that it will be found," he says.
Money is spent on research and development for so long that the drug is commercially viable.
Several shareholders have called for the CytRx company to be brought to justice because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the submissions, the company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group investment company, which, according to the allegations, hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and the other biotechnology company, Forbes, Seeing Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the claims, the articles did not find out that the companies paid the authors fees.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had removed the articles "that were against practical".
Several articles about the company were also deleted from other websites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to complaints.
"I don't have time and energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to work in centres of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a wilderness from the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
The views of analysts
The price of CytRx's shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then decreased to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising the shares came to the public.
According to the analyst, the actions and negative publicity have decreased the price of the shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to bypass this as long as the idea is in place."
In the name of the law, the cameraman was killed in the middle of the descriptions.
On Tuesday night, when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident, the photographer of the series, also presented in the name of the Finnish Law, died based on actual events.
The cameraman photographed the shooting of a suspect in the armed robbery of a local police patrol and a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He quickly died of injuries.
According to the TMZ website, the police reported that, in addition to a cameraman, a person suspected of armed robbery was killed during the shooting incident.
The first series of Real TV programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of the external factor arises from the crucial role played by Ulvila in the treatment of court cases that began today.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahde, in 2006.
Vaasa's court now deals with the case for the second time, since the Supreme Court restored it to the district court with new evidence.
The court's purpose is to give a judgment for another half of this year.
Vaasa's court freed Auer in 2011.
In that case, the court considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening speech, the Public Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala spoke about the prosecutor’s view of the night of the murder and the factors that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether the external factor that has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in the way and in time has come into the house.
It's about Anneli Auer's story on credibility," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the adultery began with a family dispute during which Auer had declared that he was leaving home and seeking divorce.
At some point they moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop this departure.
One of them took the kitchen knife," Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, a number of facts prove that there was no external factor in the case.
For example, the emergency call caller does not belong to an external factor.
The oldest child - daughter of the Auer told me during the interrogation that when a man left the fireplace door, he saw the perpetrator.
The 2011 liberating judgment in Vaasa's court was partly based on the daughter's report.
According to the prosecutor, the finding of a daughter cannot be true
"Tytar didn't see an outsider in the parents' bedroom, even though he went there twice looking," Kulmala said.
The new prosecutor's witness is connected to the possibility of an outside agent.
Jukka S. Lahde's sister has told me about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing she told me in the hospital was that she only saw the body of Lahti when she was on the death scene in the fireplace.
Auer's defence plans to introduce legal investigation lines whose proportion, according to the defence, the police have not been sufficiently resolved.
When the court of Vaasa released three years ago from Auer’s charge, the court held that the foreign man’s DNA found was a reference to an outsider.
The evidence later proved to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Police Laboratory
That's when a 700-person DNA sample was taken on a mass day.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspected and alternative investigation lines were excluded," said defense lawyer Juha Manner.
One of the new witnesses in the defense tells of a possible outsider.
The Ulvilian woman told the police about a bourgeois man who, according to the woman's report, had confessed to the act.
The police interviewed him in the summer.
The prosecutor made the decision that the deputy has nothing to do with the crime of life.
The prosecutor made a request for an investigation, because the prosecutor suspects that she was lying in her report.
One of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who was employed at the central hospital of the Satakunta on the night of the death.
Hundred-and-a-century district court sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the judgment of the District Court, the possibility of an outsider was contested, inter alia, by the reports of the children of Auer, by the missing voices referring to the outsider as well as by the time required by the events.
The verdict came in 2-1.
The judge who remained with the minority wrote that the evidence contrary to the criminal case must be interpreted as being for the benefit of the accused.
That is why the daughter’s account must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions of the report, this had found an external factor leaving the fireplace.
The two oldest children of the Sun have been called to hear the court.
The daughter was first personally heard last year in the Catholic District Court.
When he was heard in court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
The second oldest child in the Sun named her mother the killer in a video call in 2011.
The boy told me he heard about the events of the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told us that Auer planned to kill him for six months.
The son has no duty to express his opinion in court.
The trial is continuing today with Anneli Auer's hearing.
If necessary, the sun will continue to be heard tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years of imprisonment for child sexual and violent offences.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him many one enemy.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is eager to discuss whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock Activist Group Pussy Riot called on Australia during the weekend to ban Putin's participation in the summit, with more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most influential countries.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20," Maria Alyochina said to the public at Sydney's full-packed opera house at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the verge of a "complete war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new Russia". So is it necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said "that he weighs the decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, Head of the G20 Unit at the Lowy Institute, Australians cannot decide which members to attend, even though the meeting will be held in the country.
"Australia can decide who to let go, but it's an international meeting," he says.
Just as New York's host of UN meetings or Washington's host of International Monetary Fund meetings, "the host's mission is not to ban anyone called to come," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said "to weigh the decision" after Russia's repugnant actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
As Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on this alone.
"However, there is an important thing that I come to weigh a lot, and I believe that the other countries will also do so in the coming weeks," he says.
People attend the anti-war meeting in Mariupol, Eastern Ukraine.
The event takes two days, involving a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest developing economies, with a total of about two thirds of the world's population, accounting for 85% of world GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a number of countries not specifically called G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task of balancing between different interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best way of dealing with this issue is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Minister should say that we are going to take advantage of this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will call on President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, he has a duty to explain his actions," Callaghan says.
There is a clear increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
The Russian rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk airport for the attack on Ukrainian military bases in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and according to Callaghan, this may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that "I need to change my attitude towards Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
The opposition leader Bill Shorten is "very cautious" about Putin's arrival in Australia, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with the other countries and the G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
Following the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines disaster, and in the absence of proper cooperation in terms of pity, responsibility and air crash, I think that most Australians are very cautious about welcoming Putin to Australia.
Germany's business is critical of "self-concerned" Berlin
Some of Germany's top company leaders warn that Germany has become 'too confident' and 'self-concerned', as government policy threatens the country's difficult competitiveness.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of the government happens at the same time as Europe's largest economy shows signs of slowdown, which gives rise to concerns about its ability to rotate economic growth in a tight euro area.
The criticism of business managers is the result of the strong opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wages and the calculation of the retirement age of certain long-time workers for 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a feeling of self-reliance," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer, BASF.
EU economy
He believes this: "In general, there is a feeling that we are working well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and that we are not a favourable environment for companies, but instead we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, Managing Director of the German Industrial Organisation (BDI) "The situation in Germany is now good.
Over the next ten years, however, each developed economy will have to change. ...[Germany] The reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even the decline in consumption has been increasing again.
However, lower GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of Germany's export earnings to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2 per cent over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation more difficult, and it may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government 'to move from public consumption back to public investment', for example by concentrating future consumption on infrastructure rather than pensions.
In Kerber's opinion, the Merkel government is destroying the fruits of its social democrat predecessor Gerhard Schröder's policies at the beginning of the 21st century.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Foundation for Family Business, Family Business Foundation, "The situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies and not so much to government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The neighbouring country, the French example, has shown that using money for social assistance and limiting the freedom of management are the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment bank described the situation more directly, saying that recent government decisions are "disaster".
Germany threatens to lose everything it has done so much work, just to please voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition have failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused the industry to suffer from a loss of competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher's handcuff at the music festivals, once security guards are denied access to the fan
The actress Ashton Kutcher participated in Stagecoach's music festivals in India, California, where he was told that he had been in a fight with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have fought with a security officer at the Cantrian Music Festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him on the backstage at Stagecoach Music Festival in California, after which the situation came to a close, the TMZ site tells us.
Kutcher was in a VIP room when a young woman approached her to greet and handcuff her.
When the man-half-series star went to greet the fan, the overwhelming security officer got in the middle and caused a bludgeon.
An actor and a security guard drifted into a handcuff, and Kutcher’s friends had to intervene to arrest Kutcher,” TMZ says.
After his ex-wife, Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is like Kutcher's star of the former 70's.
Soon after Angus T. Jones had virtually been removed from the hit series of the standard show card, he released a video in which he called the series "smooth" and urges fans not to look at it.
The actress Ashton Kutcher will take part in Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake," calls a series "skinny" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic bacterium killed the vacationer
Six people have been infected by a bacteria from the Caribbean, which is a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in spreading in more than 20 degrees breakwaters.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right," says Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGUS) to the local newspaper.
The bacteria are found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGUS, the sick had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg will have to be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoopia with a small wound on his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after finding on his way home that his leg has turned blue.
The doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger," the sick wife Sonja Bruehl told Ostsee Zeitung.
Serious illness and the damage caused to the patient and his family could have been avoided if the information had been better available.
LAGUS told the dpa news agency that doctors have been advised to follow the infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official news release was given.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"[Monday] test results show that V. vulnificus has been significantly reduced," says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of a cholera-induced bacterium, is particularly dangerous if a person has a pre-existing chronic liver disease and a decreased immune response, such as in HIV or diabetes patients and in elderly people.
Men's risk of disease is higher than women, as oestrogen has been found to be protective of pathogens.
If the bacteria get sick, it will cause blood poisoning and sepsis.
The probability of death of the bacterium in the event of a wound is approximately 25%.
V. vulnificus can also become ill by eating marine mammals, although according to Dr. Will, these cases are not infectious.
Marine food pollution is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, the V. vulnificus bacterium caused poisoning the previous time in 2010, when two people died.
Export Kekkonen: Rift removed due to cancer suspicion
Revealing the 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen is playing and training hard, but she has also had to fear for her health.
It is incredible that the radiating Vieno Kekkonen already fills 80 years.
In fact, he is amazed how many years of age can suddenly be so much.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
80 years sounds like a lot of things, but Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held by the League of Music and Pensioners in Kartula, where he lived for his child.
We were on Kekkola stage, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was totally indignant at the party, and the birthday hero tells us about the opportunity for the three-seater stage to be filled with congratulations.
A few days later, the Muhoks met to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life is remembered by Vieno Kekkonen as a young man.
And now we're both age-old!
Exporto Kekkonen's laughing.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects that Vieno Kekkose has not seen in public.
One thing he has never told the public before: in 2006 he was removed from the other breast.
There was an unclear discovery in my chest at a point where it was decided to completely remove it.
After all, it wasn't cancer, of course, of which I was happy.
In the same operation, a new breast was made, so it was a rather large measure.
Exporto Kekkonen has not thought that she had lost her own breasts in a way that was useless, because knowledge of the unclear finding would have been a heavy burden and that could not be left untreated.
I was only so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells and notes that for younger ones the loss of one's own breast is certainly more difficult.
Read Vieno Kekkonen's extensive personal interview in full on the day of Evening-Sano.
Get to know the jungle here!
The farmer shall be made guilty in the state of the sea;
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection with Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voice of experts has been lost to political opinions.
During the summer, the Helsinki Declarations and Yle in particular shared agricultural responsibility for nutrient emissions in the Baltic Sea.
At the same time, rapid action has been needed to control emissions.
The average income of the farmer appears to be a few environmental researchers and, with their help, to be superior to the food expert.
The farmer knows that nutrient desulphurisation cannot come from farming if the same amount of nutrients have been planted in the field as the crop will be harvested.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful monitoring and reporting of nutrient balance.
The authorities will monitor compliance.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been washed into the watercourses after fertilisation restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers have the will and readiness to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero levels is impossible.
"If we want to have some agricultural production that is roughly equivalent to consumption, we only have to accept that it is," says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of the MTT Environmental Survey (MT 29.8.).
Last summer, the Gulf of Finland was the subject of large-scale blue-winging.
The scientists were quite unanimous that the rest gained its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus risks.
Phosphorus stored at sea is partly depreciated from the agriculture of the past decades of coastal states, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The wastewater treatment of the growing cities of the Baltic Sea beaches was in the late 1900s.
The problem also concerned large-scale waste water and was not seen as a problem as with the pollution of own shores.
Pollution of the shores was prevented by building a waste water pipe in the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water in that area has improved over the years.
Once upon a time, the nutrients that have ended up in the sea do not leave Finland, even though the agriculture would be completely stopped from Finland.
However, every summer a blue debate and accusations are always about agriculture today.
The public debate marks the fault of the farmer in the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
The Greens, under the leadership of Environment Minister Ville Niinistö, are driving major changes to agri-environmental standards.
The Ponnahdusplattna Niinistö has used the summer rest debate.
It has, to a large extent, accused the producer's representative organisation of old-age employment in MTK and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some limit on political rhetoric.
Most of the specific projects in the field of water protection are based on cooperation between SMEs, farmers and environmental management.
Such an attacking style serves more fishing for city-green voices than water protection.
I think that's the point.
With hard words, the greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the role of the MTK is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a substitute for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is the cuts from other agricultural funds.
The repeal of the mining tax will not go through: Palmer
The last attempt by the Abbott government to throw a mining tax into the trash bin seems to have been doomed, because Clive Palmer has declared that his Senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party is also afraid that the Government has included in the new initiative a rule that could limit employers' increases to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday in order to speed up the process of annulment in the power of public confusion and in the face of clear arson by the Labour Party.
It put aside the original repeal initiative, which had previously been substantially amended by the Senate, and replaced it with the new bill, which it described as related, above all, to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Initially, it was an initiative to repeal the "unlucky" mining tax and other decisions, such as the low-income pension payment ($3.6 billion savings), the income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
The Leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP) did not accept the government's transfer.
"A poorly planned mining tax cancellation fund will not be accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension, a salary support bonus and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs support from independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Bowe, the shadow finance minister, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory guarantee amount for pension contributions, giving the finance minister all the power to decide.
"This is unheard of," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further increases, which would lead to an increase of 12% in the guarantee of employee pension contributions to 2034.
"It is not in any way acceptable, and the Labour Party will, of course, oppose all means," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5 per cent, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop any future additions.
A man's body was found on Brighton's beach.
Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the afternoon two tides, closing the area near the beginning of Volk's Electric Railway.
The police and the coroner are working to find out where the body was on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers go through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons have contact with the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
The Mexican police say that by an explosion at the border that happened accidentally, one death victim was killed.
According to the Piedras Negras police, the accidental explosion at the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas serves as the operational director of the local police force at the Texas border.
She told the Associated Press news agency that in the Sunday explosion, a dead woman suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
Lopez Arenas says that the explosion occurred in the morning at the nighttimes of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion has resulted in the accumulation of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border guards.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Man's client plays in the Showboat casino, which is to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos are closing their doors in this month's Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this nine-light, brightly known metropolis can no longer count on gaming revenues.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed at the closure of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office reported.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, the expected closure will be the city's most recent disaster after the story of the Atlantic Club Center ended only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25 per cent of the city's casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were announced as a safe choice for the poor Atlantic City, the AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors as New York, Delawaren and Pennsylvania casinos block much of the Atlantic City once over.
Even in opposition to gambling in the past, Massachusetts looks at its own part of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: New schedule for Areva difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the supplier Areva that Olkiluodo's three-phase reactor will not be commercially available until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction work is already well ready and the number of work to be done is well known.
The TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
Mr Silvennoinen noted in the newsletter that the TVO welcomed all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today submitted Olkiluoto 3’s updated schedule, according to which the construction of the three reactors will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to Areva, the latest delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor automation systems that were obtained in April.
This was the case with the four-year negotiations with the TVO.
As early as 2009, it had to be completed, but the schedule has been postponed one after the other.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
It is a matter of dispute in arbitration, where Areva has claimed a total of EUR 2.7 billion from the TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's requirements to be unfounded and requires approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water operators is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm within the 24th International Water Week and called on energy and water industry players to cooperate to meet the biggest challenges facing our time, to ensure that sufficient water and energy production are growing.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed to pump, store, transport and clean up water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it affects the other immediately.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
At the opening of the water week, Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organised by the Water Week, said that 'the challenges are enormous'.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water operators is urgently needed to find solutions that will enable all the world's peoples to flourish.
This year's Water Week Award recipient, Professor John Briscoe, described water as a basis for growth that needs both society as a whole and other sectors.
They have to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "there is no permanent solution to the water crisis anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form part of the circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI of Sweden at the ceremony held in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research information and provides decision-makers with information so that they can make sensible decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flight of dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Cost of body flight
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds before, and I'm sure this wasn't the last of it.
Every year, more than 1,000 Mediterranean immigrants die illegally trying to cross the US border.
The first city is ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that, after reaching the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either the asylum, the pushboard up, or the entertainment place while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of migrants there is an disproportionate number of people born abroad and residing temporarily, and they are constantly working on death and repatriation.
An estimated 20 percent of dead bodies in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of professional string of words human remains) are flown to the country from Miami International Airport.
According to Pierson, the managing director of the industry, since 1964, about 80 % of this traffic has gone abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in Central and South America as well as to several European countries.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, homecoming has its cost.
Miami is the main airport for flights to Latin America from American Airlines, and the figures in the table describe the airline's human remains flown back to its home country in 2013.
Returning bodies to the country is not cheap: prices can vary from five to 100 thousand dollars.
Religious, cultural and public health requirements for the flight and supply of human residues also vary.
Migrant communities that are popular with immigrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help in costs, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young who do not have insurance.
A number of credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes have been created from communities founded by the Italian, Jewish and Greek communities in New York — the first groups of immigrants in the United States.
New generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos and Bangladeshi migrants are now operating in many of their favourite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few foreign migrants plan to make their last resters from a migrant city.
For example, in Dubai, without a will, for foreigners who are dead, Sharia law is respected, even though the laws on the inheritance of the dead country are different.
The entire estate of the deceased shall be frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
A network of Aer Lingus, a central Dublin airline, to carry human resources (
2013) The scope reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service, but restarted it in 2004 after having received a negative return from the migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through the migrants’ favourite city or when he lives there.
On the contrary – a temporary or permanent migration to a migrant city is an open declaration of the migrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
However, death in a migrant city abroad means making the most powerful and irrevocable decisions for the migrant – whether it is a local or a global community, a world universe or a country, a short-term or an eternal one.
The Centre and the Left are making the interim issue of inequality
The opposition parties in the centre and the left will make the government an interim issue on the income of low income and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate a debate on people's livelihood problems, which are exacerbating poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
Growing inequality also appears between the different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in their press release.
The government's next year's budget includes cuts and tax increases for the parties' low income, such as students, the unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary employment, while food, medicines and housing, among other things, continue to increase.
Almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The problems of living at work have also worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Central and Left Alliance will deal with the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party of basic Finns has already announced that they have left an interim question on police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary part-session will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
New York City's West Indian Day parade is about to start
The Caribbean culture is once again in the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day paradise is one of the largest outdoor events of the year, where politicians also see each other and come to see each other.
The annual parade will be held in Brooklyn on Monday.
It evokes the celebrations of carnivals before the traditional fasting season, and some of them are dancers who carry complex, often smooth, costumes.
The president of the Brooklyn area, Eric Adams, is this year's festival champion, but there are also many other well-known faces to expect.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and nominated politicians to greet the audience a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the celebrations, violence has also occurred in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Do you even want to ask rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
That question should not be answered.
This picture of the language, or question, which is not expected to be answered, but which suggests a certain response, tastes both high - aired speeches and a more daily exchange of words.
The first words of Ciceron's famous Catilina prosecution are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, will you take advantage of our patience?"
The same applies to the questions I put to my wife: "Why shouldn't I warm the children with chicken five days old?"
Why are you so tense?
The distinction is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The strength of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is moved to accept the question.
The mysterious rhetorical question suggests that no one could fully agree with it.
David Williams, author of the 19th-century editorial guide, described the rhetorical question as "an indicated word that is admirably designed to produce a strong feeling of the truth about something, while at the same time the challenge they pose is impossible to disagree with".
Convulsion skills
The rhetorical questions can be put afterwards if we want to achieve more ambitious objectives.
Several consecutive rhetorical questions, designed to express grief or anger, are called epiplexies.
For example, Job uses them when he appeals to the Almighty: "What good is it for you to oppress me?
Do you have the same eyes as we do?
Do you see the same way that man sees?
The chains of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
There is also a hypoforma, which is what we are talking about when we ask the question and answer it ourselves immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers this excellent example: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?
Parru!
True mooses!
Who sacrificed his life for his brother?
Add examples from my wife: "What is the only food, what children have eaten, and where have they been able to get sick?"
This chicken.
Who's the idiot who fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetorical question usually does not aim to bend, even though rhetoric means bending skills.
If you are trying to talk to someone around you instead of trying to preach to those who have already been translated, or if you are indulging in someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful when trying to reconcile opinions than when trying to get one to accept one’s own opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim "Isn't it nice when there's so much sunshine out there?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure that he says what better links the speaker and the public together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is certain that there is no different opinion.
Assuming that unanimity has been achieved instead of seeking unanimity, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of the argument.
On the headlines of the papers, the rhetorical question is too often clearly the strongest argument possible in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, the risk is that the question may lead to an answer which differs from the one suggested.
"Are you thinking the same way we do?" belonged to the UK Conservative Party's risky campaign campaign in the general elections in 2005.
The party lost.
For some such cases has become a hobby, and questions such as QTWAIN (the British journalist John Rentoul's concept of the famous Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions whose answer is no) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine held a competition to find the best examples.
The competition clearly won the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", which was sung by the pop star Gary Glitter before he was revealed as a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researchers: The time of the federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise on the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian Channel that peace in eastern Ukraine requires debate on the state of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the east.
According to Saaren, Ukraine's transition to a federal state is, in a certain way, a priority for Russia.
Ukraine certainly has a reason to doubt that Russia would thereby seek to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If a federal solution is not achieved, another option could be a sort of frozen conflict from the Russian point of view, where Russia would practically control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari evaluates.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons as well as soldiers east.
Russia has denied the arguments, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have told them that they have fought for "voluntary Russian soldiers on leave".
Upsteller: The most influential task planned for the Katainen
The brick reminds me that the job picture is new and still being shaped.
He felt that Katainen would in some way coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on issues related to competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new programme for the period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is the way the Commission is at the heart of its power, Tiilikainen says.
The brick is of the opinion that the background, economic skills and the role of Kataise during the economic crisis give him a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be without portfolio, i.e. Katainen would not have his own Directorate-General under his authority.
On the other hand, Kata would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, in which he could have co-ordinated portfolios in addition to the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
In practice, team management could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: in Ukraine up to 15 000 Russian soldiers
According to the Mothers of the Russian Soldiers organisation, in the past two months, as many as 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine, and there are currently over 7 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organisation, the hospital in Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is wounded during the war in Ukraine.
The mothers of the soldiers gather their knowledge from the soldiers themselves.
NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte on alcohol use: "After a little drink, it's going to be a case."
Big brother Jussi and Andte drove on Monday night to think about the life of the BB house.
Jussi, on the side of the basement, rode a fitness bike with the Andes of the Cartano population on Monday night.
Two people wondered how they felt about the viewers of the programme.
That's not how it works until you've seen it, Andte said.
The train believes that most of the time in the BB house is waiting and consuming.
The possible celebrations or tasks are only a fraction of the BB house's life.
More than that, we take it, we wonder it, we talk it out, we live it out.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of the map spent the evening in the damp, and the alcohol was on top of the Ande’s voice.
Jussi asked Andtel if the parties had made a man’s life more meaningful in his house now that he had gotten into a small hipra to talk to these other residents.
A little drink, and then the story comes, Andte admits.

The division of profits among companies pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Do the directors of Australian stock exchange companies today only try to please a large crowd by giving to the shareholders their wishes for a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is it the decision-making power to move from the governments of companies to the shareholders that are served by the government?
The main division of profits was shown last week at the end of the 2014 reporting period.
The prices of company shares that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing bad about it.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is falling faster than the analysts have predicted, and many people are asking whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether there is sufficient focus on the near future and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is obtained from, for example, cheap stock markets.
From the company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while capital is not.
While not taking into account the resources acquired from the loan market, it is clear that the most important financing for the transparency of shareholders is the use of less money to invest.
The net result of the wave of this buy-in programme (and the withdrawal of profit investment plans) is a reduction in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of capital decline" during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and fewer capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the buy-back programmes was $3.7 billion and the expected value of the unrealised capital procurement programmes was $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to consider the consumption of capital as part of a curse on a title of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
The Governor of the Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, felt that it was sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "combat spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens does not worry about the future prospects of individual companies, but has an overall impact on the economy, as the slow consumption of capital generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "the own estimates of capital consumption by reporting companies have been calculated on average by 4% over the previous two years.
The estimates of free cash flow have risen on average by 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This rapid approach has a good impact from the perspective of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of proof of companies' compliance.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO said that the price of the stock is not important for a short period of time, I would be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
Managing directors follow very closely the prices of shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the managers depends on it.
Managing directors want to say that some decisions (whether business, investment in an organisation or profit sharing) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, managers often complain that there is a very short-sighted approach to the investment market.
That is why it seems that the tree of the current Conservativeism is yielding to the short-term objectives.
In the opinion of those who estimate the low-cost share market and benefit from capital saving, there is no such concern, but it was too clear during the reporting period that the weight was in the process of reducing the consumption of future capital and that the most sparing companies were called upon to do so.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one position in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also did the same – part of the obligation and part of the fear of the shareholders’ reaction.
Why, then, do investors pressure companies to share profits?
Credit Suisse’s strategicist Hasan Tevfik clearly believes that shareholders want more revenue, because the profits of other more traditional fixed-income investment products have decreased as the central banks have surprisingly reduced interest rates worldwide in order to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital market to seek profits and, in turn, pressure companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profits are uncertain.
Investors prefer to want money right away as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution was affected by a large number of company cost cuts and not by growth in net sales.
The cases of public naked images appear to be in the data box or in the e-mail account.
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources indicate that an unknown hacker leaked videos on the Internet wonder at the security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicists in a chat room and said that he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images have been faked while others have said that it was a long time ago deleted images.
There are a lot of pictures and it has been said to be among them Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And were the pictures and videos authentic and where they were loaded from?
The most recent source of images – a shameless and thorough attack on the iCloud service in Apple – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security devices that work inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company's own systems on a regular basis.
"The large-scale hacking of Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher argue that the claim should be true," notes Rik Ferguson, Vice President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hackers associated with the public (and hackers of lesser-known people every day) is the e-mail address and password leak, either by guessing or by fishing, i.e. by tricking a person to log in to a real-life site and then using this information against them.
Apple will continue to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to the cloud server.
The user's account can be logged into the iCloud service by giving this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the owner of the account has introduced a two-stage authentication ("2FA") i.e. additional protection against intrusion, which will send the code to the owner's mobile phone before it can be registered.
However, relatively few people use the 2FA feature, either because it is unknown or because it is considered difficult.
Apple will continue to investigate whether all the data originates from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely the user's accounts were penetrated.
The company has not delivered an opinion on the matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgotten Password" link in the Apple iCloud service by first collecting public email addresses from, for example, another hacked device address book.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in a number of services where passwords were captured through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the images are genuine, but does not tell us when they are taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking operation.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this required a creepy effort.
I feel compassion for all those who are being hacked," he wrote in tweets.
Independent IT expert Graham Cluley points out, however, that Winstead may have removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from the smartphone of today does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Today's smartphones regularly record images in the cloud service, as they often lack the capacity to take large amounts of images.
Apple’s standard iPhone regulation is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft’s Windows phones to store images for OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic photo and data storage services.
"People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that pictures are loaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deleted does not always mean deleted", he says.
Images and videos can be kept for years.
If someone accesses the user's e-mail address and password, he or she can reload all images and videos sent by e-mail.
Images of Apple's service can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot, which was alleged to present videos and images taken from Windows PC, which were not yet published.
Two-step identification protects against such hacking, as it requires all those who try to copy an existing account to another device to give the original user a code that is usually sent to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account is prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-stage identification to the account, but yet not known whether the persons in question used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images where they are claimed to be are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures in which the Grande is claimed to be are "fully faked".
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweet: "I think the naked images taken from me are WORRY, don't you understand?
Let me cut off the rumours right from the beginning.
Cluley's bringing out another option.
Since the hacking targets were public figures, their accounts may have been broken by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly handled their emails.
"I want to know if the actors' agents or any representative are involved," he thinks.
However, such persons do not use one publisher or agent.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped configure a security attack on the victim’s one or more systems and changed the secret system so that all information could be returned.
This was the case in the case of Christopher Chaney, a Floridan player with the Hollywood hacker, where the hacker spread images from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunisi's e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly entering the e-mail accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera, in the name of this stylist, for pictures of the star in low-wear, and then published the photos online.
Chaney later apologized for saying that his actions "are certainly one of the worst breaches of privacy that can be imagined".
Chaney was also said to be spying on two people online for over ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Cheney, the stars were broken and changed so that someone sent their information even after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "remembers the collection of the butterfly."
They just want to collect such information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of such account information and login information in services such as Dropbox.
The hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time.
or they got access to the information in someone's e-mail account, such as the address book, and then fished the information in other people's e-mail account.
I don't think this would be a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to have held 44 Fijian peacekeepers, who captured the crossing site on the hills of Golan last week and forced the United Nations forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and there is no information about their whereabouts.
Ministers participating in the UN Conference of Small Island Developing States, such as Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General, Ban ki-Moon, at the summit, and he has offered Australian assistance to help save the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN wherever it can by providing, among other things, the help of the intelligence service," he said to the AAP news service in Samoa on Monday.
We're very close to all the partners and friends in the intelligence network -- to make sure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimaram, and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, that Australia is using its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Filipino Peacekeeper Group in its army barracks was reported to have escaped from the same conflicting territory.
The United Nations has been monitoring the hills of Golan since the 1974 fire in Syria and Israel.
The scammers are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax cancellation initiative, warns Australian competition authority ACCC
The scammers use the carbon tax cancellation facility to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses not to trust the government's agencies to be too good to listen to, offering a rebate of thousands of dollars.
The scammers may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save in the purchase of goods after the cancellation of the carbon tax and offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
The scammers may sound very convincing because they have investigated the victim’s personal information that they use in trying to obtain bank information or in trying to get the victim to pay the fee.
They're discussing topical issues to trick the victim.
Non-carbon tax fraud is used by scammers to access money. Their stories are more advanced, and they take advantage of topical things to build a scam around them.
Also, the lost aircraft and the death of Robin Williams on the flight of Malaysia Airlines, MH370, have inspired frauds.
The ACCC is advised to contact the company using the contact information it has investigated instead of the contact information provided by the player if there is no doubt as to the identity of the representative player.
If you receive an unexpected phone call or email from someone who claims to represent the government agency or company, such as the energy company, and who claims that you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the carbon tax, please be alert.
If you believe you have been deceived and provided personal information or transferred money to the fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money distributed by the government – it probably is.
Economic Messages: Lipponen condemns the EU's sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the EU's sanctions on Russia in the interview on economic statements.
Russia's priority in politics is to drive for its own advantage.
The sanctions do not necessarily have any effect on this," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as the business manager of the EC Arctic Areas of the Economic and Social Union.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects with clear prospects for the Northern Dimension go to ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funds now hampers cooperation, which, according to Lipposen, can be difficult if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region continues to be as high as in the past.
He is currently explaining to the EK the Arctic policy of Finland and the opportunities for companies in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks at things far ahead, talks about tens of years," he says.
Rarely, norppa comes in low water or close to the place of residence, says nature teacher Vesa Heinonen from the lecture center of the North American Museum.
At Vaasa Suvilahde, we saw a elephant swimming near the beach on Sunday.
According to Heinosen, the elephant is likely to have come after Suvilahte.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, the tip of Heinone.
He says, for example, that the bridge of Sundom has a special view of the spring and autumn elephants, who arrive specifically after the fish.
However, Norway is not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
On the payland, we'll see the elephant on the side of the villas, and he'll go on.
Norway is living in the Mediterranean and the archipelago.
According to the court of South Australia, the murdered pizza owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizza owner Robert Vallelonga.
The trial found that the pizza owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively with both his partner and security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers charged with the murder of Vallelonga asked Adelai's lower court to release their client from bail because it was "clearly" self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been published, behind bars until the trial.
"According to the evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, the blizzard began, resulting in this 40-year-old drunk man... tearing a security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death caused one blow, which clearly points to self-defence or to the defense of another.
Twenty-five-year-old man is currently being charged with murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at approximately 2.25 p.m. on 4 May. He had severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries in the royal hospital of Adelai early the next day. Friends and pizzars were left to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the case, he had told the taxi driver "to make someone sleep for a few days".
But the video footage of the security camera is now proving something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his own share of hard and violent behaviour," he says.
Our client has both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutions objected to the release of the man, because only one of the three security officers on the spot on the night of the death had been missing in Vallelonga’s conduct.
According to them, other security officers did not think he was threatening because "he was short", and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that the taxi driver, also clearly seen in the case, would prove that Vallelonga was "strongly hit", and he had no opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
Enchanted dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on tradition - foreign news - Night Words
Bad weather was expected to delay in the world at the beginning of a largely deplorable hunt.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
There is a lot of opposition from the world over about the yacht that has become part of the Guardian, among other things.
Hundreds of dolphins are driven by hunters to the remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after they have been selected from among the most suitable individuals to transport to dolphinariums and themeds around the world.
Delfin meat also ends up in food.
According to local authorities, however, the initial hunting was expected to be delayed due to poor weather conditions.
Information on the practice was disseminated to the world in 2009 with the documentary film The Cove on this subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, yachts have criticized not only animal protectors but also diplomats.
According to opponents, dolphin meat has in any case a limited market due to its high mercury content.
It is tradition for those who defend hunting, including the Japanese Government.
Defenders have also reminded us that dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin hunt was already opposed during the weekend in several countries with demonstrations.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, Japan’s reputation in the world was damaged.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday before the Japanese Embassy.
Part of NATO's member countries are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the military alliance shares views on whether NATO should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries in response to the crisis in Ukraine, says the newspaper Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukrain has given a new perspective on Russian policy, and it threatens to undermine European security," said Michael Clarke Financial Times, Director of the London Royal United Services Institute.
The NATO member states are due to publish their new contingency plans at the beginning of the week.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the 1990 TAE Convention on conventional weapons.
In it, NATO and the Warsaw Alliance agree on how to place armed forces in the Atlantic and Ural mountain regions.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO is considering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato's resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need them," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the British Parliament's Security Committee.
Matt Guthiller, the youngest flying around the world
When the other teens learned how to drive a car, Matt Guthiller learned how to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmill just flew around the world – and still alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A youth living in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On their way, Guthmiller was treated as a rock star thanks to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"To be too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Mr Guthmiller did not have much to say to the commentators.
Of course, I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my prophecy I will also inspire other people to go out into the world and do great things.
Guthiller's flight enthusiasm started early, and first he asked his parents to go to the airport cafes.
Later on, he insisted on going to flight hours.
My parents let me go for a short 20 - dollar 20 - a 20 - minute tour, but I think they thought at that time that my enthusiasm would stop.
Didn't stop.
Soon after that, Guthiller concluded an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share with my father the car with the whole high school instead of getting my own car.
At the exchange shop, I could fly planes.
By 17 years of age, Guthmiller had received a flight permit and two years later he joined the single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT high school took care of the aircraft itself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the overheads also meant that he himself needed additional tanking —
Practically lots of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says that he ate a few invents completely during a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries were not able to regulate how they could have helped him navigate the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just slightly above the plane and which were above 45 000 feet and tore the aircraft to pieces.
Guthiller's plane had no pressure or oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel could not have been higher.
On the day following the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his trip the most difficult part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he felt that the recovery phase would be technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
However, in spite of the risks and even the high profile, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he set up his own business at the age of 12.
The targets of Guthmiller are fixed in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but now let's see how it happens.
At any rate, Guthminler's going to be high.
Aim for heaven and you can achieve something great.
Finding a real franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited to join fans on his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori sales across Canada after the Canadian W-TV began to show The Cupcake Girls in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was inappropriate.
"My Franchise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are going outside the store to get ready to buy a cupcake and he won't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the franchise partners' selection process to focus on the company's cultural leadership rather than on breadmaking.
"Anyone can shine at the interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about a hundred interviews for each 11 franchise movement.
We start with six weeks of training, but employees work in a completely different way in the workplace themselves, so the whole process is rather difficult, which is why we focus on training, above all, on the suitability for business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest leader is able to modify and grow the organisation, while a poorly-suited leader can cause costly damage to the company.
"Before I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like going on a date, but that's not true at all, during the dating you can do a lot to get to know one another before getting married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a holding agreement is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is built.
Becoming a partner with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and an important confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship of the Franchise parties resembles a strong marriage, as they share common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan also believes that a franchise entrepreneur should be careful when choosing a future franchise provider before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relations: if a dating partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he is in marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess the future contractual partner and to pay attention to the smallest alarm signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchisee providers such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time they have to be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the basis of a successful parent company, the new franchisee providers must again conclude what challenges they have had to face and what skills a new franchiseeer needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise providers may also request the assistance of the franchise advisor in order to create a profile based on the practice of the sector.
McLachlan also points out that, for the first time, there is a lot of help available on CFA's website at lookforafrancise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later, because franchisee providers learn to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchisee entrepreneurs can provide advice and help with the evaluation.
"The first franchise partner's commitment to work contributed significantly to the creation of Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?), says Erik Church, Operational Director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands include companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something that he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs, representing all three brands of the O2E, and he is also a franchise partner of You Move Me, Toronto.
Crush's method for finding a real franchise partner is simple.
"A confidence test we use is to ask ourselves, "Would this person speak to me for a weekend barbecue?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'no', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day searching with them for solutions to major business challenges."
Church also points out that the O2E Brands is largely to thank its franchise structure for its success.
In the corporate organisation, managers often see their position as short-term and lower-level management at a very formal level, while franchise entrepreneurs engage in a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the company's success.
"In the Franchise partnership there are far more good aspects than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such partnership is more difficult, but well managed it produces better results.
Railway delays lower cereal prices in the North of the United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the North Central United States, weeks before a huge crop is expected to put a new pressure on the transport network.
Commercial grain mills in the state of North Dakota only offer farmers $2.7 per bushel - about a dollar less than the guide prices - due, above all, to the cost of securing the capacity of opposing rail routes, traders and agricultural organisations saying.
IN Raw materials
The problems are the most acute of the Warren Buffet in Berkshire Hathaway with BNSF rails and the Canadian Pacific rail company.
The Federal Railways Authority will organise a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, there is a need to use the railways to transport agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delays in train transport increased as the high yield in 2013 followed a very cold winter, which caused the trains to slow down and shorten.
Some farmers believe that the increased transportation of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale plant has excluded grain transport, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a company leader in international grain trade, the cost of securing the use of the train for the storage and transfer of cereals has risen from zero to up to $2,000 to $3,000 per wagon per year.
Someone's gotta pay for it.
"These costs are payable either to the farmer or to the customer," says the director of the grain business.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota's soy beans can grow by more than a third and the spring cereal cane by 16%.
Randy Gordon, President of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we are trying to start a new crop from a clean table, i.e. sufficient storage space for the crop has been exhausted and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transportation of this year's crop smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President responsible for the transport of agricultural products by BNSF, said that the company has reduced the length of long-haul transport (train wagons ordered by customers that have been delivered more than four days) from the peak of early April to about two thousand.
"We've moved from almost all the old crop we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the previous crop left over.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF grain trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "unbalanced", but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all types of products to be transported, such as cereal cane.
The second is due to the difficulty of the Canadian Pacific railway company, which is at 11 per cent lower than in the same period last year, but clearly higher than the lower speeds of the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has told the Railway Controller (Surface Transportation Board) that its changes to the rail order system should improve its ability to handle traffic over the next 15-20 percent crop season.
"The Action Plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more trains every week," said the railway company representative.
Ukraine's crisis may solve NATO's "identity crisis"
Leaders, diplomats and experts from large countries have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the end of NATO's mission to Afghanistan also means the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as can be seen at the NATO summit in Wales in Cardiff this week, with 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of world crises on the list of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the withdrawal of Afghan troops, which was previously a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, a 28-state alliance is needed after Russia has invaded Ukraine, a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just a part of the past.
The world leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and re-engage in defence cooperation.
In some sense NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for something -- and it was in the process of having a fairly significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, Director of the Europe Programme Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also strengthened it.
Obama has also added a new mandate to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy to rapidly defeat popular Islamic state activists in Iraq and Syria.
According to the official opinion, the President will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his tired partners in the war to a military response, especially to a situation that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy for the victory of the extremists, first having clearly stated that "we do not have a strategy".
Western experts have put cautious expectations of Ukraine or the Islamic State in discussing breakthroughs at the summit.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main remedy for the event called the attack by Ukraine.
The officials of the European Union dealt with the matter at the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
US officials pointed out that the countries that Obama is hoping for as main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be anticipated two years ago, when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate controlled the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, the director, made his last speech in his position to say that the organization has almost reached the point of "common military insignificance".
U.S. officials constantly complained that other countries did not achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this objective last year.
Now, though, the White House officials say they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire to see the potential threats of the Member States in their real size.
After the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, "the defence promises are more significant and more important than ever after the end of the cold war," says Charles Kupchan, Director General of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation in favour of Russia’s troubled neighbouring countries.
The President will begin his three-day trip on a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been recycling its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycling in Estonia when a new contingency plan, which will be published this week, is put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in the border states, the officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defence signs.
The amendments present a small risk for NATO, which refrained from setting up permanent bases to demonstrate the kindness of Eastern and Central Europe towards Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it can also be only a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be named public in the course of the discussions before official information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as a long-term, not permanent, diplomat said.
With Putin's powerful "wintery" he's using it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve for Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of the rebel arming of eastern Ukraine and the sending of Russian troops to Ukraine.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has intensified, the West is planning harder sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a power card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American Authority, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40 per cent) and coal (28 per cent), according to Business Insider, which affects Geysar Gurbanov University.
When winter comes to Ukraine within the next four months and the coal mines are in conflict in the eastern part of the country, the Ukrainians will be frozen in their homes when the supply of gas from Russia ceases.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia's energy waste, will help Putin win the war eventually, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid invoices on 16 July.
Previously this month Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt for gas was already $5.3 billion (approximately €4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one's thinking about it (in the winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make things easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to replenish the stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and the time reserved for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not withdraw in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Last month, Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company from Nomura, pointed out that Russia's statements on humanitarian intervention and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened within a few months if Russia can maintain its separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies, unless the Kiev sector pays the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow imports of gas to continue on a temporary basis.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenjuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, told us that the speeches were endless.
He said that Russia would do everything it could to bring gas to the EU countries.
The Liberal Saudi Blogger got 10 years in prison and a thousand riots
The Saudi Court of Justice has maintained a 10-year prison sentence for Raif Badawille, the founder of the Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The sentence includes an additional penalty for a thousand beatings and the fines of a million rial (approximately EUR 200 000).
The judgment was based on the fact that he had set up a website that despised Islam.
On Monday, the judge told AFP of another founder of the organization, Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
As early as July 2013, Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 cases, but the sentence was appealed and re-examined.
It was also complained of in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the transforming humanities"
Madventures published a new book "World Explanation" today, explaining the adventurer's explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Rantala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells of the most significant human assault in his life.
Writer, editor, Madventures second party Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a film show at Kansläistoir and Wednesday begins the second production season of the Docventures.
Until the morning, he has run from place to place.
From the day-to-day day-to-day baby to the day-to-day home and from there to the weekend.
A face-to-face interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there's no time.
In the middle of all the rush he and Madventures on the other half, Tunna Milonoff has had the time to stop and write the World Explanation Book, which, according to the cover text of the book, is an adventurer's manual for everything.
Anything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why culture is worse off than culture, why we are here and who we really are.
We've used interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book contains experts from both professors and artists.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells the I.S.
You've gotten a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the central message of the work?
The need to know more about the world and to ask big questions is worth considering, because then we will be in the best position in this world.
On the other hand, the idea of the book is to be good travel reading, but it is also meant to get people to discuss and share thoughts at home.
The debate can even lead to action, Riku says.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
How does it look?
We ended up with the conclusion that the species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, it is imperative to believe that at some point we are taking solutions to improve our situation.
Earth's a kind of alcoholic.
At first it should admit that we have a problem, only then can there be a change, the Riku philosopher.
Riku tells us that some studies show that Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not added to our happiness.
From this point of view, when there is enough money and our basic need is satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
So we want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
Taking advantage of our natural resources is not enough for a long time, Riku says.
In your book, you will also consider cultural differences.
How does an Indian person differ from the Finnish?
People don't differ greatly.
Of course, there are different starting points for education, health care and hygiene.
Culturally, the biggest difference is that the Community's importance is much greater in India in both good and bad.
When the West is prosperous, people live more alone.
Be isolated from others and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find the right balance between communality and isolation, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
The world has faced a lot of different people.
What is the best way to reach a person in his mind?
It's my childhood, when I was with my family on my first major trip abroad.
We lived in India for a year and in Pakistan while my father was there at the UN.
I was 7 years old, and two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
There was a big moving vehicle coming to Finland.
We drove the war in Afghanistan when there were huge numbers of refugees on the roads.
On the way, a girl of my age walked with her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big sea bench with a cook's can in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age is aware of the situation.
It was one of the revolutionary human encounters that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
In that case, the Riki "goes to the fish" that other people must be respected, even if they were considerably poorer or they had the same conditions of life as we do.
The crime already realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adults, the people who have been confronted in New Guinea rise to the surface.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials for the benefit of everything, not just using money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think.
And to think about it, she wants to have a new book with Tuna.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, look, and listen to more.
To make people work from warm love to conversation or even fisting, Riku throws.
That's what Kauhajoki magazine tells us.
The events started when the couple arrived by bus at the station and they ordered a taxi.
When the cab started moving, a man in the yard threw a taxi at him with an object.
The driver got out of the car, the same man as the passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the man's passenger in a life-threatening way into his head as well as into his hand and left the place.
The firefighter is 170-175-cent tanker, a short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, light, ponytailed woman in the vicinity of the scene.
He's hoping to contact the police.
The police also ask for clues from all those who may have observed events or persons related to the case.
The fire occurred on Wednesday, August 27th, at 19.50 a.m.
"Moi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the net
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article that states that the international research team first managed to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages I sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "me".
In the test arrangement, the electric brain curve of the sender tester was monitored.
The sender was trained by the program to send prayers either by hand or foot by thinking.
The image of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands as one.
This data, coded as bits, was sent through the Internet to the receiver co-person.
The recipient was observed by magnetic stimulation for each bit coded one by flash of light.
The recipient was taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still the field of research in its children's shoes, but they believe computer-aided telepathic communication to be routine in the near future of mankind.
Refugees - Point - Rural Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also pressing for its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action will follow a reaction, respond.
Experience shows that all sanctions are only being imposed in the long term.
Iran was only allowed to enter into negotiations on its nuclear programme after years.
For decades, the South African Bar Association sat in place, despite the fact that trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export top electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put obstacles on the trade side of the world.
The last intervention was to freeze the trade in raw wood.
It is clear that forced Russia will not get on its knees.
The Russians have become accustomed to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the trade is not a cause for panic.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot take milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage to Russia is the abolition of imports of cheese or the export of vodka.
The most serious disadvantages are the limitations of the financial sector.
They'll only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but taking a new one is difficult.
Even if Russia has huge foreign reserves, they will not last forever.
The credit of Russian companies is being cut and money is being expensive.
My own banks can't fund everyone.
We have to push more money or companies will have trouble paying.
Bankruptcy is also bankrupt in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernisation of Russia will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki Sanoma.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would return to Russia once again and bend inwards.
The extraordinary free-pressure event in North Korea was held
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international free press matches held in Pyongyang, the capital on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese player who has become a freelancer, took part in the event from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the free press matches, there were also Taekwondo matches of local athletes.
According to Inok, the goal of the event was to bring the conflicting states closer through sport and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians wished to see improvements between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
In North Korea, the last time we saw international free pressure was seen in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the commodity trading organisation.
The negotiations began in June, when a maximum reduction rate of 130 was estimated.
According to the company, its organisation has now broken down multiple functions and areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK says it is looking for a clear improvement in cost efficiency and synergies between different industries.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the background is a structural change in trade, which has been fuelled by the trade in goods in particular.
The S group's operating goods trade has already been lost for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of the SOK operating and day-to-day goods trade, i.e. a total of about 530 persons.
Turku Statements: Some of the self-care drugs behind the table
According to the paper, there is an increase in the amount of medicines that could be obtained without a prescription, but only after the pharmacist’s advice.
According to the Finnish Pharmacopoeia, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could become the subject of advice.
Following an interview with the pharmacist and in compliance with pre-defined criteria, the medicinal product should be considered by the president of the Swedish Association for Pharmaceuticals, Kirsi Kvarnström Turku.
There are already a few medicines available without a prescription in Finland, but they need advice.
One of these is a follow-up medicine.
Corruption for More Accurate Causes
Finland is paying more and more attention to the fight against corruption.
They have been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the small number of bribe cases and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice's working group will consider the need for a criminal law on the trade and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the case of Patria's bribe case in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlin, one year ago.
In Slovenia, trade in influence brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal name.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, corruption is not much investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the University of Applied Sciences on the risk of corruption in various areas.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he will get the winners for the Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
A lot of Western Sydney Wanderers players are in the first game of the game, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the game of the Champions League witch’s club in Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai on a 10-day training camp, including two friendship games in Abu Dhabi to prepare the team for the first semifinal match to be held on September 17th.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss the trip to Korea, but coach Popovic believes in their helpers.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us," Popovic says.
In China, Tomi Juric was banned from playing this gesture.
After all, it's a setback, no players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes to the place, he's certainly done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to just play against someone in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovic, who will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The soccer team's defender was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will be playing in the return match at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back in the career and he's getting well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him because it means to gradually return to the field.
He's already been practicing a couple of times outside, which is good.
He'll last for a while before he's all right, but he'll be fine.
Dubai's the Wanderers team has world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the big changes of the last season.
"We know this will help players to create bonds," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both in the field and outside.
So we make use of the camp for many purposes.
An elite hamburger pays three times the monthly wage of a worker
01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to belong to the country's elite.
The Financial Times tells of a break-up of the opposites.
In North Korea, informal markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer a concession to wealthy or sparing ordinary citizens who are not accustomed to joining the dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a fun centre with a ticket for up to ten months to pay a regular worker's salary.
You'll get hamburgers out there who'll pay $76.
It's three to five months' pay for the country's usual dune.
At the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "Western Market" started in the 1990s when the country suffered from famine.
The government will allow them to exist, even though the prices of the equipment may at its worst be gross.
Yet, in Pyongjang, the capital, many have a cell phone with a cost of $200.
The cause may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create a self-energy and a youthful image.
In his time, the government has emphasized the importance of technology in the country's flourishing.
Turku Book Fair moves from France to Sastamala
The theme of the Turku Book Fair, to be held at the beginning of October, is France and Sastamala.

The trade fairs are also marked by topical debates, including President Sauli Niinistö, writer Sofi Oksanen and Congressman Jörn Donner (r).
The programme manager of the trade fair is Jenni Haukio, spouse of President Niinistö.
Ormston House: Stormont Council wishes for sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it will have found the buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that paid taxpayers nearly 3 000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern part of the city from the 19th century and paid nine million pounds for it.
The Council failed to continue to sell the building, when security and maintenance of the building came to pay the Council some 400 pounds a day.
The building was recently sold at £1.25 million.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
In 2001, the Council purchased a building of 9 million dollars in class B of historical value, as it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building is not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was put back for sale at a price of GBP 2,5 million this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, the Ulster Unionist Party, Mike Nesbitt, suggested that Ormston House perhaps fit into the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will enter into negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent on the identity and selling price of the buyer.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormisto House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police force that preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
The security costs of Ormisto House by the beginning of this year amounted to GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs to GBP 371 379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was GBP 250 015 and the development and design professionals' fees were GBP 212 466.
The building was previously owned by the ship builder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when he bought Harland’s business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
"Eparability Increases": Helsinki intends to reduce school assistants
Saving is not born, claims JHL.
Helsinki is preparing for a radical reduction in the number of school-specific assistants.
The reduction would not apply to a child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to cut down a total of some 2.7 million from the resources of the school helpers.
There are a total of about 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the reductions occur, they will enter into force between the beginning of the semester.
According to JHL, the decision will increase inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy for donors to reduce because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not the result, on the contrary, the workload of teaching staff is increasing.
The schoolchildren’ savings increase the risk of falling from learning objectives, and the sharing of teachers is tough as well,” stresses JHL’s industry director, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki are disparaging from schools, as young schools and students in need of support will no longer receive assistance at all with future resources.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
The resultant preventive work is just being done by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Agency have been directed towards this group for the most part.
This will continue to affect all parties.
In autumn, the City Council of Helsinki will make a final decision on the resources, which I hope for the vision and wisdom of looking forward to the future and to act in line with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel’s Power on the West Bank
The women of Israel walk to Gevaot in the Jewish settlement of Etzion, near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in the Jewish settlement area near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the area, and at the same time defies the Palestinian demand not to build more settlements and defies the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli 'peace now' group, which is opposed to the expansion of the settlements of the West Bank, believed that the events of Sunday could be the largest single land invasion in the West Bank region for decades and could 'sequently change the situation in the region'.
The Palestinian aim is to establish a state of its own in countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to Israel’s authorities, the political junta for assessing the situation in the land became after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after their elevatoring area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the land invasion suggests that it was meant to be a form of compensation for the population of settlement and punishment for the Palestinians.
The land in the Etzion settlement area of the Jewish Gevaot settlement in southern Jerusalem has now been officially declared "the land of the state" when it was previously under the private ownership of the Palestinians. This was a necessary step in order for Israel to begin planning buildings in the area.
However, the mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFa that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday orders declaring Israel to take control of countries containing the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to carry out a restoration of discipline on the West Bank against the Islamist group ruling Gaza, Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The subsequent tensions at the border of Israel and Gaza marked a 50 - day war that ended last week in a ceasefire in Egypt.
The conquest of the land has quickly brought attention to the West Coast dominated by the Israelis and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which make it more difficult for Israel and Palestine to develop further the peace process.
The crisis in Lapland is usually a multi-problem situation.
More and more of the municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, evidenced by the well-being study carried out by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences of Lapland.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the Professor, the reduction in the functions of municipalities by EUR billion is not enough.
Common features of crises include weak urban economy, poor employment and migration losses.
Asko Suikkanen, professor of sociology at the University of Lapland, says that new crisis centres are coming from the western border and from eastern Lapland.
In the survey survey survey, residents assess the situation in their country quite realistically.
In the study, residents of well - maintained municipalities even looked at the views, from a pessimistic point of view.
Strong expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present everyday life and well - being will be maintained, perhaps even a little better.
In this time, it is not dared to think about longer-term investments, such as the purchase of a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The research team surprised the great differences between municipalities.
For example, per capita expenditure on income support ranges from a couple of ten to over EUR 100.
The municipal tax revenues per capita range from EUR 2 thousand to EUR 4400.
According to the season, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How the money is used, how much government contributions are made and what is the degree of debt, is very different from the local authorities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close the borders of Islamists returning to the country
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters from Iraq and Syria to their homeland.
It's a matter of telling the BBC about the sources of government.
According to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism should, however, retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals considered.
The proposal is currently being finalized and Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it more difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the authority of the authorities so that they could temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain increased the possibility of terror to the second highest level.
Bob Carr rejoices at the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from the Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from Libyan prison today.
The Federal Government rejoiced at the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The representative of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr, said that 'everything is going well' and that the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released from the Australian authorities tonight, and then he will be on the plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are happy with the news that she is likely to be released today," the representative commented to the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before continuing his journey home to The Hague.
On 7 June Taylor and three of his colleagues in the Criminal Court were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintan, in the presence of Seif al-Islam, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to Libyan authorities, Taylor took to Seif papers that they felt threatened national security.
Senator Carr's been in a lot of trouble to free Taylor, including traveling to Libya's capital in Tripoli last month to drive this thing.
Taylor couldn't have talked to his husband or his little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after David Ritchie’s visit to Australia.
Carr also spoke with John and Janelle, who lived in Taylor, Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally given a phone call.
Taylor’s parents had called on Libya to release her daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other lawyers arrested by the Criminal Court are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Mr Carr said a week ago that as a result of the debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the lawyer was sorry and apologized for the possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to thoroughly investigate the actions of its team after its members have returned home.
"The investigation decided by the International Criminal Court will ensure that all those who have been wrong will be given due judgment," the Court announced in its press release last month.
The International Criminal Court is calling for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam on crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended surprisingly last year.
According to Tripolin, his trial should be local and made an initiative on 1 May in which he announced that he did not accept the decision of the criminal court to hold the trial in The Hague.
Young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but Villarreal did not fall home easily.
The Blues threw their heads into Villarreal's watch, Sergio Asenjo, until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
A surprising man made the victory: 19-year-old, his first appearance in La Liga, the attacker Sandro Ramirez had come to the field just 12 minutes earlier.
A young man from Barcelona’s second team invited to the mission was close to finishing after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess’s company.
Collection for the Ferguson police ended secretly after a $433,000 overrun.
The maintainers closed two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend, collected over $400,000 for the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
Two separate pages on the GoFundMe Charity Site open to the public, bearing similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected $235,750 and $197,620 for the ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
The same site maintained by Brown’s family lawyer had collected $314,099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by many weeks of unrest and demonstration, mostly against the almost white police force living in the black Ferguson, who forced Wilson to hide while trying to decide, in local and federal investigations, whether to shoot Brown for no reason.
Some of Wilson’s defences have been raised by the network’s collection campaigns, especially since some of the visitors had commented on racist comments that have since been removed.
Apparently, both sides stopped receiving donations largely at the same time on Saturday, and the page maintainers did not give reason for this.
While visiting the site, trying to give a donation, he sees a message saying, "Don't accept gifts anymore!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of the GoFundMe site gave a press release to the Los Angeles Times that did not prevent donations.
"Every organiser of the GoFundMe campaign will decide when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, representative of the GoFundMe site.
Organizers may also continue to receive donations at a later date if they wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a yield of $197,620, maintains the Shield of Hope, a charitable group composed of police from St. Louis, a recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe site.
Three police officers, Joseph Eaga, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Rourda, who were registered as official representatives of the Shield of Hope, did not respond as soon as Sunday to e-mails requesting further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official agent of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council in close proximity and a member of the Roorda Missouri House of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected 235,750 dollars. He has not been confirmed as a recipient of donations approved by the site.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe site, in his newsletter to The Times, confirmed that there is no nameless benefit.
Few information has been provided to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, unlike the operators of another Wilson page or Brown website.
Two weeks ago, a message was sent to visitors on the Wilson page of the site stating that the site is cooperating with the Shield of Hope to become officially approved recipients of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The author provided additional information to the desired visitors via the password of the Gmail e-mail address, but did not reply as soon as Sunday to the request for further information.
In its press release to The Times, GoFundMe said that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results of the main website and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website that require a functioning Facebook account to be used".
The information security practices of GoFundMe invite users to "give only to GoFundMe users they know personally and trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
According to Mr Little, GoFundMe has, however, "been in touch with the campaign organizer, and there is no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundWe can also arrest all collected funds if there is a need to start research in the context of any campaign.
However, GoFundWe have not considered it appropriate to arrest the funds collected for this campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns supporting Wilson, told the following page that during the weekend lawyers are trying to find "selection", why the donors of the GoFundMe site have been prevented from giving, but did not provide any other additional information.
The Facebook page also has an anonymous maintainer and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top attackr on the end of the year - Valioliga - Night-Sanomat

Wenger struggled for a fresh acquisition at the top of Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday in the karsinta final of the Champions League against Bevisus.
Arsenal won 1-0 on Sanchez's goal.

Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous criminal writers and the popular Silta series, is preparing a new TV series.
