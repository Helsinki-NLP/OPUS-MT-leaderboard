Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement building in Israel and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The Iranian nuclear programme has further deteriorated the relationship between the two through the deal announced by Obama.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu had given a controversial speech, which was partly regarded as an affront against Obama.
The speech had not been given to Obama, a meeting had been rejected by Obama with reference to the election to be held in Israel at that time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat sad voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scratched on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she's the only woman that ever loved me." This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call someday afterwards.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police put him in.
One day after the shooting in the university, the students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented, but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "Wonderful People" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies toward problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After his escape from the campus, the police later found Lambs' trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running at the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of the long-standing friends of Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the female swarm at the time.
All the girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had been friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played the gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a lightened bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonics game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were on the clean-up and joked about each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight event.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwake, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call Prentiss called him his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it won't employ as many Christmas season workers as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to employ 40,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 people were employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start this month with application interviews and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "undoubtedly the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks in surveys, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit field, and some began to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipic vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "wrong" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "excited" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next one in a lot of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "wrong" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a superior commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his duties, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not pass into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly guard, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who will win the GOP most, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP selectors consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans collected around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is diffused to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-on-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump won the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-on race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say that they never change their mind.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "compromising" two months ago in his election speech, immigration was a turning point in the public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s decisive Hispano-American expression will be kept away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight, it will apparently do Donald Trump too.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now lack about half the support of Republican voters, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Iowa republicans are frustrated about Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "suddenly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobokenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt.
In the street, a square metre of a reed roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited", it says in the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations costs a square metre the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student budget in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top apartment, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices in staggering heights.
There are times several ten thousand euros - no - per square meter, well noticed.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is by the way not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern-Traumstart thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalie in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their start game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned by 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bayern leadership, Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had one shot of the World Champion passed as a flank thought.
"We will not underestimate them," had Bayern-Capitän Philipp Lahm promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously ran to work in their offensive efforts, but often unintentionally.
The attacks were initiated too often by a game shift to the left of Douglas Costa, who rarely went through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left pocket.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave up the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown beat the Polish headball off the line (26.).
Then by direct take, the goalkeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarias raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needlesticks.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was leaving.
Like when he took a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before the new one, Guardiola had a four-ring chain defended with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the cadre, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero only gave green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Simmer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something else out of it, that's bad already".
Guardiola also decided against him during the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59.).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, Muller put another one on it at an 11 meter.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a small group of partly maimed Bayern fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces seized and went ahead with beatings against the Munich followers.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium injured.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a long-term Potsdam study.
The good news: If you don't, the risk will fall quickly.
Smokers have a markedly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk for smokers to lose their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gum, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
The extent to which smoking increases the risk for caries was not clarified.
People who quit smoking may, however, reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years to reduce the risk again to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham University explained.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, said study manager Heiner Boeing of DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to be smoked is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, over 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologneer Rheinufer on the remains of the latentike
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for several times.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological soil monument care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it had already been known that there was a fortress in place in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves had been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of freight train
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has been injured, the Federal Police ask the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman from the train station building crossed the track at the end of the railway platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, she suffered most serious injuries from it.
She was treated in an emergency on site and taken by rescue personnel to a hospital.
No information is available to the investigating officials on the reason for the young woman's night crossing.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarter Straße (L364) come into question.
Information about the cause of the accident can be found on the telephone number 0800/6888000 or any other police station, which can be operated around the clock and free of charge.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to ease the dispute over the proposed Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private conciliation bodies for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning is clearly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that will trust the citizens," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish Government intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of current arbitration procedures provide in concrete terms for the EU and the US to jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries in the same way.
There is also a second instance for the first time.
It would allow opposition to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months it had become clear that citizens were not familiar with the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, according to its own information, it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified.
The investor-state dispute proceedings (ISDS) mainly required by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitral tribunals are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, can lift national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the proposals of the European Commission insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe business association warned against restricting the scope for action by the economy through too many new rules.
This could affect particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
When discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) Free Trade Agreement were concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer sustainable.
Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his tiny and delicately arranged songs, using various places that he repeatedly records on the map.
Where they were born and how they looked there, in his home country.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative fool.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greenings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can always drift into great opulent drifts.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a confused series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be resounded accordingly.
But already in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks some expectations positively.
I'm sorry, but Stevens is acting down here.
Live enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the New York musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinois") a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Exceeding ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any of the top names of the influential music media.
After highly productive experiments Stevens then uses very extensive electronic spare parts on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still orchestrated by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Along with the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage concert.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs banished here, Stevens returns to intimacy and folk, which has become much more mature.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw away the "plate in principle".
Only for an addition did Stevens thank himself modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows to applause.
Jeremy Corbyns' debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns' debut has been highly expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, during the National Anthems singing on Tuesday, the decision of the Labour President to hold a memorial celebration on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several title-page-stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said that he "had stood in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "hero of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour president to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, relying on differences in economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and limiting profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labour and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman, David Cameron, who since becoming Tory Chief, has been opposed to the Dispatch Box in Parliament for the past decade.
The Labour president, who promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that it will avoid both "stupidity" and conflicting with hooks and instead has undertaken to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadows of the Minister for Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also introduced the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "casterle theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
As it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgement of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Schossed in Joburg': homeless teenagers trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose steeply according to data showing an increase in UK wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and made estimates since 2009 of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar at $1,5505 and rose to 0.84% compared to the euro at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % leap after the takeover offer of rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again showed growth.
Glencore shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a fall of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his rating on "sells" for the company.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the semester.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports Managing Director Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and this could mean less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a hangover with super sweet frieze.
The type with platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is spinning.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish sits on the cold stone tops of Berlin's luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose posters have been hanging together in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much the day as her mom deserves in six months.
If that's all right.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who's juckt?
Not the fans.
Neither is Bieber himself.
He's taken care of anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars on the beaver account.
And with every doll who looks like he and over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window pane.
More than 100 million he's supposed to have taken.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber was finally in the USA and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album should follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebanese to Cartoffeldöner-Idee
Potatoes or doners?
Both are going - in the cartoffeldöner, which Oldenburg imbisowner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Cartoffel instead of Doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea was that a poster would bring him to a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln instead of Doner", which he had seen by chance on television.
Since then, there has been a barbeque in his shop, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is a multikulti for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has since been applied to the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model there.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spear contains, therefore, Alhay does not want to betray.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together", he finds.
The culinary understanding of peoples is also good with its customers.
Metcash Launches Soil Resistency Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA affiliates from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump aboard, with brands like Dunsborough Icemaker Simmo, who distribute samples in IGA stores and sell shop owners cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA loading operations and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that after opening its first markets, Aldi will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the truest.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's food and food business revenues will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member made contact with Mr Douglas's last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and Metcash's food and food trade income, which provides approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores with fast-growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shop restructuring programs will be Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as the "Special Ks", came into the spotlight by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, calling Harrison, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis player after a convulsion of Richard Gasquet's potential U.S. open victory, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the UK.
"One thing I'm getting pretty excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn into the dispute a little," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost because of a seizure in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a battling of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too tight.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is trained hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think I'm right, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally. Everything with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s country and Serbian officials responded with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants scanned "Open the Border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian standby police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
One day after the 28-nation block, the turbulences at the Hungarian-Serb border could not agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would absorb another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The crisis in two southern regions, proclaimed on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could lock up roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that his country also plans to build a wire fence along his border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become a major narrowing point and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming refugees are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4 metre (13 foot) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also establish higher penalties for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovac's reporter in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree in procedural terms with the military's deployment, which is expected for next week, but Reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a state security advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes according to the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to penetrate there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia's main motorway connection and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
The former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to take a two-digit lead in the democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second to none, with 27 percent (increased by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his candidacy for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has won some.
Clinton has a great advantage for women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a great advantage with the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and the choice are also cited.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see it in the race - although a third believe that he should not.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who for the party would be their second choice, Biden is at the top of the list.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden's second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to compete for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about election.
Similar to last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters appears unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results with some important characteristics of voters in their party's pre-elections.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about it.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term of office as a foreign minister, most of the democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public overall.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated even further.
It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for them under registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters throughout the country also regard Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades with leadership.
Biden, Carson and Bush cut the six tested candidates best with honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson steps up close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now lack half the support of voters in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing their jobs.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well-attracted by demographic groups and that Trump is superior to higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, ranging from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, which was released last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - he ends up with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
Looking at a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side tips for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's belief.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Although peaks are measured only remotely, bathing holidaymakers already have a trip to the Mediterranean Sea to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go to the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Almost two years after a student's death during a shocking ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, there are murder charges filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with connected eyes, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, said the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and Andy Meng, contacting the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said Chief of Police Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, deng was repeatedly added to the head, buttock and thigh with blunt force.
"To many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the brotherhood. At least one student has died from the harassment since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be accounted for, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A county Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with shocking attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has, officially or unofficially, sanctioned this, we will also take this into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases its interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and households are going to turn, yields for bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to move into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on the way forward.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the day, however, market participants could find that the overall excitement was possibly exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US tines to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," German bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed increases in interest rates.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend - around 14 percent - in the past 35 years on the way to rising interest rates, rather flat in the next 250 days (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4% according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on the stock will begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often encourage higher interest rates.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is quite remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the event of an interest rate increase in the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "if it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants throughout the year focused on an Fed raise, and everyone's eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all the upswing cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with an increasing rate of GDP growth and quickly put the pre-recession peaks in the shadow of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the upswing cycle the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to yields closer to longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flater, credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit from this if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with high debt will be worse off, as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest rates," said Goldman Sachs-Analyst in a report for the customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded, on average, 5 percentage points of each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts on average by 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points respectively.
Debt will be a major problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure share game, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher returns, even if experts differ in their opinion on how quickly this will take place.

Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something the private transmitters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station should be "dumb" and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seem to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you actually just imitate what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to order new works, I really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, made it possible to step on the feet of commercial rivals.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated cost of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "on special BBC way".
He added, he wished the company "to find a hit from our own stable" when next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats from the fee-payers.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday has slowed down the issues in November
For over a decade virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go down until 2000, then over time this has always developed," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the drop in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year five times the average number of buyers flocked around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for bargains, could deter buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending, slightly more than £1 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially loads the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that in addition, a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mecca's Great Mosque.
Suffering, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The procession of mourning passed on to the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on to the prayers.
The bodies were released for funeral when the Saudi King imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured persons.
The bodies of 29 beavers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already committed firmly that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin load group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which plunged into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsh, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not having taken current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca's Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden-Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was deprived of his family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
This leads to the opening of 200 more Srawfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales outlets will close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British will put down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their home country.
If you can deal with a hammer or brush in a clever way for painting walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Because British people are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform homeworkers jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at lowest prices has now been out of date.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men prevail with the employees.
She said it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It's still working a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions about the purchase of products by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year profit and sales after the group straddled the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open up 200 new branches.
Aich/Dob officials for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Chancellor Aich/Dob were forced to take responsibility for infidelity and misrepresentation.
The defendants did not confess guilty.
One of them had also been accused of maladministration.
He was legally released from this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation had crystallized that the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
It amounts to around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact differed from the chairman of the Schopensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
The defense claimed that the association did not have an asset disadvantage at any point in time as the betrayal of the infidel.
The sports employees would have only charged expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to some 600,000 shillings in 2001 (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Do we continue to run the club or lock it up?" one of the defendants, in the bread trade, told the big business auditor of the finance office.
He and his colleague and co-defendant then decided to take up this task.
With all the risks.
"We have advanced money, put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the agreement.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of such a financial success, the payment of the expenses would have been decided retroactively by 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, starting in 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, both flat-rate and non-detailed bookings appeared, the former commander explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the club.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial disclosure, it was only important to have the freedom of debt, so the answer.
When in 2011 against the one functional investigation for abuse of office began, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That was the case, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was, according to his statement, not known to the club.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time the respondent knew no answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-accused had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "reimbursement of damages".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he disagreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With this, you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functionary said he never earned a cent, he only charged miles of money and diets.
He had charged the club 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years were not available to the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an operating test in which everything was deemed to be correct, they explained.
Kilometer money had also been transferred to the second defendant.
All the inquiries were made in cash, and he had to go from his place of residence in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main discussion will continue on 23 September with the interview of Witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard removes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cuts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) won't end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer sector.
The company announced on Tuesday that it would save $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion).
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will start in the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs that has been going on for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP employed around 302,000 people.

The group from Palo Alto, California, which has grown up with printers, is currently divided: the computer and printer business should be bundled into a new company this year – apart from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock market.
Once again disappointing PC sales as well as weaker demand from corporate customers for their services, the world's second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo recently increased.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
The proceeds thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split-up and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee a total reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in the fighting in Iraq, however, would largely be rejected: 54 per cent voted against, 35 per cent voted in favour.
61 percent of other states are positive about air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against engaging in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, and 20 percent would do so.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The trade fair will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility by 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility combines" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association still expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water jets at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik experienced the outbreak of violence at the border crossing point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
In the meantime, a police line had formed and behind the police was a waterthrower ready.
From 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials started using continuous pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
==References====External links==
The refugees have now withdrawn a little in the meantime.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who breathed the tear gas cried.
Other refugees packed together and suffered from shortness of breath.
The Serbian police press officers also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. notes bank
The world is watching when the U.S. Bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether the interest rates have been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was last week's view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and that the interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to opt for an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Death Protector at Delta State University left a letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later on the day shot and killed his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it "does him harm" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," announced authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but that will "no one bother", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it come back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening, when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "three-way relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who's 19, and she was "destructed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss' daughter was "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, has met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life-laure on the University's website indicates.
Stars that have lost their lucky ones
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also alleged to be fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all of that will require his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save with a better organisation.
150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the Group's conversion to work.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and values Eurowings' guardians.
The aim of the reorientation was to contribute around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost route should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future for the board of directors of Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 strong employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the Pilot Association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations after the halted strike will be resumed on Thursday.
That's what the union told us.
The topic of the discussions is the retirement scheme for pilots.
The cockpit wants to come to viable results as soon as possible "in a year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between the trade union and Airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the "Wings" savings concept is the background.
It foresees that Lufthansa will deploy Eurowings to the Group's own low-cost Eurowings in the fight against competing routes.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defenseman cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was hospitalized.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then fantastic, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't be playing in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11 meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Relating to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defenseman has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a break in his leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland-Team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked as if it had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about this.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a play by Chris Smalling.
Sure David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take you long to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's environmental label, which appeared in 1971, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "delightful, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give an image or a message that we've missed so far."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the act of the book, instead presents a content statement of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," says Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this wasn't suspicious enough yet: The text presented by Cameron read in part as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the work of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is being ruined by the money-crazy, tree-crowded, thneed-stitching Once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a hot, snow-eared being "speaking in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an external victory.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear any scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size on a test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth quits from the England-Test-kader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he's hoping to take another run for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team-man.
The question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation you can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trutt in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales's coming in, and he's a hit man I'm up to.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must be given at least the same opportunities as before him, but this naturally depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of hitting moeen next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a drummer can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a devil guy from Cricket.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some wise additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test consultant could be a master's pair.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the previously said.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team members do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not easily taken.
The Brexit layer (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could get started if the economy started to fall asleep by the year 2017
David Cameron's unfailing renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper in trouble with every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is violently breaking up over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is now and not always due to their own guilt, are satisfied with the UK's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive Treaty changes that they do not want to do.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its Annual Meeting that it does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside inside the EU tent - "Let's not go alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capital cities have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it happened with the exaggerating long-time exaggerates such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a vibrating force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain may have a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear out a leg to help the selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar Separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful remarks, all in SNP style, while UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "United Kingdom has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press baron, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the ore Euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU-level bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-picking foreigners and the pseudo non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similar about them, but he found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him, instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum whirl, because Blair had put the principle of the EU's unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never got away with it either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly blow on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake back then and today.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in the process of development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue dye trend and the wilder threads of Tory's small Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on the radio and on television this week when the Scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father was on television trying to be unfair to his Labour cabinmates without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow Members according to all the reports at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the throes of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks that way.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government's power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
Claims from a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extra-windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "building on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" was based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called up to develop a model for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead to a synthesis of their views on the damage to various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director should have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that they would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International prior to reporting.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry-financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco management also participated in the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significant" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there has been no evidence that e-cigarettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims were previously responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to have the long-term effects to study.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is evidenced and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Head of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in very controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of stations like BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years at Channel 4 he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly demonstrated by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of its study on the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give your production to programs that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be funded, even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both of their own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm to do so.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think this would even reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC's debt to hunting is assessed "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their sham-holy missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put her in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see her.
At the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that for 150 £ per year you get a great value here, but for people who are for 150 £ a lot of money, ask me if that is true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission "to inform, form and maintain".
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example at public television stations in Australia and Canada in "inform, clarify and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful is shown on television, and with commercial channels to get alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuro cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further information: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fad worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoreuros carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblows and transferred into the worms, where they switch on the modified motoreuros.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down at the desired point in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can easily pass tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your front door!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Have a look at Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Trade Show video.
Terrible killer drones!
Pedestrian leg restraints!
Strürbomben!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this announcement for the world's largest arms trade fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International in order to shed light on the British government's willingness to arm repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
Related: DSEI arms trade fair: authoritarian regimes flowing to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you travel with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) you can read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line that turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a flock of arms dealers will drive with DLR ... customers will be asked to help with the stop of the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Gracious Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys that claim "to access about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this placatier "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trading placates greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty location of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic mischievous corporate advertising, but "by blushing with bright colors and animation it remains stronger."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be dealt with illegally in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors gather fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a " uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding impact effects inside the target."
Whatever this does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have been angry with - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student residences ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It's enticing to shake: people tell you where you're from, whether and where you've taken the Sabbath year, where you've been with Corbyn and why you're "honestly Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were set on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks-receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and dress up.
Related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space-bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow member of society is exhausted - and send him a text instead of knocking.
Upon knocking: Do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-manie, knocking at the doors of people is to imagine yourself with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked something for you. So, and now smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow citizens feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check this out with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say they serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more in a more balanced way than my roommate who added a rinsing agent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it mattered to them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let her neighbours sleep for another two hours before she made her own music cry, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future spouse to randomly move into the same student home?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be really embarrassing if you thought you were a roommate to your future spouse, ran into her, split up and then had to see her every day and maybe live along with her as she pulls all her friends over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot fellow resident is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk your lower body a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson on safety - but never simmer someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't thank your belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds series houses in the middle Franconian corner for people who don't have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show you how to build well and cheaply even today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to quickly create affordable housing: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people remain here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal three-storey house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different if you put people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are being built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their respective needs.
How much are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
It's just... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
Six months of construction took us.
That is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: By building law, I have properly carried out my project.
It always makes it particularly complicated the threatening Damoklesschlagt special construction and the parking regulations.
Horrible.
It is still assumed who creates three apartments in a rowhouse needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities lacks space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their series house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you exacerbate the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I'll show you how you can build well and cheaply today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that tells us that the "software update has failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the storm goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by relieving the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may deactivate halfway and this may lead to a breakdown of the update.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one more motto in the Formula 1 World Championship battle against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
Before the start of the World Cup, the World Cup second stressed in the seven decisive overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve races and is also a favorite in the city state for the floodlight-Grand-Prix.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has joined another member in its ranks, increasing the membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the court.
Gauselmann is the holder of the first class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by the chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of its association with the spa town.
Quartiersbureau is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have gathered under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will immediately receive information on issues such as healthcare insurance or health insurance services.
For years, we have been seeing with our outpatient care service that often caring families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Nevertheless, many of the cashier's services are not used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Citizen's Hospital and for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.
The offers from the Seniors Centre and Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre", Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis explained.
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre is that both managing directors see demographic change in particular.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the inauguration ceremony, the quarter office also dedicated itself to the association at an age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to enabling seniors to live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been set for the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, against the third leagueist Würzburger Kickers, the date was now set as 6 October.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against third-party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
Play will take place on Tuesday October 6th at 19th at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will go over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hummer, who also points to the pre-sale of tickets now started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special attraction.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and won 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2) at home.
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of Vienna's doyens, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as reported by the Künstlerhaus on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to establish the treasure chamber in the Hofburg in Vienna and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking: Tim Wiese throws police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed bad things in Bremen.
Football was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged with Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have spent 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
He didn't intellectually put it on the other side.
Wiese had her hair cut in downtown Bremen just when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a penalty bill for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of business, insulted the officer and threw the due penalty at her feet, as the "image" magazine reports.
With the city of Bremen the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under examination," it says of the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not meadow is displayed.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rain forest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideally suited for the growth of marijuana plants.
The Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants for three days and burning them.
Men blaspheme on 17-year-old Afghans
Witness the police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
There were also three persons on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the young man and struck him with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a break in the nose and bleeding sharply out of his nose.
When his two friends hurried and distressedly talked to the thug, he left his victim at first.
His friends brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and went there demonstratively several times.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a bat, the face and thighs of the victim were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about five feet tall.
The second bat was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and notifiers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also the pleasure of Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, Economic Supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is missing luck: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at his side with half a seat in the next months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist medical training at the Verden hospital and wants to take up practice in the next year as well.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Muller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself as his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family father Frank Müller has also grown up there, his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior doctor in Sulingen, was also appointed as a senior emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteered in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new head.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to settle down as house doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load ECGs and need more talk room.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
A total grant of 50000 euros is granted to the Müllers under a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," stresses Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, with an average of about 500 patients in northern Germany.
There is another home doctor’s practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's speaking hour will continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
Their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, after all, the doctors practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
After a long time, they feel a little sadness.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many times," says the intern.
Her husband's laughingly complements: "We have a 6000 square meter plot."
"So far I've always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being raised at our southern border," said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Minister of the Interior.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It remains to be seen that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
Human care and safety are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Sloven border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia Considers " Corridor" - Slovenia Denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to allow incoming refugees to continue to Austria and Germany and possibly also build corridors for the refugees.
This was not the view of the Interior Minister, Vesna Györkös Znidar, in Laibach, however.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will instead intensify border surveillance - especially in Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, however, Slovenin does not want to limit his borders for refugees.
"Every EU member has to fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried during the night hours of Tuesday to get past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in Eastern Croatia to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly entering Tovarnik in Croatia since then.
It deals mainly with Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross were already in operation.
In the coming days his country will count with about 4000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serb border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would redirect Croatia towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, disputes that it is wise for people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to," it was said.
In any case, according to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city Sid in the early days, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had travelled through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has made it, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue their journey to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, this could lead to the already predicted shift of observers from the former Balkan route Turkey-Greece- Macedonia-Hungary-Hungary-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatia's Minister of the Interior, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations for a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive possibilities for border control".
Close controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a part of this since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently presented a good witness to the country as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the past night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is unclear.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border was closed in Horgos on Wednesday morning.
It would not currently be very high numbers of refugees.
One cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps of alternative routes marked by Croatia to refugees.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are still unencumbered minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minerners had been sent in the border region.
Stock Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians Pay 30 Million Dollars
Supranonok is said to have heard of a ring of cyber criminals, accused of having repeatedly gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is intended to have been used to carry out insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, in this way more than 100 million dollars were agitated.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," it says in the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 more defendants in that case lasted.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have operated both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Help Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a lot of work to do.
People do their cares, partly fast steps, partly cozy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at Paradeplatz.
Keeping track.
Pulsating, pulsating life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
With this action, the ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and sees itself confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, that's why we went into the middle of the city with action and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passersby as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteer staff.
While some a passerby spontaneously grasps the chalk and complements the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "with the camper going through the USA", "stop the war" or "not suffering long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
There are always small discussions on the action itself, on life, on how to deal with dying on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that for me at some point the end is coming to this world, can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonische Werke Mannheim, who together with the Caritasverband is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone would like to communicate publicly on the tables, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death was still covered by taboos, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The companion of the death and mourning is one of the volunteer employees of the first hour.
By personal experience faced with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by way of a call, it immediately reported and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanying the affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
"I see life from another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of confession.
Financial support for the health funds and donations of members and associations enables the training, training and supervision of the death and mourning attendants.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal requests for postcards can also be recorded there.
Mixed FedEx result, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell by over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a factset survey of $10.84.
Despite price increases, the outlook is lower, which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it would expect earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts interviewed by Zack's investment research.
Revenues rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to stagnating sales in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight business.
In premarket trading, about one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stratien spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it's time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening to them at an end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has a twofold mandate from the Congress: to maintain stability in maximizing US employment and prices.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. On Thursday, it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to start off from the unprecedented incentive to be weaned by the close to zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself makes the financial market insecure.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
The financial markets, however, expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the hit by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228,89 points or by 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "she has to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
In spring and early summer Yellen had said that, despite the complaints from Liberals, that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which has been lowest for more than seven years and close to the Fed level of full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation was constantly below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world were collapsing at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
In May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% below its peak, when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the dow now almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the reins at this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Note Bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "enforce" its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Asset Management Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not to be linked to the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a qualified member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognisable impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.
The latest turbulences are not close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should precipitate time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market, which is also sold to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/stock is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes more than an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is located near the cash desks and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgants, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She is also still happy to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly explain to women the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking at breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily intake of calories by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Berneder sports hall
The municipality council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar installation.
The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau at the Berner Lieder sports area are progressing step by step: the prepared building request was unanimously endorsed at the recent municipal council meeting without major discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for an "exception" or "liberation" from the current building plan.
The "exception" concerned permission for a special form of roof construction.
Accordingly, a "Satedelach with a non-middle first and roof top" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderfully large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the inclination of the roof, which for energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roof slope does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bernese municipal council usually conducts more restrictive requests for exemption.
However, Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project between the municipality and SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are charged at costs.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sport funding.
In the next stage of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land Council Office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is reflected in the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by country councilwoman Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this matter will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and the Supervisory Board will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the Peißenberg hospital.
The vast majority are to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms were there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schaugau Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fisher" came into play as to who should follow the game, who said he was willing to take over the leadership and move with his team to Shanghai from 1 October.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case means an "upgrading" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for cardiac pacers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
As a transitional measure for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses, until next year the former hospital of the pub, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital was completed.
Landraitin Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, resisted rumors that the house, which is in the possession of the federal shortage, will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I will rule that out." As with the property, Jochner-Weiss could not say there are several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of Caritas and a day-to-day psychiatry.
"What could not happen better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not return," said Fischer about the Quasi move to Lech, which had been "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
There has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked to take over the post of medical director by his colleagues.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 p.m.) at Bergische HC.
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superiority.
In the last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernten on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg district) several hunters were employed, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was initially unclear.
We've got the detectives.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violence crimes
One suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted killing the young people and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday fell victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor's office and the police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, is considered to be suspected of having confessed the crime and led the investigators to the site of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the previous evening after a visit to a Fall Festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-olds.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted in the police interrogation that the 16-year-old had killed and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought before the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
The purpose of the investigation is to find out the facts of the case.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that has already been overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing Construction".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This leaves 140,000 apartments missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception facility.
Many then enter the housing market and join the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were missing in the urban areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals lived in large cities in need in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluute on the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square metres per head had for the first time fallen again in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing Construction" proposes a new start.
New incentives are to boost social housing.
In this way, the property tax could be waived and the property tax on supported dwellings suspended for a limited period.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee housing at the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available EUR 300 million had already been called up at 184 million on Monday evening.
Now the project could even be upgraded.
Refugees have free lead: Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no more breakthrough, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to allow transit via Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the separation of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left Croatia to arrive in Western Europe.
500 people had crossed the Tovarnik border, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
On the day before, Hungary had closed its border for refugees.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning.
Most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this end: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine clearances should now quickly create a safe passage.
In Hungary, however, hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the gate close on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws criminalise the overcoming and damaging of the border fence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged.
Sentenced persons are at risk of imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications had been received in the newly established "transit zones" on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition from Röszke.
The applicants included 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
Practically, however, no one has any chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lock grids were dismantled and one of the warehouses in the border location was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants remained in the country, however, according to government statements.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent with suitcases," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was concluded for them in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and heated the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the Near Passau.
Previously, we have eaten the unexpected guests first, with juice and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was obvious to us," said Stadler in the OÖN speech.
They were very grateful.
A man didn't let himself be taken to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased with this," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau in order to try to reach the border after the short notice that the train traffic was stopped in Germany.
The regional train was removed from the Wernstein am Inn border.
In Wernstein the crossing is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday gerily, tags before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us further Zig thousands is a logical result of a sham-holy policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to build structures to guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has taken the Hungarian government's position in the dark circle of National Socialism in a highly official and public way.
It is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas that suffer from this policy.
The refugees will also have to note that the "promised land" which they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to produce decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winterfesten
Konrad has everything to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad in control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen", he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday had also taken place without great vortex, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master's achievement".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodation needs to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 countries are to provide 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," Konrad said.
He's already had talks with the country's chiefs.
These would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Helps like us".
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be possible for quartifiers to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
Note standards should apply for a limited period of time.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, and he is motivated by his experience.
I am an older master, who is not said to be in the face without further ado.
His most important weapon is conviction.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs as they explained themselves.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
The search for his own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But apparently there are problems with the authorization.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tip Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz plans.
This was not necessary at the moment, because the people concerned could currently be housed without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, additional sites should be assessed for their suitability.
The head of town is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Do not lock borders"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of state Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further action on the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the first time.
However, the applicants for protection would be taken to Germany by regular trains.
Of the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the issue of refugees.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the German approach.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line has officially been completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, while the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and then acquiring which ones.
From the beginning S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, each one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining space in the building is already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are at the centre of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to lay a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone the project briefly in the dove market archive: after all, she has now grown in the form of another business space.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop where they sell, among other things, bags, bags, shoes and robes of different manufacturers, now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks have been converted.
"But I've been thinking about opening a store for a long time," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who even has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle by her mother.
I'm most fit when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women put up with a beautiful handbag when they see it, the specialist can't answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the creators.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself hostile to foreigners, concerns journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President's Office strongly condemns the election campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the billionaire's grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-habitant location are over -30 corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The caller Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed either in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sparrows, among which in addition to Trump is also the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the king of hearts he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the family's performance, it also tends to think that Trump is "a bit big-mouthed," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has around, "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the creators, she says.
So Trump comes from the host's village.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold grave room in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first property purchase in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homes in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not take Trump because he once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folkology, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like the one who's pattering, it's not that nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired winegrower sees the American more distant, "he's always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," the 72-year-old says.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions like some of the Kallstadters that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something on the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn't go to the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who had been telling at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will mature without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12 000 cinematographers, even in the USA, aroused interest.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first mountaineering village.
From the hands of the Vice-President of the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for the award of the award.
A mountaineering village may have a maximum population of 2,500.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson yesterday to Canberra to report after the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal Capital when Malcolm Turnbull brought Tony Abbott's fall.
The rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Army, was part of a one-week series of international television shows in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared with today 339,000.
Today a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Up to September, Sunrise is an average of 349,000 spectators at today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these mornings more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and struck easily The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, gave an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped at 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot-seat averaged 620,000.
The decline in the second evening quotas of The Chase Australia will vote with confidence that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that couldn't overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Confidentiality revealed? ...
Lana Jeavoir-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who ended up at Sam Wood in The Bachelor's office, was kept in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will surely give up whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavoir-Fellows on the day before we got out of three two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until Thursday’s finale
All three women in a lyrical way have relied on why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they want to be their partner.
However, when the question is asked "If not you, who should receive Wood's last Rose?", their answers to the player who won the heart of the Bachelor's degree could become worse.
Jeavoir-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the entire course of the show," said Jeavoir-Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly on him," she said.
And when she was asked to choose whom Wood would choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a bang as much as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion did at his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian success had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the schnitzer with his original debut then in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with armed force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company confiscated Yukos and prevented his democratic efforts.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW-Herbstklausur in Großwallstadt, party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfaktion der Freie Elector meets until Friday in the subfranische Gemeinschaft.
In fact, quite a different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will superimpose the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as existed during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards from the federal states across the country."
"Bayern is moving away, others are not."
"We must become more capable of action."
But the country policy in Greater Wallstadt should not be put under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Medium Plus" at 47 secondary schools, in which an extension of the upper secondary school from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes again nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all secondary schools who want to.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shot rubber on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a crowd that protested against the proposed new constitution, one official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Senior District Officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before returning to rubber shots.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal about the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators this week voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
Planned is a mixture of trade, business and housing - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approximately 4000 square meters of land in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, business and housing.
You wait for corresponding offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor comes into question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it tear off.
Project Hive: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented plans for the project for the first time in public.
Some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure shelter
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, grumpled, debated and signed.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, who accused the investor and the administration of mystery creamery, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We don't yet have an answer to all the questions," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
The images and new details of the hotel were highlighted by a lot of reactions among sea-bud owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenowner and member of the Board of Directors at Pro Hive, who is representing investors, complains: "This is going to be a giant wreath that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like a number of other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make it count", says Schulz
What is happening on the very one hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must first have had a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the building plans are also variable.
Young twins at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with young people at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana has brought about twins yesterday.
Double births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said of the zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins has not yet been established, as Mother Diana keeps them close to her body.
First the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclones south of Cape Verden islands
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted a broad low pressure system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to create a tropical hurricane in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations because they are tearing away from the war and fleeing impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of making the announcement to a manager, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
Donations go to four non-profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugerelief are doubled to $11 million.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, using various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obesely obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tubing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatment at approximately 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% fully and partially solved diabetes.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the blood pressure controls, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the "surgical" group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient’ s blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass chirurgy group had lost more weight compared to the gas trekoma group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1 %), and rather recorded a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7 %).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing obesity compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit in survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his or her BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly considered in Belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and unimaginable at school, meets the mouth of her youth after years, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "We are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, as it plays in the village of Langweiler and the surrounding localities.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument in her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the given circumstances.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised their efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the September 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the US violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxin control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of income from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mute test in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberries, grapes and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
A few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning, especially in small children.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call centre at Kansas University Hospital, Sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let any swallow whisky stand around, but people leave this hand disinfectant in the reach of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from school after strawberries scented hand disinfectant, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold that an adult considers to be drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah rang her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfection and banished her from her room.
The police considered the forgotten plan to be "swallowing" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in a car accident on the crossing between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-road towards the circular traffic industry area and realized too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the circular traffic.
He then hit the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta ahead.
The accident vehicles were damaged by material damage of about 10 000 euros, the police reported.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be dragged off.
Rumours: No Disharmonies at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful with January-Neuve obligations that could destroy the unity of the cadre
Dons increase lead via Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony
There are rumours about disharmonies at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control because they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalty with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to keep going.
We really need to really support Celtic because that makes the players better.
To stand together now is so important.
Warburton Careful with January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was paying attention to some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is careful about signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players coming in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instruction
Swansea Storm Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expired.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Fatherson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the defenseman was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains what he said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The impeccable Hibee was corrected after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-heart players Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It's safe to say that I don't go back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the guys back on track," said Donnelly.
McInne's happy to win "unfavorable" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a five-point advantage ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in poker games or leagues that haven't won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent higher than that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the course
As security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were the officials able to take the disruptors into custody.
A breath alcohol test was performed in a 16-year-old 0.89 per thousand.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 percent and initially remained in custody.
Why I will be a witness of an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is being put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a audience gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed through the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January via his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications than places are often available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
He who is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of abandoning my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public relations work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treee would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you're getting from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man convinced after wet police chase to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to "convince him gently to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a home-breaker incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Scardel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactics - "A good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the grave to avoid an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to design a humorous Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cobalt-Tupfer test at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage claims and did not want it "looking like grapes hanging too high."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they're starting to think I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stable.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
You obviously believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly hold their noses because they failed in trying to hold me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's gonna be personal?
Does the RVL behave cowardly and possibly make people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will let them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "laughing", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees wrongly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
On weekends, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia, the police from Shepparton, met.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and the lack of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy returns against rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has referred to criticism of his players' gratitude as "Agenda Setting" by two NRL's Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster's Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely disguised remark to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's gratitude and said that they were only focused on their "contact" when they came to the credit.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This always shows up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Dangles a real focus, and this has given us the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's strange how this always occurs at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-term" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with ours on Friday evening and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he'd take care of it a little bit.
But now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build up more trust because they say these things, because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points that are exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet with them in one phase.
This weekend, the Storm team won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the prefinal at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 drug deposit
A man who may be threatened with a life-long punishment because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a security deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong penalty for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire quantity and that the coffee shop could have been harmless for a reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and adheres to a lockout of 18:00-06:00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus breaks apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening in the event of a collision with three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had been braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house was completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 hours.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, logged in to an online messaging service from which he received a series of rude pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms for searching for rude images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it, because it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and then he "proclaimed to be a police officer to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a addiction that he was addicted to frighten people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out by him on the computer, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the rude pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to having taken rude pictures of children on June 14, last year, to having violated the requirements on January 25 of this year and not appeared before court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense Officer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a security deposit in this case, but was detained for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the sentence.
Schleuser deviate on small border crossings to Germany from
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many locks left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
More than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn along the Inn border.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and traffic jams.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to register.
According to Federal Police reports, there were still a lot more refugees at the Munich Central Station than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8:00 p.m., one speaker said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Expeditions of Tropensturm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storm buoys in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart is currently streaming warm sea air into the country.
The strong depth is the ejector of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days had been drawn across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands.
Slight storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, the Black Forest, the Schwäbian Alb and the Constance Circle can also be expected with gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour until Thursday morning.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The masses do it: Every two years the carmakers show their innovations at the IAA.
Especially in 2015 there is movement in the compact cars, which currently sell very well.
At present, cars from the compact class are particularly in demand: According to the Motor Vehicle Federation (KBA), approximately 28.1 per cent of new registrations came from this segment alone in August.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel sees a start below the largest competitor in VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra initially only as a five-doorer.
The second variant will follow the combi in spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and an emphasized sports GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
Baleno's sales start in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger mainly put their hand on the front panel: here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants, such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, will join at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel Judicial Service, who was housed for months in a cell that was too small.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were locked up for a few days in the rooms to be closed (see: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Judicial Institute between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now again on the loose had been moved to a larger cell.
His action for arrest on the grounds of the unworthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Courts lifted the judgement of the Berlin Chamber Court and re-examined the case.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of the compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days' imprisonment for compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "fearing the legal protection of the personality".
The Chamber Court must now clear the amount of the compensation.
In the past, the Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only admitted damage to a prisoner because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, it is also inhuman to have multiple occupancys of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff was housed in a cell of the same type as in Karlsruhe for between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even beatings should have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of young people, 19 are supposed to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
According to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, some 800 000 asylum seekers will be coming to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this and we can do it".
As for Germany, the following overview is given.
Different forecasts indicate that between 350,000 (evaluation by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (evaluation by the Pestel Institute) dwellings will be used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built to date (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: every year 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price commitment, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
The Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding from 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80 000 social housing units per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in support.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for housing investments.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticises.
However, the question of whether they find work in Germany is crucial for the integration of refugees.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the ban on the employment of refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the obligation to stay, which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, for the most part, due to the lack of skilled workers, the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market has been maintained.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
To date, there has not been a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt, the Königsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children into the Kitas, estimated between 10 and 15 percent: "It is very important for the born parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes manuals in different languages.
If the demand for female educators increased sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beat Stammers from the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or people who have suffered from studying - the only exception was until now Berlin, but insider Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Study-oriented refugees could be facilitated access to higher education.
Refugees with a residence permit or patience no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Benefit Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not get a babois because they do not fall within the circle of the babois.
Traged refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span will be shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, require Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new state religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and to allow it certain means of control.
This also includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany, destroyed", he said on Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will in future be much more than today a topic of society as a whole.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has, for a short decade, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrants' organisations and stakeholders of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements like the German Anti-racism Convention will require in the coming years must become reality if the country is to remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, according to medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money had to be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to be handed over to all arrivals immediately upon registration.
These benefits could later be paid to the Länder.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Benefit Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create language barriers.
To date, Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are less aware of their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, it requires interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would also have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
With the partially other forms of illness, German doctors would be aware of their training, according to Montgomery.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees even being doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and carry out further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates from the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those with post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fear and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, most skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidschaft" the Circus Probst uses the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to attract every age group to the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal treatments and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you into the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Leidship" - under this motto is the current manegen production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important for us to get people out of their daily waste and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says 27-year-old Junior Director.
"Manegen cocktail with world city flair", Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm into their ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent movies it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salts, Circus Probst's acrobatics also fascinates with a feeling of touch and joint.
Balance the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
The snakes fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misrepresentation in the position of circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, will be read out from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to enter the manege.
So the highest commandment: to care for the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their zebra Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebrastat.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there might be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17th to 20th at 5pm and 8pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, for the show at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is making false speeches in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also disturbed by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with bumps.
Last month, they had beaten him up and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones warning them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of the Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party was "careful" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected job loss leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenues and "will be focused on providing unreachable, integrated technology solutions for companies so far", explains the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to deal with the rejection of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates have to be behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation takes place according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played 157 league games in just 65 of Arsenals in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight games since 2007/08, most of which have to record days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger starts a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, Zagreb's Maximummir Stadium is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal drew the lesson from last season with the Champions League chapter against Monaco and remains driven away from the far hope of leading the club with his management to his first European Cup trio.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
Arsenal's never worked.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate now than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the man's year to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study with more than 2,000 high-school students with depressed symptoms found that if the patient had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "sound mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you must first have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one phone-care employee explained to me: "My listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends.
The old phrase "I'm going to do it" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes in my mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
So much my objective external status on the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if on this weekend you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned backdrop for the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends with you to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only strive for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game by Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and relax to look back, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't achieved another one or two goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which in the weekend was able to hold a 2-2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing tower was called the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before he nicely closed Johan Wiland to the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, entered the field at Anpiff with nine national players and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep down in the middle field.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far by Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up himself, with some miscarriages and bad closures, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts sat alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had deployed him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan reached his sixth seasonal goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was given a goal in the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Take care of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, which is based in Switzerland, which is affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt clearance plan.
Glencore, registered in London, stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is exerting demand and devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to clear about one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on September 25, and answers President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The President of the United States and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyber spying by China and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 PS sports cars borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
Then the evil awakening came on the rainy highway.
At a company in the district of Gotha, you can meet the dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the province of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was then gone.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the loop on a wet road and drove to the main course.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The material damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously just a few years before Spain's commitment to Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two times Club world champions, two times European champions, one time World champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years of age and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already in front of the EM 2008 before his departure from Barcelona.
"I was told Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we didn't have anything," he says.
And that also registered FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
The change didn't come about.
And the decisive man for this work today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned the reds off (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the Royal Triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shockedly, with insulted unbelief, and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor from The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white keeper.
The producer of Dear White People stood up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon replied that their direction "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO KNOW that it hurts".
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white policeman, the Black Lives Matter movement had a nationwide impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to order discriminatory practices against colored arrest.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a competitor who had been able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
Two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals during the final season.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-hitted victory, still under shock at winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
All of a sudden, as I can't even imagine, as this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first one to finish the course at all, does not get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will be the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's in any kind of trouble about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shootings will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best baseball teams, and today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) broke up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go into the game in a very focused way.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was good at rocking the wood," Ausmus said.
He looked good during (shit training), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the back of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double at the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunch, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed over the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designed rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who escaped a two-run from the right-hand man Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double game this season
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, the wall made an RBI double against the closing of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
The right-hander, however, kicked Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a non-movable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than one month because of a back injury.
"Obviously not the beginning I wished for," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff basster in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, managed to make another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose reached 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit him very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Relieve Right-Hand A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez quit because of an injury to the throwers.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a breakup in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people arriving there are to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
It accounted for 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay temporarily there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government bureau responsible for the initial admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, regards military action with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I think the decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He suggested that the European states should look together.
Four years ago, one had been glad that the cup passed by a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is landing in front of our front door," he said in the Deutschlandfunk.
The former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
On Tuesday evening, Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner announced in the Austrian TV station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far been unable to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU Ministers of the Interior want to take a new start for the compulsory distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee background in Germany, the Federal Government wants to strengthen its support for the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection would also be able to do so.
But who has no perspective can also not stay in Germany.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent dragpers from searching for exit routes through Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey thousands of more migrants were on the way to the Greek border, according to eye-witness reports.
Cassini space probe finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean waps.
This is concluded by researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon is easily twilighted on its orbit around the ring planet.
Although this doom movement is small, it is too big for a solid heavenly body, it is said in a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
"Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of Saturnmond in 2006 and the water vapour and ice particles feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed back then.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up Offensivteur Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had resulted in an injury to the adductor at the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" newspaper with regard to the possible commitment of a non-union professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was recently active in Belgium and was previously already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatians currently have "the opportunity to prove their ability".
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
The Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training already on Thursday.
Okotie had been injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on his head.
However, contrary to his initial fears, he remained without a serious wound.
No diet fruit - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often advised rather by them.
Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy anyway: B-vitamins as well as vitamins E and C are included in them. Above all, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It relieves the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. UPS package service restores up to 95,000 helpers to the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Above all, drivers are sought.
Last year UPS had already increased its staff by 95,000 for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had led to harsh criticism of parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
The next night, as Meteo Switzerland reported on Tuesday, breaks into the valleys on the north-north side of the Föhn.
On Wednesday and the night of Thursday, the Föhn blows partly with storm strength through the Föhntäler.
After Föhnend on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rainfall, gusts and a fall in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a Communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Islands in a strong south-west flow.
On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys in the night.
As a result, the Föhn blows in the Föhn valleys from 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in the Urnerland partly with more than 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can move to the neighbouring middle country in some ways, and even hurricanes of more than 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hairdryer provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius, the humidity on the southern slope of the Alps begins to extinguish.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, in the next 48 hours, south of the Alps will have to be expected with some rain of over 100 litres per square metre, after heavy rains have already fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn goes out the air, as a cold front rolls with strong, partly weathery rain from West to East via Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go back clearly.
The following days are presented in the north with a autumn of 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunny and warmer with a weekend of up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a so far unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German Reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes could often live as a minority only in the hidden faith.
The square is symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustine monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At the time, he felt the city to be a lost scapegoat.
According to historians, his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thesis against the withdrawal trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and fantastic shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is by no means equivalent to "delightful" pictures.
On the contrary, it can seem quite gloomy to the subject concerned.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Buche of All Books".
These are cycles that devote themselves to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments, or fatherhood.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, dealt with the respective scriptures.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and so into today, in current contexts "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old twice allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"Then the education happened with the tube stick," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've been trying to work this out in order to be able to deal with the Lord's Father again."
His second concern was to restore art to greater importance in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolics are being pushed away.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into the pictures", to let them work on themselves, to discover and to feel the power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" being a lover of Otmar-Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take full care of the Bible, but rather chose the subjects that are important to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text only explains".
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to " deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train closes
Plans were made, space was found, company commissioned, grounding modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already closed.
Failures in politics and administration led to despair, especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the train.
So the hills moved off, looking for new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
The approval will be received in October and the first councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock has now been able to inform the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without "a further break of remembrance".
DFB intensifys engagement for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 and the Bundesliga is a clear sign on the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and assures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be of interest to everyone to get to grips with this topic," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be at the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role here," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
However, the key points must be policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," explained Niersbach on the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they will bear the imprint "We Help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can," said Leverkusen Sport Manager Rudi Völler of the "image" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "naturality".
"The refugee drama is everyone's business, no one's allowed to miss."
"We football federalists can, no, we have to take advantage of our radiance, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The National Women's Team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale to the EM Qualification Game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large community of German football".
That all 36 licensing companies in their locations had started their own projects was great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB election and the Federal Government, will each provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called the entire sum for 2015", reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
According to several reports, the CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July.
In the event of the accident on the stairs of his brother's home in the United States, after midnight, he had fallen on a glass of water, which he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he was powerless, then dragged himself out on the street - he told us that last week," quotes "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutscher Zeitung" (Thursday Edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually hangs between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except fighting ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
At the night race in Singapore, therefore, he did not come into question as a reserve driver for the two main pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League finally broke up.
The national player will also be missing from the table leader of the football league in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't use him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be again on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topspiel against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect to return from him to training on Friday".
Due to the high load of his pros, Tuchel will not only change his stem organ on the reus position.
He announced a change of position at the gate guard.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europe-League games in the future.
He will probably also contest the second party.
The researchy statement by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl considers it comprehensible: "This is not so wrong for Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title off."
Robot cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be technological pioneers according to the will of the Federal Government in changing the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IAA Automesse.
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss this issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test track on motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver is "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government intends to "check and, where necessary, adapt the legal framework to new developments".
For example, Germany intends to make international efforts to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government is also committed to an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected by 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German location is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said Sören Bartol, SPD transport politician.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-propelled cars still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra testing organisation presented on Wednesday at the AA concludes that only 8 percent of Germans believe autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, the motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a survey of Bitkom's digital network, only seven percent would agree to hand over control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, there could be 15 per cent of the traffic in running traffic, in the dam 45 per cent.
Well, every fourth person would not leave control of the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team- and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike only in detail during the title battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsor appointment in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German master is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favorite," declared Single European Champion Dimitriy Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we became European champions."
"We should be oriented towards that," the world rankings said.
The English national football player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has committed a serious injury to his right leg.
During the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defenseman was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis of the 20-year-old fellow player of Bastian Schweinsteiger pointed to a break in the rails.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax-figure grusel cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: window dolls, which thanks to video projections look frighteningly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It was bleached before, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the footpath) which can be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion creator has changed his attitude to a view of his person, which at first rejects him.
Actually, he had been against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal, Canada, and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's work, which is hardly yet to be seen, which has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed total work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to refresh the dolls, for example, a stylist was engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been packed to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are cleverer than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, strikingly fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had put on his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later on, I bought them, of course.
He couldn't pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
Earlier, the long embroidery machines went into and around plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed into ceilings and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashionspitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early days of the Plauen lace, fashion played a greater role, was then pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which is based on past style periods, is a growing potential for assignments.
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already make half of all orders with us.
Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spit and Embroidery Industry Association together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, some 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
There are almost no private specialist shops or wholesalers.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, the bulk goods are produced in Asia much cheaper and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger External Office of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
To counter competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and those companies that have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace.
In some places, the machine embroiders small balls.
The Plauener goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krouße was inspired by this: "Before I could not begin with a traditional Plauener peak".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of Plauen's top - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", this is not about a new film, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already stuck: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges the world to open up the economy to the wider world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a group was commissioned to steer the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on regulation of market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), inclusion of private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up State-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a post-meeting statement.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus provide consumers with a much higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper on it, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and adverse effects of missed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish are to be raised from one to two milligrams mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fishes were already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 per cent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After doubling the limit, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligram to 0.1 milligram of mercury per kilogram.
However, foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller peacefish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion manoeuvre that only helps the economy," said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system in particular.
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment stated on its homepage that "a health hazard to the general population" could not be expected in view of the applicable maximum values.
Mercury is the main source of carbon in the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power stations are issuing more than six tonnes of mercury a year to Annalena Baerbock, a member of the Green Parliament, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, e.g. in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "long-term and wide-ranging", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
