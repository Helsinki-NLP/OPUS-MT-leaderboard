A Republican Strategy to Counter the Reelection of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This has increased since the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the 2011 only year.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with judicial records.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities were eager to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo identification cards.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the Health Insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identification.
However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required identity card with photo.
A lot more.
Students who vote more for Democrats are not allowed to use their photo ID card issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to vote the cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the voting in the country.
However, it appears that two of the three Spanish voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate for new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the advance voters were Afro-Americans, while they represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanians.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who formed 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democrats and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the participatory nature of the laws that have been voted on and see it as a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant implications for the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes produce incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men even more reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for advice from two specialists.
In U.S. studies there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European study, found a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years or 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is important to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer, by offering him the options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
More and more criteria are being determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend that the test be carried out.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one was smoking, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a lot of time for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraged donation: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," is added.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Carcutries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or saling may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"This can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not yet conclusive.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The boson of Higgs decorated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created an all-embracing, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is Higgs.
We know without a shadow of doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it resembles the boson of Higgs much predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data dedicated to this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but data still lacks to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume it's Higgs, because chances of cheating seem slim, and let's see what it's about.
There is, at the bottom of the world, a law that is indisputable, that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantical state" - this "state" consisting largely of some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner we find good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And the other is the bosses, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, from the Berkeley Laboratoires: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all the exotic beasts that we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "displaces" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock launched into a pond.
From this "displacement" comes an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, unlike another field, the Higgs field, which must be "displaced" so that this boson appears.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond where only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-km radius ring! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not have one.
Now, what can "bring" all these researches, ask Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize any differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
In fact, there are many of them who want to be found, because the least difference could be to open a door on a "physical new" and slaughter some of the Model holes.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, proposing no explanation for gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (ups!).
But there have been no such deviations in CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World's daily life is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no research.
Here you are: at the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratoires did not suspect the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They had scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already said fire to physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then the applications can also come from the entire instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during its optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as a "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the Nobel of Physics 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this essential area.
The Devoir tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was raging him had left him with a two-year break.
"They had given me five years to live, I have been seven years," he said, half-figue mid-raise, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
Attacked in front of an appetizing lunch, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even comes to smile, speaks to strangers who care about him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal me from diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our lives, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing to the stage of the child, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place in the heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the " team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "aware and stifled " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she is still expecting a final visit from her son from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provided body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether in physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death, it is accepted to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the loved ones as much as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At home Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not look like each other.
Alongside an elderly 93-year-old man who tastes at his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-capped in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his/her life, whether at home, in hospital or in nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Corporation, are more or less specialized in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes fear to many specialist physicians in palliative care for the adoption of a law to control euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed of summities of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking for death only because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are sticking to their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helena Richard's life expectancy was already minimal when she abandoned testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Greater Montreal Home Care Corporation, patients would be reprimanded for pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means that the patient falls asleep until the time of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
One can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unmet patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to have me out," it means "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us day after day what they know about a great "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A " industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has been getting worse since we took the big money," said Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec City and former Montreal chief of police.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the malfeasances related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had agreed only to step back.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, party occult financing and civil servants' corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he pointed out that the only Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some refer their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "show the strata behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More than the police from the "Marteau Scaude" who, since 2009, would have led the "Breakout Cartel" in Montreal to put the pedal softly on the inflates of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected to have repeatedly picked up bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the road to Montreal and of entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made the impression by explaining to the committee the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal to an intermediary related to the mafia who returned money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito sank at all winds giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fund-raising for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts with which he inflated the costs
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked round.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, has done a good job before the committee: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and wine pots totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts that he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have confessed to getting fattened by inflating from 30% to 40% the bills, with false extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget fueling his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, diving Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to shoot the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, from 2010 she rose against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a wire that allows to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the guilty".
The process, she says, is "bad but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a clean-up unit in Montreal and a day before, so that we don't see any suspicious practices coming back.
Just like we do the housekeeping.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "public servants stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elves in the stratagem" when they did not dip in the pot!
He estimated 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, and ironically said, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to 100 dollars to the parties, but this will not change the data, according to him: "Until we strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot go down; go to the bottom of things, courageously, will allow the house to be rebuilt on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story marries the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr.Duchesneau invites those who don't want to look in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these things force me to lift my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the pre-training centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by steps.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face up and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He was supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who was in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and won a lot of titles with busy clubs.
He sided with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I went out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What look do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the League of Champions: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, everything can happen.
But we will have our word in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget...
In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register over time.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart to wear this title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We ended up with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting too much for PSG?
It's normal that we wait a lot of us in view of what's been invested and the players we have.
We'll accept it completely.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's sure it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
The League of Champions has been shown to be able to respond.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the 8th final since two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In the face of the money invested, you were imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and France's championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not very well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally taken it.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploitation of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better we say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and has a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
He showed wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
In the band, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This pushes others to lift their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone to move forward.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with France's team?
It's like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from picking up playing time.
I saw things over there, and I came out stronger.
Today, I can make good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What look do you have on Didier Deschamps' first months at the head of the Bleus?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its objective by qualifying for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Bleus in Brazil.
Is the good one (1-1) torn up on October 16th a founding game in Spain?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary, current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pair-to-couple files.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around $110 (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency with the most success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits" used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of the account book, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two electronic addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is a matter of solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and its winner, such as temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hack phase, that is to turn a large file into a shorter and uniquer digital print.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hook" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular impression (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different marks.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regular, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge is also addressed at every increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services to Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen from deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, giant soldiers were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just give them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users have.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to get involved, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as the Soviets' time.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, and Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be the case when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hill planted with amandiers thanks to French credits, was carried out in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoureds joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban dealership on Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen, grasping government land to sell them to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, who have benefited from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They were disappointed; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American broads: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are friends with mobile phones; television, and Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and already before.
No industry has been set in motion, no dam is in operation, no significant irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.
It only added to the feeling that the Westerns were there only to get rid of it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, department of French at university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "win the hearts and minds" and to carry out the task impossible to co-ordinate aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and done by a small French NGO, to numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is full of local labour, has helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in arable areas.
What will be remembered after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would help improve local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish, small, well-controlled civil aid should be maintained in their favour, which directly affects them.
A Constitution for Force in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its way.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two more months to finish his work.
In the next two years, Egypt will be building on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For its opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "trate his word" and "paste the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a way of ending it as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy when the challenge is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of an early vote is due to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text, or I reserve the full powers", these supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, by a large majority of Islamists, voted the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door, believing that they could not submit their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, 11 people, replacement members, were added in the hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Commentators also enjoyed the fact that only one of the differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the console of the constituent was poorly settled.
The text, which was still in the process of being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
In the end, article 2 remains the same as in the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the primary source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the "establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have enabled a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answered the Liberals, who only saw a communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include section 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with the legislation.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we can see the first aspects of theocracy".
The fears of the Liberals are also drawn by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not oulamas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, ed.].
And the question could arise in the future as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of its extensive powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civilian trials in military courts will be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
Furthermore, no more articles echo the protection of women, points out Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of salmon await the Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Facty has taken five main reasons for going to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Be sure to be sure: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal funds" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he set the storm down, or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
Believers travel through the Street of Sufferance or the Cross Road (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (prestory), where the trial took place, then leads from the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, towards the place of Crucifixion, then towards that of the Peter of the Onction and the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the Cross monastery was erected at the place where the tree was raised to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave there small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are found on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to the top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes make a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have lived once on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really mattered.
First of all: the Israel Museum near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very old manuscripts of Qumrân, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Museum of Art of Tel Aviv.
It mainly exposes the paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of molds of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Private Rally Museum where you can admire Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter a total darkness.
The stars are scintillating.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21°C while the temperature of the air can reach 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim all year round.
In fact, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azure water contains salmon and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are surreal beauty.
We come here to perform a treatment with salt water, lemon, curative mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Persia saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he himself lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young brides coming to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk into the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist note
If you go to Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and high parts of the city.
This is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes during 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only cashher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made from both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of lamb and beef-based dishes, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, as well as hops, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, molded chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs walking through the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats that walk through the high air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These ferrets love the past places and don't refuse to let them go.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
Number language
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists travelled to Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are polemic about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will need to be validated, as will knowledge of the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
It will be necessary to validate his language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Neither are persons who have obtained certificates or degrees of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 affected by this Act.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Migrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, respond to the representatives of the Migration Service, which will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, Director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Zebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a overcrowded house where he and dozens of his likes will torment for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"With them, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they do not touch the anticipated salary," confirms the Head of Migration Services for the work of Tajikistan's Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't fight me, sir!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia trust that they not only know the language of the country they wish to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their misery: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education is feasible.
Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without telling them to dress properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they arrive at adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel reduced and depressed."
Human rights defenders note, however, an important aspect of the Language Act.
Examinations will only be for migrants with legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or work in the future.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
Welcome or defend to enter
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then we can get a false record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, tea," said Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajikistan national.
"Be quick, don't laze and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers for migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
falsified papers come from an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper sticks".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time examination to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russia will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to strengthen the law against those carrying civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: it is about the shootings during the marriages or the killings organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a weapon-carrying licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "locking the gap".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, the BBC lawyer and crime specialist.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, we can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plant to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five," says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "the military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasus," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapon from the black market is the weapon-wrapped one by criminals to the law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols leave the military warehouses for sale.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been set in motion to conceal the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private arms factories that don't compete on the international market and drain weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons in the black market were found there "in the absence of workers whose work is linked to weapons," the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from "clandestine boxes".
A salesman and a consultant from an armory who asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these illegal search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, in his opinion, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a teaching unit, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by grilling the goods.
"He transports it to town and sells it for 900 € by unit with two chargers," he says.
"It's true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, they are buying control from the illegal arms merchants," adds the seller.
"As in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are usually through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to the Begovaya station where someone came to take me to a "coin" to shop.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salesmen in the markets, but there is also a need to come, for example, by saying "On the part of such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy an American pair of fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them.
The small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former member Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The diagrams, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military remembers.
There is no secret to the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I'm not just buying, we go with the salesman in the woods and we install a target.
"I'm being shot and when I'm convinced that the weapon is working well, we're starting to negotiate," the expert describes.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any documents and no one to meet.
"Just have a certain amount of money," we write in advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a combat machine".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", the user asks "Ivan" (preserved spelling).

I have heard about these types of schemes: in general, the site is recorded outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the association "Right to a gun.
Victor Baranets states that by applying on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to January-October 2011, the overall number of such crimes decreased by 7% in Russia and was 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Almost a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages of the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave will increase or resuspend rapidly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the modest increase in wages for basic workers at Walmart and in fast-food chains, the organisers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Vendredi", at a time when a rain of balances taking hold of millions of inhabitants struck America and sometimes triggering scoundrels.
On that day, some employees of Walmart company, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their position to organise strike pickets with the trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of small and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting guns through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many underpaid employees at Walmart do their races only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of lifting trolleys or portable scanners.
Participants in the events of the "Black Vendredi" asked for an increase in wages, they complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 per hour, it is an amount that he cannot afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages to the consumer's shoulders, each race in the store would bring them back to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in one year than now.
The supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Black Vendredi" continued in the stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items over this period.
His caisses made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Selling".
The spokesman for Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-hand Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "operation of com' among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were also about the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, that's why they're not located there) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of dollars and after they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the work you've done honestly!
Jumane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases over time, but on average, its basic employees reach New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches anything but them in this city.
For me, it's impossible to live with this money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers were working at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income there or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast food be paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters through bullying or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking advantage of the quick restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat policies, including that of Jumane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and pay you the work you did honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio's position who said that "we all need to support employees in the fast-restoration process so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast-restoration sector in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people took part, not all of them were fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York City.
For the time being, it is difficult to say whether this mass movement spark will make children.
"At the moment, one can only say that one can't fool the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the increased reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained the same for the moment with pixels on flat screen and sometimes with the touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is selling today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What's the future for us too?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things are happening on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The capture of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out in our own, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She is appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
One cannot say that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet gestures, restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded bone and muscle movements.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's what I'm saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we will soon have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These can be for example laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames in the second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given sensors a regular delay in processing between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or increase it by increasing the volume of calculations required.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the camera curve and see how this could help to define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the everyday use of the technologies of increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone lifting hands is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transit" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to a smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's just imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents point their finger: there is no touch sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be a very good addition to the touch sensations.
For the time being, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It records perfectly the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below that will have to be done for a long time: the way to convince someone physically in a very small space that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of running carpets (to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, the brain can only be deformed on average, there are still many years of work left.
This makes the work on virtual reality so interesting to the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Le avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the cities that are in advance, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, dressed in red that you can cross by the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the festivals and trendy varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their location of exhibition.
He is one of the petersbourgeois essentially social and philosophical tales, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersbourgeois vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbaria and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role due to his existence, philosophy and image as a bohemian.
Kirill, why are you running the city all in red and not in yellow or blue turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specialising in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, all that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to begin the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of the old informal painters was gone and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I started to join friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was the home of a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in molding jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the band started to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was quite a host of shows before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his basic training and education was at home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the consequences of the artistic clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organised in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Peint of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognisable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very topicality and acuteness.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragedy falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him his hand, but we have to spit him out.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the Barbaria organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful as well?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, lyous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, the people were divided into flocks, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people that we've thrown out to see him, it's the sex and social side that's working.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and ultimately it is less management, money, everything will go down.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not ruin the life.
When I was young, I was painting paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a path for them.
At present, it is the "reign of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is Saint Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for that.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with terrariums on board go looking for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in apesantness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
In fact, there are two real planets that we can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomy Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on reproductive issues in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then insects, small reproductive drosophile flies, were put on orbit.
In 1979, calyx eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in apesant form.
At the exit we get a very normal chick.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is linked to the fact that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Academy of Russian Sciences (IMBP).
When no support was found, the chicks were acting disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We struck their eyes twice, and then we abandoned them, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature sheet" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a bad case.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is, in principle, capable of doing so.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after theft.
"No one answered this question," says Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaute Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy descendance after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train themselves to extra-vehicular exits.
Water imitates the apestizer.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The little amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves for about 9 months in the lymphoid fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water.
It's logical in principle, because from birth to first bath, it only takes two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just born the apesant is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In apest, the muscles of the belly, the basin rapidly atrophys, and the baby's push capacity is lost.
Okay, let's ignore that by relying on delivery simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special training suit.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled, completely disadapted child," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time it will become reality, when the Terrians will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their natives born into space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Public Finance Control Institution) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Superior Public Finance Control Institution, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the Švarc system by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting the law," says Kala.
You referred to a Czech-German project during which public procurement legislation in both countries was compared at the check-up committee meeting in the House of Representatives.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement and specific national legislation can be managed, as well as a practice itself.
We have gathered all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality", however, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what results from it for you?
A common control of this kind should help precisely to stop us trying to clarify laws, reduce and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds in the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork, that those looking for the faults will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different organization?
As for the institutions, similar to the ISC, the Federal Accounting Court works there, which is organized similarly, it also has a slightly different council, but these two institutions are basically similar.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, however, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure and therefore also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which is in our hands the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the rates of the Lands' accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has meant to you, as an institution, to the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, that its effects are already felt?
As this amendment has come into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do retrospective checks, we have to count with some delay.
Our observations relate only at the moment to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "bad management risk detection" with which we have gone to the screen of nearly 14,000 public procurement - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified, as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures, and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an increase in administrative burden?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was forced by controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the law on markets meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system banned or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent action by an authority responsible for inspecting and requiring compliance with the law.
He can declare: "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen, but most remain feasible.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely operational in some areas with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but in frozen places and also snowy.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 °C and -10 °C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and remains in the plains only a thin snow layer.
The peaks of the Metalllife Mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that due to fog, visibility was reduced in areas.
The fast R6 route and national roads in the region are now easy to operate.
Vigilance remains, however, on some bridges, for example, where the coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still some of their sections of frozen snow remnants and traffic-packed places.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice-cream formation and that traffic-packed snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice-cream formation in the areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be freezing in the vicinity of Lanškrun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class routes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Mountains of Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mountains of Eagles (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knuu and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-packed snow is present on the roads in areas at altitude.
In eastern Bohemia, the weather is now dry, most often clear, with possible cloud changes.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 °C and +1 °C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, causing temperatures to oscillate between -3 °C and -9 °C.
After the last snowfalls and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
Highway D5 can be used almost without difficulties, however, road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 km and 131 km.
Most national roads are dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in Pilsen-South District and in Tachov District.
Departmental and third class routes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the area of the Olomouc region at altitude must now count with a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the pass called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský k the following chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are easy to use.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are snow remains.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer in the "Červenohorské sedlo" pass at ČTK today, the head of road maintenance services in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues from the district of Jeseník also visited during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In Olomouc district the roads are easy to operate, however in Šternberk district the drivers should pay attention in the sections in forest areas with wet-smoothed floors.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, road maintenance services in northern Bohemia reported several difficult areas.
Data from the police show that, in addition to some snow or ice-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústugu is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of glazing, especially around Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowstorm during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main roads there are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming new things, the kind of traps we love falling into.
In our group, The Tap Tap, we are fooled rather and we are told that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive balance of energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will be presenting a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11.10 a.m.
The previous day, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will close practically at the time when the Maya calendar will end on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who got that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys to the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called "End of the cancelled world" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung at the same time by all the performers in the three concerts.
The hymns will also join at some point in the context of a completely unique live programme of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom the Hanák, who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other figures from the Czech show-biz, because we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We are trying to get them involved intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the profits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on in the framework of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the Jedličkův Institute students and offer activities that interest them and entertain them.
The students themselves do not have the means to attend classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Do you think there will be a number of music and interpretation groups on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji the Searchý.
You will find all details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will be playing for the first time in the framework of the spring of Prague; here, too, we will certainly be preparing a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like the first time.
We have five electric wheelchair members whose gears have to travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been going well, more or less always, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we came back recently, everything happened without problems.
With your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just been witnesses in Moscow that in the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very unaccessible to persons with disabilities; there is not yet a common practice of a person moving alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a wheelchair person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association working to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
In what way do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements continue to depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather contrary to the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L the Angelovič says, we have lost some control of the situation (Laughter).
Did success happen only in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It is true that creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's subsidies, we can also afford to have teachers of quality, equipment, and so on.
Were you aiming to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is carefully accepted and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned beings of all, which we must take in mercy.
They are people who can live a full life and grow, provided they have the means of doing so, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole of society.
Is your success not also due to your being a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, L the Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't do it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the day before the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the cancelled world" will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to bring together 25 million CZK of financial resources to equip the Studeo multi-functional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is CZK 400, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the prevention of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of the Agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had initiated close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to outer space started much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners behind and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The said Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, and his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear if the rocket was to be used to drive or brake the drain.
The only information known about this Draisin is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with the professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaf Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents retained that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-electric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects for the use of the rocket technique were carried out by the Interim Advisory Scientific Committee ("Tymczasowy Comitt Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problememe, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and from the autumn onwards, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarakiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the Rakieta Meteorologiczna (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently an improved version was built, RM-1A and, in the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (known as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
The entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee were still to be mentioned two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and in 1978, the Miroslaw Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaute of the programme.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Public Works.
This decision raised a strong debate in public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of increased unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free (without limits) movement of private capital combined with a fierce financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a tension on prices.
In this respect, the following meaning should be added: a producer seeks by importing low-priced goods to resist economic competition by making "priced" the competitor's price, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means, for most entrepreneurs, either to transfer production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social costs of the state necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect misconception of masters to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so public that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, governments place their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the collapse of society.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, especially in the area of wages.
This is due on the one hand to a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and, on the other, to the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been points of public food distribution for the poor for years that cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse in society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live up to poverty wages on the margins of society in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then, a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to be tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital is in favour of the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory intervention.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not direct, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby that is present in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national departments are delegating the development of draft legislation to industry-related law firms.
These bills were then adopted at the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that the democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly faced with the situation described by Appianos in his book "The Roman Empire Crisis in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The State was long in disquiet and the functions were attributed to violence.
The pots of wine, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The understanders and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... "The honest people did not in any way seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... ' We really started to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we had to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in the spirit of Pompeia, but it was Caesar who irreversibly turned democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today, as in the past, there has been a decline without the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries' economic systems.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are witnesses today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Never will come out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's party, acknowledging its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, genocide against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one which mainly benefits from the tensions that have persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, while others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they should have their actions to the throne of someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that gives rise to certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the poor one (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s onwards, they acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the link between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant strengthening their power, increasing their wealth or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to get up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status and began issuing his own money (government, I hear well) during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a trial against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated to 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The objective of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenicalism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their head the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination of Sarajevo de Ferdinand, heir of Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war suddenly ended with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the break-up of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier trigger of the Second World War, the bankers let politicians create a latent situation of conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany dangerous war reparations, thus generating the conditions for the radicalization of the depleted masses (it is only then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which they did) of fifth column to set the fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for mass emigration from Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorism was committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it was difficult to appreciate whether Hitler had broken the chains in which the international bankers had originally kept it; or if everything he had done was planned, however, the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany led to the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel triggered a firehouse that could trigger a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just to see how people are divided roughly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where another wrong is caused by an endless circle of violence and where the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power throughout the world are found?
We must make a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers only propose to people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist, loyal politicians towards international bankers, who do everything to start a war with Iran, which could, because of its accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, which passes 20% of the world's oil (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and leads to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the comments made by David Rockefeller in 1994 now: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new global order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all the newborns are implanted at birth an electronic chip making them a completely controlled one.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a red iron mark on their hands or front, so that they cannot buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that whoever has good sense counts the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number refers to the man and it's six hundred sixty six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamic students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the positive outcome to the US administration, it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempted liberation of the hostages by force.
Sequestrated diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate gave rise to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential elections against Ronald Reagan.
The film Argo, from the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they returned to the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with rocambolesque coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team who came to make marks for the shooting of a film with great science-fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is on the one hand a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a seistrise - such as in the trilogy Ocean's student, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres are successive: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retransscribed into the film, there are no major differences),
Hollywood's lighter passages, irony-treated and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he has become a respected director and his acting game has ceased to generate ironic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film after the dark police officer " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that does not take place in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions at too many places
The director had to content himself with a subject that in fact offered only few palpative scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It goes very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track are drawn enough by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events at too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their characters would have earned a bigger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it allows itself to be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
It leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some way, uncompleted to date, and as an illustration of the exaggeration of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the matter.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is currently considering adopting a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been the reason for our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of this survey for the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have benefited from life insurance tariffs because they represent, objectively, less risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea as incredible as the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a dangerous substance or the chicken cage directive, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term " butter to be tartine" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas must be 14 centimetres tall.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing requests from its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal course".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it only harmonised non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives lead to waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the EU Regulation last year, according to which there must be a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are the first cause of death of children by stifling among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age to blow in fair trumpets.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue to Greece, anyone with an official EU function cannot use the name "Macedoine" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" bringing together liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, spent the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and thus risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant a subsidy to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, do not come from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea makes us disabled.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) expressed himself.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks which it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for the award of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), who were specifically to be used to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "The bizarre regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts of the EU in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the Union's operation and in the field of general development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (not always victorious) gives rise to strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol products, and not beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, there are now cheeses with world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck or Parme ham, Karlovy Vary cookies ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice carpes and Třebo the "Pohořelický a Třebo the "kapr" and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's "Pardubický perník" and the cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Senator, how is the idea of presenting to the presidential elections?
It's not like you're a senator or a president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted over the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lockouts and taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to get a solution to change.
And since I am more than 40 years independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to stand in presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set off for the Castle (N.D.: chair of the presidency).
Do you not turn your backs on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Subsequently, I said that if I were elected a senator, I would introduce myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we walk hard those who try to make change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and mixes freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I am suing journalists or that I have been the adviser to Ji the Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have begun the battle for the Castle with the themes of political and criminal responsibility and retroactive tax returns beyond 20 million [CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained a cause.
The problem is police: when someone comes from the left or from the right with a good project, he is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogmat supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and to implement it.
You think you're a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place themselves on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we should move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I equally impartially agree with bad ideas.
Do you mind when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you will only have slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to retransmit my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors on television.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality identifying abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President by direct suffrage, it was obtained by the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without embassies, that I am an amateur, not an intellectual or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and I'll go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities asking them to come to the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the oil.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and most of the people did so gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct vote of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning on founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have money either for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million worth of my personal property.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
Either by the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of a kid: I always liked James Bond, who was driving by car, was crazy with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're driving in Aston Martin, you've got a 60 million worth of heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I stop?
I've already invested 2 and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are broadly covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I will not stand for election.
So you're going to continue your business to be able to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in a deaf place?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will be in charge of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I was winning and I'm still winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the real adventures are not only about imagination. To convince themselves, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it does very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an computer scientist in a large neighbouring company, said to us, "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is willing to go to one of those ringing libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a town-dortort that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The community of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
For example, the city authorities realized that there was only one way to take a hand on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the architect office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mind-provoking and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual witty and presented himself in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a ricnation on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcertingly and raising their shoulders, Maas, the scavenger, stacked his books of choice in order to make them a pyramid, and finished his talk with activist arguments supported by one: "holy!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or, as we say, Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain fell off the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and houses with a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the Book Mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This small, thorny township, which so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of an audacious lair, whose white facades invite you to think they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you sweep the ground of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverbers unequivocally speak the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at the public benches, the dogs and the little boys and girls playing ball.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely changed the classical spatial configuration and opened the interior reading spaces to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been nicely furnished: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
That is how one day we found in an agricultural company friezes an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, one millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're making time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimetres.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pots figs.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"This is incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in ecology," Trouborst said.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal means.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as sun umbrellas, intercepting a large part of the beams.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Buchenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
In fact, a few weeks ago, during the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure filled the gaps in the library that were not yet fully covered (now it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration."
For example, MVRDV has reached master's discipline, which is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even though it may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore meet on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still taunting to find that role, but they're on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
An external policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other major powers: therefore, Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to attack public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive factor in the strategic thinking of Germany.
Does Germany suffer from its relations with the United States by opting for abstention in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear vote.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences in opinion are not so great that they always appear.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from exhilarating with Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore join a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
That is what they are doing at the moment in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been delicate.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she always have difficulties in taking leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking, for example, at the euro crisis, it is noted that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very diverse neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling that gap, so what remains?
The Germans simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such as the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would gain cause.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitationists need only a few additional letters to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, like Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a cabinet in which the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by acquiring part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities there are multi-storey shopping centres that sell almost only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its clients charge it to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are named who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, you have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market analyst CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to delete suspicious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the critical name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the complainant because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the jungle law that dominates.
Well-known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's conqueror, used a blue and white logo to remind him of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarisms of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
However, the CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year the Office would have passed from a "emergency situation in the course of work to a found normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Cost-effective action
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and that means that China is the tenth consecutive leader in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be true for the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the impersonator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wenzler, President of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munichese objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the following two cases, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is of the utmost importance
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and denounces the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. Archives even had to review the acts of the past 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "great sum of six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what this represents for us," Wenzler said.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spread beyond Europe.
This would be the case if impersonators in this region ensured the operation of the unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company in Germany.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "the vigilance is set".
Pattloch and advised German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law, rather, foreigners should "register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much greater than registration costs.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal tragedy, the company should pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or we'll lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: Foot Taper, Singing, Help
The choir Imbongi repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland’s AIDS welcome their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, you hit your foot: cowboy boots, basketball, ass for ladies and moccasins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they take themselves, envelop and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came from the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Helping to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per year, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means "story storyteller" in zulu or "speech of praises".
No one can speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres on flight from Heidelberg bird, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some of them live in modest straw or earth huts and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphaned, because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, there are smaller-scale reports of the evils that aggravate Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population practically never accepts male circumcision, a measure which, however, ensures a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis saw mainly many children on the street where there was not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who made a personal commitment to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir was founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since dealt almost professionally with the orphans of Escheni's AIDS.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial IST includes syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common IST are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubis lice and gale belong to the parasitic ISTs.
What groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhage often occur in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In adult heterosexuals, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhage and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
There is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections among young people than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
Furthermore, in Germany, human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital abscess, urinary pain, white loss, lower belly pain, and the appearance of buttons and glass.
However, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms on a regular basis and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect them 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or by close body contacts.
The experts therefore recommend that all persons who often change sexual partners should conduct regular reviews.
Most of the quickly detected IST can be cured and late side effects can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the chorists reap through their voices throughout Germany, the means are increasing.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esiteni", says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-sustaining woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, this is what old women in Zullou are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offering them a roof and making sure that they visit school every day of the day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two pulleys. With the help of the U.S. health organization PSI, the association has organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned morals, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.
Culture is different, flesh versus flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, the choirists of Imbongi leave together every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people from the tip of the Black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only creates good mood and joy, but also sometimes tears a tear at some terrible border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Ezicheni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a trip of 8.733 kilometres by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists, which take off from their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, you will also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
Messenger has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
Messenger has reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet being constantly immersed in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
Water probably comes from comets or possibly asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, there is no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Inspected by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the naïve planet Cerès.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where the stars were born, named "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopé, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flashing flash of a star dying.
The beige-shaped circle consists of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the vast Nebula Trifide, at 5,400 light years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, stars amaze also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colour value.
In this infrared photo, the Nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His similarities with an earthly continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo shows a spectacular colour.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigms of astronomy is the creation of Saturn rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and brightest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the colour, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousand light years.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust carriers divide the shining heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the first of a cosmic caram company in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Céphe.
The nebula is 1,400 light years and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
The circle consists of black holes that are 430 million light-years of the Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies named Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our lukewarm path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with bright rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, United States.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is approaching those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe looking for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "research extraterrestrial intelligence") by making a contribution to the calculation power of his machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach an impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows him to admire.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the space telescope Kepler.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
In particular, the telescope will be tasked with finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A country survey, which is still relatively young at the age of 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A country survey, which is still relatively young at the age of 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of a bald romance.
In the turn of the road, the small bus falls along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we find ourselves here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasus ethnic group of the name Talysh, about which we do not know much, is seen, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small plastic city with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region that are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having a child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is  the museum's "Irali Müslümov", a shepherd who was 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have conceived another girl.
Would it have been wrong for a few decades to calculate his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the age of Central Asia.
"Unfortunately elderly people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documentation, except that there was no civil record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is true that the people of the Lerik region often reach a proper age for the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for longevity in the southern part of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh's high-calorie meals, which love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground next to a barracks, of which she beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under a single roof, among them one of the sons of Mirzayeva and one of the daughters, who have long grown up.
Two little children also go to the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long twigs of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the slightest food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda surprises the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who led his country as a dictator, hardly knows limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him later.
In any event, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, which guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" forgotten in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
There are rival demonstrations that reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft sharia-based constitution is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not afraid of words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the whole people, but also for the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened and the secular Muslims.
For all the members of the opposition are confused and desperately disunited are afraid.
They fear theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by excuse, he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people during a night shift of 15 hours are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides for jurisprudence to be based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting scope of legal manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it means thinking about a newly introduced article stating that, in all matters relating to sharia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its shine shines on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the under-control of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to punish the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, if it is to be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morale and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits the insulting or defaming of the Prophet Mahomet or his messengers.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Was it not enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawyer?
There are, therefore, many points to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi is putting to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The Revolution Repented."
The opposition has been mobilized for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," Hamdin Sabbahi launched, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to the Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On its side, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-festivalation not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The women veiled and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, were shocked: "the people demanded the application of the law of God."
"Nettle our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urns of the leadership that the country must take.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this imposed constitutional process, which should have extended until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World on Sunday.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are critical violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who is looking at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway shrimp: is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway benefit from one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty foot clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 o'clock from Oslo.
It is snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-spaked trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Hapard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and get a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," adds Hapard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the cold, the fish was immersed in airtight water bars, then salted in autumn.
Then, in the winter, when the fish was well fermented, it went out and - without a doubt with the senses of alcohol reduced - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although intoxicating, of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not a cause for concern.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country one of them could commit such barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a shrimp plate at hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep its stock market tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and do hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rapper," she adds in a careless laugh.
I'm standing under the snow, and I'm tailing my tail to buy me some food - I've had my dose of shrimp.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I am staying in is one of many places where we serve rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a padlock, surrounded by rocket plates.
We would be in favour of Eurovision.
"What score did you score the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Haverd."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a hard start.
While the President entering Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the many challenges that await him and the expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly poor at present.
In a city where traffic jams are in normal times, a security dam has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sharf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that are due to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is experiencing a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that encases the capital. On its preferred land, the opinions regarding this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
The premises give him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bulged and full of cracks.
Plates with its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and of the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy, in particular, we hope for a genuine change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was eliminated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of opponents who accuse the new president of missing charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called to the rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, where violence against women is particularly serious.
The bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the border of landfill in a disaster area.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr.Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Pena Neto's detractors say that at best, he failed to contain the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this disbanded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version describes a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and cadave rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana disguises the wall, next to a cross containing the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old commer, a troublemaker, a weeping woman.
They want us to accept what they're saying and keep quiet.
"But it is not normal for there to be so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will have a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good a president as when he was governor," said Olvera, member of Congress of Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, reports prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter alleged abuse of Bradley Manning during detention.
The trial involves the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's sequestration has taken place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of decapitating thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the greatest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that registrations of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints concerning his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring the Manning case to be closed on the grounds that the sequestration took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This analyst of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having taken away thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that his guards reserved was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in the prison was "very professional".
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked him directly about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed an oral concern about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I did not raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had given him this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and safety.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to be removed from this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and once passed away because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said, Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongues, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned at night, they woke him up so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a cover during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he had to release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his tie or tongue to hurt himself, but he had not.
That night Manning testified that his underwear, his tongues, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if convicted before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty to the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should arrange for the conditions of detention to be justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all charges are held, the accused shall be held in criminal detention for life.
My Mexican American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
The signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for the "Extranjeros" ("Etrangers").
I remained immobile for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, like the one my friends in Boston use when they say they're Irish, or my friends in New York when they say they're Italian.
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that has seen my grandfather born, no need for special qualification or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the Strangers line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their main themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons the Mexicans were forced to stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half their territory to the tip of the rifle in writing.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the least criticism of Mexico, you are beginning to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, that we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they change us as if we were inferior individuals and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many of the Mexican Americans I know do not feel like being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen's music.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are regarded as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate a little more the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as fortune ambassadors to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that absolutely must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And if we consider the unequal pay, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans always want them the way their family members have been treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same fuzzy arguments remain to know who began, dozens of buildings were dusted; over 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has been a great success, and whether you want it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this mortal deadlock.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first sight, it seems difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the supporters of the force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has hit a raccoon.
To have killed some of its leaders and to return the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded parts of the planet, Israel has not succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Arab Islamists is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has made a cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members cheer and say that the growing Islamist is turning around from Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where the Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily relying on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of the last wave of violence.
Most importantly, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fire in Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that invades the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicist party, the one of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the close of the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian bastards sleep by giving them a state of affairs?
If they headed the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will take it away; but it may be that the Arab Spring changes it.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is good augur-- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a garbage dump that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable persons found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, in the short and short term, is that the ceasefire will give the outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now endeavour to put an end to the movement of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr Obama also has every interest in Israel's agreement to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of ill organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law, which came into force in Australia, is a world premiere, logos and colours have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and the representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamour.
Studies have shown that if people do not start smoking before the age of 26, 99% of them are likely to never start smoking.
"Even when they're very young, children understand the message that tobacco manufacturers send through their branded image," said the Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have, for example, revealed that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
While Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would boost the black market, which would provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"This legislation will have adverse consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgeries in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrific packagings, has increased significantly two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population segment targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on TV, sport sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is an indispensable place for excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in the contributions of some citizens lambda in favour of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulations in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new justice decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know about them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which there is a picture of the tumor of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that makes me stop is my little girl.
James Yu, managing the "King of the Tobacco Pack" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made storage of packages on display difficult.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising arms in the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait until another plane arrived.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (do not forget the duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in child development praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the trouble with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes up very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffitis that evoke the boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that he has been defined and discussed in different ways," said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After having travelled through many publications and submitted the idea to a group of around 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as an experience that consists of "willing to do something, but not reaching out for a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he would like it to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a mute mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
The boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood stated that if the two can be linked, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while the depressed think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unloyd Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to cassettes, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard too high a sound from the side room of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the sound band at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were bored more than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "such as looking at objects on a assembly line, music can help you not to be bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when one torturing oneself or knocking, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigo learn more and retain more information than children who are forced to stay undisturbed," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Empty Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions like, "From the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls," said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, requiring many and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blushed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework at home, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents reported bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's trouble rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "Adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest on my question, is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take absurd physical risks, bet or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boredom and creativity," said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for over two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has found out that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this authorization goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to be entertained, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the trouble.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant brothing that is generated by activities and technology is the goal to which we should tender.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but the boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stop times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his or her consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here, and in Washington State, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been categorized without further delay.
The police stopped indicting adults 21 years and older for the minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative electoral districts of Colorado have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what's in store for the future," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most marijuana regulatory states, first about therapeutic use and now about personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to authorised marijuana and bans the installation of cannabis sales shops within 30 km of a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to establish an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for the Legalization of Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Chief of Police, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute those 21-year-olds with small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this type of crime "in the immediate sense."
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new justice decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the District Attorney (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, has a more rigorous vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to put pressure on users to disintoxicate themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence which, at the time of the crime, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana restricted consumption initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appears as adults for limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all cases of marijuana detention.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities reveal the profound ambivalence among local officials in terms of the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their lives legalizing those who used marijuana, too, they have trouble accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
While defenders and government officials are planning a new limit on legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting the federal government's guidelines, which continue to design marijuana sales and culture as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed the sales of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to be practiced in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to sink the doors to seize small drug bags, it is a good thing to bet that it is opposed to the licensed trades for the sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Even before the vote, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservator).
It is not only today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My older father and brother studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to take my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were upset.
L'Evening Standard's newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson made a factual statement that I was gone after being forced to drink in drunk cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather extraterrestrial name, or because I was from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowing, I was subjected to racist and barbaric behavior: my regret father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a part of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, please tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right") devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who is moving to Rolls-Royce, is wearing a full silver and is moving with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even having met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the JCR towards those who are right-wing.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think this way in my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and of a paralysing shyness.
The Conservative party's hatred was very virulent.
The previous year the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinian vibrations.
As early as the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found that the teachers were not only involved in sarcasms towards Tory students, but also that they were enjoying it.
It was as if the government's policy on minority strikers, privatization and opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easy to move.
"Is thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said with a harpous tone.
I went back to my room, unconsolable.
During dinner there, I sat alone and felt a light tape on my shoulder.
He was a second year student in English, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's how it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This stratagem failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took the chorus again.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the night fell?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was an Foreign Policy Advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never here.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its accession to the Marxist-Determinist perspective of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professor position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to take a shuttle between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, fell under pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a working session led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously of the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Domestically acting of shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and treating them as "old mad".
The delay was short-lived.
It's my father who sank the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed rugged in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors abandoned.
When they left, I took my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never returned.
You can treat me with wet chicken weed.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Minister Tory, but also has an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian consummate.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in Britain's capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of high sewing created for his sewing home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ of a story whose only protagonist is "it signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy's cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophy of his social ascent: from the modest tailor of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet.
There's nothing wrong with loving kingship.
"At least, they don't crush their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet like some stars do in pop music," said Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to our Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a friend of the beauty of the past, such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the couturist's charism either.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Spain in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began to work with him during the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go through fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Noble Line Detachment
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves the very tall people and with the greatest titles and they also like it.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a sixty-metre-wide glamour podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "public" of dream bearing Valentino's main creations, like the tailor whom Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norge, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "can't be forgotten".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he made me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duchence.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Modest Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a steering skirt, a torn buster and a fall-off.
"It was a dream that became reality," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, it is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg preserves the costumer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the souvenirs she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress taken during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the dresser thus calls his dressers) to realize this silk ivory dress with incrustions of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a trail of four meters and a half.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of customers of high society".
Over the years, Valentino has been the best representative of the nobility's "knowing" nature.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated by the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' spouses.
"Its fineness, calmness, well-kept and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes," admits Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steeped stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case with Antoine Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the ends of the earth solidifies to the contact of the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steeped trails.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted porters put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise look, keeping balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen's minors earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, it forms a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carry the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters above sea level.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents of Euro) because this ore is very present in daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid rupees 15,000 (EUR 1.20) per day and where the monthly average wage is rupees (EUR 167) ", says the holder who used to work as a mason on Bali's tourist island.
There, his salary was Rs 75,000 (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead of doing the job of a mule.
It shares an insular wooden mask with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur always pours out at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defiant of darkness, Anto descends into the crater by flashing himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid for by weight.
Moreover, they also do not touch one of the 30,000 roupies (EUR 2.50) of photo camera addition, in addition to the entrance of 15.000 roupies (EUR 1.20), which the guards of this natural park bill the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old executive who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which are of course added their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one the human mules do of the Kawah Ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeians blame this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pastilles, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a font in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill "their national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in that country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we have said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$ 1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A Government measure for marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, it was considered the renewal rate in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, states that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the formation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that abound with hardly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration was also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has a known impact on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in defined areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single life style and discourage promoters who wish to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the EL Developers real estate company, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state-owned city.
If these new regulations were to be a step towards increasing the national birth rate by discussing with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it would appear that they would not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it back later," says a young person.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the private domain we can protect from any intrusion".
What is in the private sector for under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does it include the dangers it poses by disseminating events on the Internet that it would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "some very personal" with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool," he says.
The young boy recognizes that it is difficult to publish obscene photos, people who have been killed, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends in a quick way," he says.
He claims that he would never accept an unknown person's request.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend an alien to him.
The case of José, aged 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"This doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber harassment are not foreign to the young boy.
A close relative of one of my friends was beaten up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it into a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, he would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cybercrime," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, Professor of English and Dismissed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the aim of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who owns a master in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Migrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who need to teach them here, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or told at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Teaching not to do that doesn't do anything," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Everyone on the Internet needs to act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and education advisor, states that it is essential that parents read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that it is not necessary to talk to foreigners.
The Summit of the United Nations has concluded without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Fourth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration having been made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations Security Council, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit was closed, and then claimed that it would be published from one moment to another on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that the content of the text had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information between journalists was reported by the press officers of some of the governments of the United Nations that attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Later, the Peru Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Arab South American Summit (ASPA) and, although this was requested by the press, it had also not issued the declaration called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ISPA website, it can be verified that the document has been published in March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court, which sets a different borderline between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima filed against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve today's disputes in this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving President Humala a handcuff, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been suspended from Usur since 2011 after the resignation of former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly afternoon in Lima.
The representative read the outcome document, in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime would set up "important steps towards achieving the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "co-operation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the low-cost Internet in all South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "Economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphant matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and provide a better future for our people," President Humala concluded.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the President of Peru in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the cross-sectional axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although it did not provide any more details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will enable its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and well-connected with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before beginning the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which is going to ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to assist in taking power from the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence terms in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the United Nations, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "were killed during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the countries members of the United Nations Security Council.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andine Community, but there are still areas of reaction that we want to belong to the past." he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador supported the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who repel our ears never compromise anything, on the other hand, we South American have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington, D.C., under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but, on the contrary, he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system, which demanded that he submit to his own territory for questioning about an alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation makes it possible to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to her since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the President of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This is about anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of an exception which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stresses that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Barristor Baltazar Garzón has launched a series of proceedings before various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Great Britain gave the exception tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that what he would not tolerate was "pity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, it was gratifying that this is not such a type of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and follow the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay within the United Nations at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coups", because in reality, "this was destroying the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador regards as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the will to move forward together.
They must be solved in their entirety in order to exceed them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that it was "beneficiary for Latin America to seize international forums if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment".
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to postponing a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is rather difficult".
Correa assured that if it lost primarys in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential mandate and I would then withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Vice-President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur), which concluded with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when she was confirmed with the HIV positive test.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid him from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about him and his obsession was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
There is no doubt that he is one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG) in which he was in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was silent".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes it as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS Infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system assignment that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reached a 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as it will remain under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," explained the interviewed scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that Mexicans' life expectancy is now on average 76 years.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of persons who have died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national data have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Of at least the last 12 years, we've never missed medication, the problem is that patients arrive at advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it from advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to carry out more early diagnosis and, for that purpose, to propose massive screening tests to all those who are asking for it."
The specialists and members of Jalisco's State AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I blow up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
So far, his parents only know he's suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share her intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to her testimony, those who are afraid today during World AIDS Day march.
Let them test, if they take risks, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given 100 packages, it is very good, but as a result, still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold to counters, but that they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that young people use.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to those already sexually active," he stressed.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the country's 4th State in number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination occurs by sexual means, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
It appears, therefore, that the survival procedures of Mexican law-authorized companies are not valid in the country at the starry banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement rendered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexico's defenceless companies facing the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to bring the United States Supreme Court to trial on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge reports that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the fifth round Appeals Court, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing cooperation in international procedures in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of Commercial Law International had been created to that end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-corporation vote recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts owed by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts had been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Deficits.
Furthermore, what is certain is that since the subsidiaries' votes remained, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the United States courts, i.e. the "wow" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data is missing from the Appeals Court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had faced since 2008 without ending the serious economic crisis in the United States, affecting costs in the country.
For the time being, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal so that the vote will take place in its entirety, that is, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The claim for insurance will claim non-prosperity and will require the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("the court's friend") in which the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act were detailed, noting that it freed it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
He also noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parties: they sum up Vitro and they sum up the land.
General assessment
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Aviation Company against the ex-patron of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 Trust Committee of Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Hotel Professional Authority.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're sitting on the Dragon Mart.
At the end of the week, in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the Great Wall country, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly located on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has highlighted a Senate requirement to explain the terms and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contrefaçon Commercial Agreement, known as ACTA's English seal, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has become clear that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debt without affecting the short-term debt, the Homex real estate developer started the Value Exchange market for 500 million pesos.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my life"
Hetin Reyes basketball globe-trotter spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemns him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his itinerary out of standards, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most affectionate is those who remind him of his appearance as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It's been my best years, the ones I've most enjoyed because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships fought from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired during the 1981 championship, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been the leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me: "I have a cost-effective player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the big manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's expenses and duties on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived at 4th and where we would have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game, said Reyes.
Is the World 1990 team the best national team you've seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and put a tie on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Houruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his path in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Portoric leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the nation's most glorious time between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left of you?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field personnel and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball matches.
And of course, I take advantage of my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), made himself known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man without scruples, fearsome and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate without scrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday evening of complications of cancer, according to a news release from the family sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing once again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of her wife in the original series and in the follow-up, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press officer Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his life in full," Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis at Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with malignant liver tumours and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of my Dreams" series broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two shows that have remained on the air for little time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in cinema, there are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of J.R.'s deliciously detestable performance that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and its relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant him and then threatened him to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to assault him.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to imprison his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to do as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-gist the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already complete for the second season and one sixth is being completed, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who known the celebrity with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scene of the New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where residents of many celebrities lived.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s ruthless memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be fine."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that there he launched an irresistable hook: the end of the "great count" of the calendar Maya, on 21 December, to which many people referred as evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax guff which some have nicknamed "the Debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would start.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said this week Professor Charmé to his Rutgers-Camden University students in New Jersey.
If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and told, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which in theory will be the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Wacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse this because these ideas are growing over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world did not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students have to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed the day before the Apocalypse, which does not leave the students any choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world", said Restall.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people can do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have viewed all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less one teacher, told us not to believe at the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie saile, a last-year student at Temple, 21-year-old from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar," said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety associated with apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
Most of this is English speaking.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years there has been talk of the many dates assumed in the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start to think about the next date" or to think about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to parties "from the end of the world".
"Sometimes, I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old in communications.
