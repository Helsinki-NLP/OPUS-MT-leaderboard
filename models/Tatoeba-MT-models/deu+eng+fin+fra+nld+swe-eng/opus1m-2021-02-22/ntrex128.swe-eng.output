AM in Wales is worried that "becomes like pucks"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales following plans.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who cannot Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
One AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative walesare said that his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation for the amendment of the name, said: "The final decision for what members of the Assembly should be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support in calling the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The title of AM was proposed by the Commission to Welsh Parliament Members ( Wales Parliamentary Members) or WMP, but MWP received the highest level of support in a public consultation.
It is clear that AM proposes other options, but problems with reaching consensus may cause problems for President Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what they shall be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia conducts a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote if they wish to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's are silent when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither one nor one."
He said it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"People hang out in other ways now," he said.
"Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that " sooner or later they will end up on square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments with apartments filled with persons who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, called the proud music game "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some of whom were hired by the church's playmanship, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church assembly – the congregation’s governing body of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church assembly, even though the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some congregation members complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark damages 13-year-old who dives for lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had appeared with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bit!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that the whole keybone had been torn up.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water. "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
Bathkeeper Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with merchandise-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household markets, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s efforts to fill the shelves previously raised by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain greater space with highlighted areas, such as in stores such as Boots.
The store chain also launches its boutique makeup brand again so that most of the products are vegan – which increasingly requires young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an effort to fight against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier efforts of the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the proceeds from Boot's sales would be distributed in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can give customers advice.
Our selection of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "raising" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragons Den-Star Peter Jones is "raising" at the fact that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time with their brand True, with leisure clothing and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning, 37, announced its decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-star Peter Jones furious by pulling themselves out of their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "raising" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire last Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer had to focus on their brand True, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw from shock all those involved.
No one could believe it happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the decision of this Morning presenter to withdraw can cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
The couple are staying together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk, and we fell in love.
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy a president" and that he was so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman voice":
"I've given up nothing."
He said Kim wants to have a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea's top diploma, Ri Yong Ho, told the leaders of the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the United States after the first disarmament effort in North Korea.
He noted that the United States instead continued sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
" North Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed out to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok had lost their homes, it was not an exceptional permit, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates everything," Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, it is still sadly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning chip in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rail tracks.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr Joko is also pressed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought the streets with machetes, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scored in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a 89th minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his team was down by 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizalaga's hope and ended up online.
"I was just trying to get in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach and didn't think so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal of 25th minutes from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue star threw a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spined off the middle field and sprinted to the Liverpool side.
Kovavic made a quick give-and-go by the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran off the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting against Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to the VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death rate in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the spills of buildings falling into the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of rubble from buildings that fell apart.
The police arrested a man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was cut to death.
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police informs the victim's closest relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one could enter or leave the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can enter again.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up on the spot.
She says, "It's so bad" over and over again.
At 14:00, there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
Please send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliamentary statue of Cromwell's latest victims of controversy over the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "deepness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace should be withdrawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his forefather Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the views of the 1800s and is part of the historiography of a man who many still believe should be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murderous pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a stia on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pig house nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pig house with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
Pigs rarely attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it off.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa for vast heavy rain to the South-West USA
As expected, hurricane Rosa will become weaker as it travels across cooler waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooded rain to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sundays and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create extensive heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will result in 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the South-West United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that someone goes out into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Strong rain can make canyons to rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and sloping roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of central and eastern America are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a greater chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million watched Thursday’s pervasive testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock and the normal broadcast continued for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona's Senator Jeff Flakes' agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she's absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tapped her when he was drunk trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
By comparison, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or the Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second largest number of 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him trying to take an elevator to an interview with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters screamed at him, as was shown in CNN’s live broadcast.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judicial Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do that if the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" on the future of Britain and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The medical examiner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for the escape force, the police's state law lab, Southern University police and residents of the area for the help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for their "quite and effort for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about things like this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano sprinkling ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several moles and scales.
Pictures of social media showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake at 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police meet Catalan Separatists for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence demonstrations struck together with the mandatory police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demanding police threw eggs and paint powder on them, leading to dark dam clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later in the day, and police used their battalions to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists called "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The voice is still tense in the region longing for independence one year after the referendum on the first October that was considered illegal by Madrid but was praised by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop voting at electoral stations in the region.
Independent groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the Separatist protests with his wife and said that he no longer believes Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have had difficulty holding the momentum up this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in jail pending trial on their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been celebrated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for office in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the understatement we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30 p.m. BST last Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid welcomes Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winnings to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against two visitors
The Holts team should have taken the lead long before they scored goals; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nesting across the target.
The home malaget was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was done.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which scored goals from the middle of the target area.
In this situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger goalie Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings came constantly into Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two criminal requirements – after Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a cleverly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home once – and it is something of a wake-up bell for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited the smile and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have been deprived of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the fragmented views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some German Turks and is condemned as a single ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: The cyclist dies in a crash by car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
Krocken took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficked road in Deptford, South East London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and nurses were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The body takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a transmission accident on Children Street, around 1.5 km from the crash last Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 am BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial damage.
One spokesman for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident on HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be subjected to the police and may have an increased prison sentence."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a law enforcement officer was called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when hurricane Rosa's remaining energy draws over the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona border.
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5 to 10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, probably receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, the Rosas rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the South-West United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power in Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may experience heavy rain, which represents a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5 to 15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger of Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the south-west USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in the teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 AM BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the disregard of the democratic party and scandalous tactics," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the evil, anger of the democratic party throughout the whole nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexualizing her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the fashion of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are trying "to resist and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, rise
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu last Friday when waves of up to six meters high crashed towards the beach at dusk and swept many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning arrived yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency BNB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but carried cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything in its way," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the Agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as much as the atomic bomb released at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "overall" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building hears frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water will crash towards the beach and sweep away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a major power outage that disrupted all communication around Palu, making rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights there with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuees are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Staff from the World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu where they seek shelter during demonstrations at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the difficult work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an exceptional permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been announced."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove themselves to be the miracles that brighten up gloomy natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a clown.
Last Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's National Air Force, had trained two of the missing paragliders before the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the screen flying vet, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the paragliders heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey goat, instead of two blues.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver had cleared a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
All those who have information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes its name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter this Saturday and said, "The being that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yanghi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set up for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without bindings and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during a era when left-wing student movements broke root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on field research, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements on AI, although the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
A twice as big budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States," said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sanovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that hit the top ranking American Othello player, and later he was in the lead of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be like to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funds from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, it's the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has made no progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on name change
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday if the name of the country was to be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic", which would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the consent of the agreement with Greece?"
However, supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of this House have said that they are going to follow the outcome in order to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and place chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and Europe, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to much needed investment in Macedonia, which has more than 20% unemployment.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "reconfirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies, between 30 and 43 percent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls under the minimum required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 per cent of registered voters must vote plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the policy of the Western-oriented government since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero gets through the entire Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England this Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defensemen and went out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defenseman and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial victory in the Premier League battle.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's reir on that game.
He sent a nice fire along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff, so there was no reason to force one forward.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which lies a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still has a chance for the playoff.
Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday night, but is still looking for his first division title.
"We don't play anything, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
The Nationals have not announced their launch for Sunday yet, but according to reports they lean against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was to make his 34th start, warmed up the bullpen last Thursday and threw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to speak in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is necessary, you see their wickedness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggles to "stand against and prevent".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "worry and mean and horrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judicial Committee, which was confronted by a very eager response from the spectators.
"You remember what she said?
"Did you leak the document?"
'Eh, eh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a..." It was really bad body language, something of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized not to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically enough, similar subjects that Jeremy criticised earlier leaders.
The message of Friday's meeting with Nottingham East Labour said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of 'friendly, more cautious' policies has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the leader of the party accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political vision that I expected to make a full turnaround and take positions that I would never otherwise have followed – be it the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a drag of unconsciously on social media that requires me to be laid off, criticizes middle policy and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just hurt me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me most of the time are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this policy is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change of the selection rules the party becomes more narrower.
I've had many advice in the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "it's okay."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher government's neglect, which literally made my primary school's classroom collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest choice.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's appeal, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – Labour members as well as others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of disengagement or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unslaged Ayr on top
Two last minute attempts may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested during our matches so far and are still undone, so we're obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "It's worth it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose speak the numbers and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the management again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to handle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flank Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been identified as the CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for the life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Abetriebsmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Costless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a hard-covered headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas bear the motto: "The port belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also longing to sail on the Pacific once again.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and obviously awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens over the country, hoping that the Court in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision is also very important for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court judges in the interests of Bolivia, and that not much would be changed even if it did.
The Court of Justice of the United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years could have hurt more than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been closed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has affected Chile's remaining benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken exceptionally quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "set a stop for 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crucifixion.
"Bolivia will never give up her right of access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that the nation will not rest its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the deadlock for nuclear disarmament over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it's a "willful dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever embarrass North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a gunsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge headlines on their way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers have revealed a range of kinky, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blinded the styles of Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's first creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a spring-like broad brush that completely took over the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a wizard hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had bonded lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass tube.
And if you continue the enormous fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hedges can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come just after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm bridge that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia lashes and a white leather handle, was excellent in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
"I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial to global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector capable of designing and implementing adapted curricula, we see modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are the highest on the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the upper-grade exam.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics in curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
Having said that, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have joined a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person automatically provides a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and in which French was the only language that totaled two-digit (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered most important for the UK for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and bring them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
In a global economic environment, languages are undoubtedly still crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capability".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate at the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the run-up to the November elections.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interrogation of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was tensed after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus, President Trump said that these five conventions next week aim to "commit volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in public opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in public opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the couple races of Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport concept, but something that the players really believe in, and more than ever before for competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're wearing it like a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points' advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four were.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and takes a good example.
The wine troupe peeled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-squares when he and Thomas had been behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the game of 15 met with a similar whirlwind, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really need to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undeniable story.
Europe's odd but charming couple are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bugey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience’s reactions confirm that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process a short deal with Sergio Garcia, the 400th hero of the morning, together with Alex Noren.
A bugey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never even came near to get out.
However, on Sunday no one will help you out of the hole.
Four ball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a struggle that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage at Ryder Cups last day after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home with four points at the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who struggled to keep the trophy as they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it wasn't enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into a four ball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who beat through two matches on Saturday, showed some moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four ball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the win with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has one team come back from a four-point downside in the singles matches, however Furyk's side only needs a continuous result to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says "never" will disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations this Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to an approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would result in North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "the settlement first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to "the declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The understanding that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful voice for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump as US leaders emphasized at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach America's mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "wrong completely" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failing until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear missile complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving against normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine filled "divings".
One academic study found that students at the world's leading university are often unthinkable about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleeping habits helps academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered from severe sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep loss and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students directly.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "dying" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapons" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn on the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men
Rangers suffered another loss today as Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 side of Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to equalize the result.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and lies just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the slope for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight semifinal changes in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a score from Hearts last week and he would have been happy with the way his well-sold game overshadowed the opponents each time.
Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep freepark from Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it looked to be more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo knew for sure that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson threw away the Colombian invitation.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a domestic kick from Oviedo Ejaria.
Liv's 34th minute opening shot may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their squealing deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's solid situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch almost immediately gave effect when the outer ball hit Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the experiment.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett waving up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead in the last stage, but McGregor managed well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
The Rangers translator Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was beaten with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manuscript called Geiger meters.
Geiger meters have become a foundation stone for science since then and are also prominent in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it pops now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was taken out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a fainting appearance in which he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would run for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great hat on him, he screamed at the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you feel about Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the play of West's exhibition was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to push West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed for his headband.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to fall low too?" and he said, " place my superman cape on, because that means you can't say what I'm allowed to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said, "It was death-stupid in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with its appearance of the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the chief of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls:
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was itself and it's wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") whom I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we're doing, she added.
Before the show, the rappers on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the being previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They for attempted murder after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man is stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The event occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to arrive at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Fights Toxic Masculine
Kit Harington is known for its sword-rolling role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has made a negative statement about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actor in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I feel personally pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV may partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued "What is native and what is learned?
What lessons are being learned on TV and on the streets, which make young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to a close next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character Jon Snow fall in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter only.
Most new cases were transmitted via six and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in the case of intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the tasks of the GOP Senator, shielding "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned Saturday’s claims that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democracy claimed that these claims were spread through right-wing extremist websites.
"Lows, lies, and more repugnant lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
According to information released, home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from the former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the substance of the statement of reasons.
They must be calm and safe."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was a candidate for Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Quiet of truth," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit in every new film with British inclination, and the same seems to apply to this replay of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parades that were fired in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satir be about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been licensed to customer in fact renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English speaking countries
He is of course the weird secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims for smoothie glamour has received a small piece of Clouseau, a spark Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two nice moments in the last JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades hit his helmet for a short moment.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels quite low and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny Svenska's strange was not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie bravader in the role of Bean.
The subject at hand is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
An cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent's great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last strand of a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-earned institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and rejoined with his former persistent sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and hit Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve the UK computer breach: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odysse of old-fashioned performance: dressed as waitresses, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for the British to work a four-day week but receives pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that is based on the British working a four-day week - but is paid for for five.
The party wants, according to the task of business leaders, to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
That would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea was to "pass" the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative of the higher laboratory said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens that promised a four-day work week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not marked by a labour force as a whole.
One Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and that's nothing the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "non-faced leaders" and "syllables" on state-owned companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their entire stake back, because a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive has been incorrect deeds.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's equity is transferred to its employees, which is then to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the statement came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unquestioning."
However, Graham's voice seems unwavering.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and that would be a dynamite complaint," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a hugely impressive set of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people on their way to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty before 2030.
According to a statement from 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "measures" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, ringing or in other meaningful ways contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been for 12 years to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its adherents who have fought for a variety of goals.
It states that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders who are committed to "help children develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the region after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken that require the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the usual questions on his website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's New York event, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicates the Minister of the Interior
The government can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including the Middle East, the American Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Mr Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "day-span" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
After the Trump administration's objective is to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disagree with a third party's interference with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to stand in the presidential election 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take an "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. mid-year election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take a real thinker to run for the presidential post."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "taken this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been acquitted in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not think she would be running for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through now that he is back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are going back with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the complainants in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Freedoms Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang member sons" mistreated her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gangs and violence in their homes.
The new American asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the- court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the US economy, and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary labour force".
In June, the Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperata rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more bleak.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Pure water is a shortage."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured persons, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftersliding.
With tears in his eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't escape.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's Daily paying an addition to the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the United States' 6th Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China's early reimbursing tariffs in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, in a debate article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, wrote Branstad, "Now the bullying is doubling by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread the propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper scene on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of different voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers looted the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters before the mid-year election through Kavanaugh-fiascot, warns analysts
Since many high republicans defend the nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court who faces several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn the clock back," says Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesting "November will come!", when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building, when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony on allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It's not just a matter of the committee's vote or the final vote, or of Kavanaugh coming through, it's also about how Republicans handled this and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic electoral campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate court committee during the oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her sexual organs while they participated in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to make lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed high over a night.
"We do not ask them permission."
In an post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Viktoria Cross during the First World War celebrated
The only priest in the English church who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during the First World War is now celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "quickly symbolic" that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later ran up to the shooting line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "anything I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stopped up all night looking at Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live in the UK at channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after they had stayed awake for the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed children's program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the transmission.
"Greta Gris, yes"
Bellators CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution with regard to the recovery," Coker said.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset many people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was, in fact, a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our effort to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "substantial" due to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his comrades during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has been released for a few months due to illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less host" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy of me and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and took advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he was lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-time world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "come as a surprise".
Dale married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games - where he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first selection - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and which still gave him Russians.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day acting cheers and training in his game in hopes of having a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the loved one of the drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long ruffen often penalizes hard.
It is not only the course that deters, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the ahead of the 12 singles games, have a win at the start, the Mickelsons game can be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we're gonna have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people, and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a team under the leadership of Seven Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the minimum margin with the result 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and nod," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, we'll give you everything.
Goes out and does everything right.
This is not over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and it is a completely different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is fully tested.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go out and get the best of himself."
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great reversals during the last days of a race, both in the winning team in Brookline before he stopped as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as quickly as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-games.
We made our stand and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choice.
Germany's new warships are postponed again
The German fleet's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air and maritime missile, as well as some sneaking techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are taken into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fatal F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Shortcomings in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which leads to a deterioration in performance and limits the marine’s ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including crew training - will also be a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates will be particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "starting to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said it was a growing problem because old ships were being dismantled but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the southern and dwarf pistrell as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed field view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor to NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Fladdermus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the habitat and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from housing taxes.
Fladder mice aren't actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, check bills and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vet trees and a lot of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before maintaining properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eliminate an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are feeling."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) rejected the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the requirements were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After having met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where, according to his report, he must have raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "afraid of retribution" and worried about "becoming humiliated publicly".
34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "should regret it forever" if you lost your status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, the business minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "throat" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily stop producing at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - producing Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stoppage in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is what the car producers say is the risk to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without any agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock consumption at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future EU relations is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to take advantage of this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4's program Today.
"The comments from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said, "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "imposed for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has given Washington quakes fuel for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying wire equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deploying the President through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "pretend" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's Legal Committee's interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual injustice, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for that has not been fixed, it can happen this week, or a delay of one week in view of all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest this claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any objection to TV reports like "playing for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland with regard to Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS in order to express the country's gratitude and the desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, before decisions are expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's effort, regardless of nationality.
European colleagues and the rest of the world provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health care and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after suffering from head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported the Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the page line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a strap was carried out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/ extent of the injury than" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five fingers on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp tax when buying UK property, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory's new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The raising of stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Department of Finance expects to receive up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with more affordable housing promises and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional levy is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on leisure homes and dwellings purchased to rent out. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will attract up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-off areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new game will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax to help more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing with affordable prices to solve Britain's "deplorable housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a spectacularly sufficient proposal for housing reforms, including the rent ceiling and an end to the blasphemy without the tenant's fault.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard-working residents in our country.
Too many people have become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to practice Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old shot is looking forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-land team and that's it," Ross says to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to run a club."
Ross has representatives from Sunderland, including Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I judge success on the basis of the answer to the question 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely at home in the Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15 month long sejour as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa to come back from the downfall to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road reason," he recalls, pointing out when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was entirely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had good results and could live well on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
That's a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I have always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I have ever done throughout my adult life."

An investigation shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has resulted in increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been pressed more heavily.
The figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the company advisory company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we had to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The 1.8% decrease in the turnover of restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars that offer beverages in particular showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar which offers food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to have wanted to go out and drink something.
The result of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in the sale of large kitchens.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more inhospitable for companies driven by food sales. Time may indicate whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any much needed respit."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry supervisor Couffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on how it works for 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One out of five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that sexual content is posted there
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The result is late in worrying that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of the students stated that they have a clean "main account" that they can show for their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who tripped over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Queens on the Board of the Scottish Sports Federation, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Governing Body's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized freeskier, and the President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the entire Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost his ability to walk after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that if I recovered, and to what extent, the time had to be extended.
It has been hard work, but I have completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows parts internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused differences on the internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that become milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie released a music video-based commercial film with humorous appropriations to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hip-up barn with cows for a song with lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and, "If you didn't know it, this isn't a dice, but tits."
The refrigerant continues: "Pump out, pump out, feed the babies, pump out, pump out, milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused battles on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light over the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another addition is: "What a reality-absolute commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," writes someone.
Another comment: "This is a fun commercial film that turns to mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'cushions'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump stuck in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breast-feeding bath, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and an ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pumped breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognisable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothing by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of migrant children deprived of liberty has increased even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump Government have made it more difficult to place the children of the reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and afraid to put their own chances of staying at stake by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential referees and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints, and that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of persons who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were previously unknown by law enforcement authorities.
"Nearly 80% of the persons who are themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be brought into court within one month after they were deprived of their liberty, rather than after 60 days, as was the practice in the past, according to staff at the establishments.
Many of them are on video link rather than personally to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of their liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to staff at the camps and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child having a more difficult time is more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and to say goodbye to friends, the traumas many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Damascus government would continue to "combat this sacred blow until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that these circumstances were good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that makes refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicalizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that reconstruction will not help Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel fortress Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement dismissed a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who will "be wiped out".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and members of the opposition, in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the Group's work would be limited to "a review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ended prematurely through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of best broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news evenings.
"This is like a fire people are drawn to, because that's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitol.

She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," says Nell Scovell to me.
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington’s reports can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for 15,000 dollars ("a garment filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trump, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of the things he does that make it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating roll crew of the Trump-team and daily intrigues (muck up dispute with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and hung indoors and watched MSNBC while recording a transmission from CNN.
He couldn't tear himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be presented to the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the bowl.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most even race ever before the mid-year choice
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congressional Districts receive a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that two members are now competing for the same place.
This recently surrounded suburb of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrafted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major party economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a broad-based surveillance special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had made some headway for the Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese aid but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners blew off the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the US Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of US missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said the department's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit hard on the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
One speaker for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, as described by the three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next inevitable step could be the report of the special investigator Robert Mueller on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, which is now evident in public records.
Mueller is also reported to be running his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign was cooperating with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change majority, Trump would be held accountable to that assembly just as he is preparing to re-election, and perhaps finally to a citizens' jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the extended fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood up to him and stood behind the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the unwavering progress of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that he should have proposed last year to secretly record the President, speculating that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times report doesn't match.
"How shall we answer whether the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he may appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in mid-year elections at a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me away to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hooker.
With that as a legacy, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal, which ended indefinitely earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says 31-year-old.
"We entered the game in the belief that we could get something, and left with a point.
Perhaps we could have gotten it in at the end, but in the whole thing it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and it was better team.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can sure get ahead and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people participating in the country-wide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a big impact on costs.
Help your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a life insurance hybrid solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you have advice.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a health care professional, so that you can appoint a trusted person who will review your medical care and ensure that your health care professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your economy.
You will then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"Not only is the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medication is that?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is done."
Fired several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns when he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place at about 02:30, as a "one-time event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are calling on the Witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It reports officials. The death figure is expected to rise.
The communications are out of order, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administration area, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated to 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that extends over 300 km of the northwestern Sulawesis coast.
In 2017, the administrative area, which is an administrative region in one province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
The main pillars of the Central Sulawesis economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia's disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Even in 1996, the western Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circusic seismic fire, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on the northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's richest island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people killed.
2016: A fundamental earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings falling apart.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for having submitted a report of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su prison and is held against the $500 bail due if the suspect violates the bail conditions, according to the TV channel KTUUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "unsecured" when he was asked to declare his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three minor crimes under Class A, which means that he can be sentenced to up to one year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, for having committed himself in the reporting of domestic violence and for possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son’s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which originated from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit circulations now on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal Prosecutors call for a rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare sentence that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental truck from the construction and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan. He hurried down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may involve a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide-ranging planning and intent," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov performed it as "detestable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern districts have not prosecuted a target of a decade's death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who stated that they are "of course disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits himself guilty only extends the trauma that these events have caused for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tories said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel hot" from the EU sceptics when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone said at the start of the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would have already "departed" if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit minister.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in bringing the deeply divided adherents to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack by Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to get an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and 'caos'.
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted the "spola Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and had responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers agreement".
He made his opposition to the EU clear and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "Thanks to the fact that the British would have changed and now want to stay behind is totally unlikely."
Brexit fan Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and talked to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular for the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular for the party and for our election workers who are on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were to fail the decision made by the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not gonna let you get away with it."
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU members marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved with banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MEP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technologies for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for office
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to get a "ordinary thinker to run for the presidential post" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about his future during a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been under speculation that maybe she'll take on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she planned to run for the presidential post.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death of basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul for the media on Saturday through the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went between us to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been there and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 starts last season, and scored 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team order gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on a drought when he defended his position during the first two yards, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and let Hamilton drive in at the back of the blade, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a bit of wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of being invited to the scene after a double stroke to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and was seventh at the end of the first shipyard on his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and run over Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he arrived in the pit of 44th shipyard but was unable to raise pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a first and a second," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for maintaining that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "delicate, unsettled and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, uncomfortable and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"We leaked... no, we leaked nothing," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented on it like this: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of the sexual offences of three women, and he indicated that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite, the digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sonated Friday’s loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the returbate 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants got an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offered for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard offered Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 at the assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who scored at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home malaget regrouped and Bouchard scored again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will be playing against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so hundreds of people on a plane could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now praised as a hero after he died making sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could be lifted safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the brute of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly-swept Control Tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely lift.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are crushed to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death rate can rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief agency says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Agency.
Up to six-metre-high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance with dead bodies comes.
There's no clean water.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking planet and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water as it tried to land at the airport on the Chuköarna.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the American fleet both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was sliding past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through mid - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a smaller skull injury.
The American fleet said that sailors who worked nearby developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane sank in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have been killed in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor closed his pleading in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to push together the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night, which contradicts his previous allegations, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis some time after Chambers' death, Chambers deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphopen has come far from its origins in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A baby girl in New York matches a couple because of dismissal after a "racial" text message
A baby girl in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a misposted text message from her mother, complaining that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "expression."
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed fear when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black, when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEELY NOT A SPIRIT IGEN", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "like to the mood," and gave Maurice the fire, and claimed that their former child girl, who was an Afro-American, had done a bad job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and was sent home by taxi.
She is now following the couple to receive compensation for the dismissal. She is requesting compensation in the order of $350 per day for the work she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
They were worried that they would not trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "expressiveness" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"Shall one go to such a person?
It is not very nice," added Plasco, the investment banker.
The justice process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple of social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The author of Paddington Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, given what we know now about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was proud of her ultimate success in silence.
"He was quite silent about himself, and not a boasting person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it is not you yourself who have done it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington the glory."
My daughter was supposed to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors did not work to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, and that she was not expected to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not cry or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and tears ran off all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that can be called to receive support.
Sharon Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells us that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile was shining up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his nephew when he died in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to make people know there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, has been missing his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it."It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight further."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would "split down" due to deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-term elections will take place only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad election, which is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean "shrinks" down under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the Korean Ministry of Reunion, says 1 127 people jumped off last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not received any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korea's rappers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees the debauchers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back violently.
The relationship between North and South, which technically remains at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks with a focus on the determined negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was sexually harassed when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed, and the voice stopped talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated murder of character" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she considered that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is partial to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she got the question if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the national court if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Appellation Court of Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not possible for a hysterical and partial person to sit down in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to run out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry, and they'll be happy to be able to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital shop on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of self-election in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since she was late out, she was after the money collection, and gave the promise not to go in as a candidate unless she got two million dollars together.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the vote was held.
"You could have thought I had had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls about the press's reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my gravestone?"
"She cried?"
Why the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening ceremony in the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by posing important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with tariffs.
The most important step forward came this week, with new customs duties on goods for 200 billion dollars, which means in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are taxed.
Beijing has answered with the same coin every time. Recently, fees of between five and ten percent on American goods were dropped for 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match US action. The world’s second-largest economy will probably not step down within foreseeable time.
Making Washington back means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too genant for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war press can give positive support to China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is in fact much more dangerous than the viewers have wanted to admit before," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focused on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returnees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to accept refugees returning voluntarily and appeals for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up areas destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed at their daily lives and subsistence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned with the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The USA has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the outcome of the 16th hole pair 3-track, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranking players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European of the tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It is about the team, and I am glad I could help," said a moved Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the Stafett pin to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's defeating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work on the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You get to bow and knock.
They played better than we did."
Algae blooming: Stops in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algae bloom concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowering is reported in the areas around the municipalities of Pinella, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
Algae blooms along more than 20 km of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out in the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium-high concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium-high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the large municipalities of Pinella, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida the past week.
