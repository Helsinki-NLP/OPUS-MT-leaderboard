The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-olds after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic officers in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they had watched it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before he turned off into the bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who met the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuses a 20-year-old man of non-observance of a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the District Court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rapeing a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and could not signal a consensus."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17th at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"Just as trade unions die, so do the middle class jobs," said Ellison, a politician from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, I proudly present the Staff Entitlement Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in terms of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act to create a possibility for workers subject to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice - and to receive damages or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to reconnect with a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember that country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Aware that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and that their voice should rise in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause which explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim at reducing this right shall be null and void; the measures to be taken shall be unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country was discussing how to form civil and democratic societies in other countries, Americans stated that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and that this trade union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and governmental bodies - must be protected.
Indeed, after these rights have been violated in America, it is very wise to see the American ideal again, as a result of which the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is to enter into force on the 1st of September, would force doctors carrying out abortions to have a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Proponents of abortion welcomed the decision to take the most recent decisions against similar measures in a number of judgments, saying that doctors spent so much more time obtaining hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are missing a law that has failed to take care of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who had complained on behalf of three of the five state clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was extended to doctors from the two clinics who did not join the action and had also applied for the right of referral.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that medical admission rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion prevent the measures from being used to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patientâ€™s rights, reported the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer perform surgery for safety reasons, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, the Government of Louisiana stated that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while applications for patient access rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment can lead to higher mortality rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who were diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines may slow lung and ovary cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for elderly women and those whose cancer was already further advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, she suggested strengthening the service of flown doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more closely to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, showed poor long-term survival rates in women with ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling number of homeowners
The decline, together with an increased fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "garden age group" after a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with their home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure of asphalting for park purposes and the falling garden size are further factors threatening the industry, in which estimated Â£5 billion per year are put into sale.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor to the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising household numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation due to better weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV building again.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now back to broadcasting.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away from it, they delivered collisions with security forces equipped with poles and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The army of the country therefore warns of a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and to apply no violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has been more frequent.
Opposition politician Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif have deceived Parliament in May last year.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to move on to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey appoints US diploma for spying reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country's oldest US diplomats to obtain information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister BÃ¼lent said that the US Embassy's business manager and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had the most important secret service in Germany in the visor, caused much worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The event, announced for 18 to 21 hours, covers all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher LokomotivfÃ¼hrer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight traffic.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Chief of Police of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence to the public prosecutor's office in Mallorca for blackmail by officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ .
The Chief of Police of CalviÃ  on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and barbers in the notorious Binge-Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located, after allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence to the office of the Prosecutor of the Anti-Corruption Office of Mallorca on Friday for blackmail by officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ .
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption charges and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the governmentâ€™s host economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a Suvertour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-absorbed pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organiser Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of â‚¬ 55,000 ($ 73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING provided South Australia with a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 pm another 5mm rain fell to the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down on the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started shortly before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter had provided for an early dose of spring last week, the temperatures in the city again fell to a peak of only 15.8Â°C on Monday.
The harsh weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 pm, but was hit by a windstorm - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
At that time, winds reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at around 8.40 p.m.
The delay in flying resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantum flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16Â°C is predicted for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthias says: Maximum time to network
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switch centers, our columnist Bernd Matthias comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this, my gaze falls at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think Boah, how retro is that?
But behind it is a reflection: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be significantly more retro.
In any case, it applies to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, error of tip: electronic) Sector the rule that the novelty of today is the electrical scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
For example, anyone who still has a tube TV in the living room today simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa at the radio tower again this week brings to our attention our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who was blindly mastered by the former washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with unfathomable expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you all right?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quarks?
Basically, it has been about 20 years, especially because we should properly network our house.
In order for the yogurt to reorder itself, the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it burns in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we left the office to air conditioning on our soon arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: We lift up our watch, say, "Suck!" - and the vacuum cleaner goes home.
I'm not.
Everything goes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods fade," a sector connoisseurs, you can connect the washing machine to a headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which does not help because we stand in the stable.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-mode device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after having spent the summer in shelters, while rocket and mortar shooting at their communities went down during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from fighting.
The launch gave the communities in southern Israel a sense of joy and expectation, drawn by rocket fire holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which was heavily marked by the Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates from the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denied this information and estimated that at least half of the killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of voting rights of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared himself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cut off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Country Manager in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a positive development in the right direction and a development that allows me to come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically opposed and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had just failed at the five percent vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far right party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD tip.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application to Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At NeulÃ¤nder Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all the seams.
Now the Internal Authority has set up three Red Cross tents next door.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to create public reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Green Group chairman at the Harbour District Assembly.
Their party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overfill in the first shot are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
Domestic prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homesteads in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a split market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices only increased by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that, with the beginning of the spring, there would be an increase in real estate for sale for the coming months, which would undergo a "real test" on the market.
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the consistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements made by Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to the fact that he is posing "like a field master".
This is not the style of the university, it says in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already "In mid-June, oral information was given about the idea of the university.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," says PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "forecasts or even decisions", but there were "preferentials".
The expansion of the narrow road necessary for access to the castle was also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was a nine-metre-wide street, and it's not a talk.
It goes according to the current level at 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains PÃ¶tzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-based parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future, PÃ¶tzl does not want to be allowed to apply.
Train parking is not possible at all, because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the locals
According to the President of the University, the Bergwichtel children's club, which is located on the site and would lead the access to the park deck in front of its door, is "not affected".
Rather, he says, "This is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of the Friedrich-Sprohr-StraÃŸe and the 800 pupils of the neighboring real school.
So it's about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parent Advisory Board of the Children's Kreppe, with the expansion of the street would be entitled to a "a few natural spots of Coburg's lost" "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of new developments".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's ship last week about the plans of the university.
Consequently, the access for the new park deck should not, as before, take place via the campus and the Friedrich-Sprohr-StraÃŸe, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would require a two-track expansion of the narrow road about one kilometer long.
According to the high figures of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles a day are spoken of.
On the side of the city, they did not wish to express their views on the project.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt introduced health problems in particular for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the World Champion of 2007 announced on his Facebook page.
He retires with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation" with the Icelandicman, who announced his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my long-term fellow players and my successors.
But I want to be healthy for my club in the coming years too, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had to fear his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated with a cortisone syringe by team doctors from the German Handballbund (DHB) who had later triggered a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass any body without a trace.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
A number of other loophole complaints arise.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that I can control my head, but I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be available for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the stitches tear, I'm always ready to talk," explained the two-time family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I also became quite humble with regard to my health.
After my career I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) he won the EHF Cup.
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy reduced by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy was revived by consumption alone in the spring, while investments went down.
Foreign trade also slowed down economic activity.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste" which led through Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
On Sunday, the town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "bikers".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across MÃ¼nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked their registration with Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through MÃ¼nsterland.
This tour was published in various professional journals and offered to interested visitors.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the MÃ¼nsterland in this way as well", the cyclists enjoyed the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the St.
Katharina went on a small "free ride" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
In addition, the route, which was written out for three different categories, led back to Horstmar via the SchÃ¶ppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were used on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor Heinz LÃ¶lfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization went through no problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz LÃ¶lfing draws a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came, as the organiser had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015, with hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised to return to MÃ¼nsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Constantin Wecker's mercilessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper on 287 pages in "MÃ¶nch und Krieger".
Not chronologically, but more thought-fetches for thought-fetches, the Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from onanie as a gymnasist to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all of this he tries to get to the bottom, in very philosophical but also very personal ways.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul musician and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who "comes through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out all unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-spirited views: such as beatings in a premises frequented by GIs or a crazy drive through which he pointed a tree at the frontal.
He's honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in my arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only stopped his voice: "Listen with the cockroach.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already adults when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than at his father's time, he gained an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a bit lighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep, sty labyrinth with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to lie down in the tub and then he could be heard as he started singing because he could wash the casting of himself.
When I walked around, I realized that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parentsâ€™ testimony of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant short cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies that have filled up their busy working life.
He started at just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/commedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned to work.
I had to grow up not only in the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "painted black," Henry recorded his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it'd never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures who mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like everything is just bringing time around or taking a bit of a step forward."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't hurt it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right on me.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
You seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea went on as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it's like a great sign of the gods saying to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONATE voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbursts while he imitates people again and again.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes go live in Apollo if I want to, but overall, I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemenâ€™s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthiss have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper Yemen Post, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened further escalation of the conflict, his claims should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for greater independence from the Sunni rule of Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi people's tribe has besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered civil servants to contain "spiritual employees"
Kenya has begun to bimetrically register all state officials to delete "spiritual" employees from government salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government assumes that thousands of people will still receive salary even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (Â£700,000) per month in payments to "spiritual" employees and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, was reported in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology were removed from the salary list.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "spiritual worker" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal of the art advisor Helge Achenbach will be first dealt with in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim damages of 19.4 million euros from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings at the DÃ¼sseldorf Landgericht.
This was reported by a judge on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach had betrayed the purchase of works of art and old timers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than the purchase prices actually paid.
This would also have resulted in higher agreed commission rates.
Achenbach has purchased value items for Albrecht for EUR 121 million.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in the school service, 23 of which as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see people in the pupil.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Judge was born in Trautenau/NordbÃ¶hmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
After four years of high school, he was already interested in teaching.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were deserted.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how it tricked judge into the upper frÃ¤nkische Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the next train station six times a week, by train to Bamberg, where three kilometres across the whole city go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleepover in a red-cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, after three years of teaching, he completed the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "girl room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to the new teacher's house next to the school to a three-room service apartment.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were compiled in today's town hall in Petershausen.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a regrading in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 onwards the children and their teachers were able to acquire the current building, which was expanded after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who, at municipal costs, had a workshop space built and basements built during the expansion of 1997, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"BÃ¼rgermeister GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a statement from a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter changed what he had heard as a young teacher there.
"You have to give the children two: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It's not always going to be possible." Whether he means only his pupils or his own six children, he's not quite clear.
In any case, Richters Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When students were beating themselves, they did not get a penalty job from him or were not given to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves bought and had the two opponents come against each other, even if there was some violet.
For the sake of the school, the judge as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
This prompted the non-party judge, after his retirement, to apply at least as the latter on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Judge was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of rushes made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open air in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radeln and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there they experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which took on 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seim, who was part of the cycle in Bad Vilbel, and the director of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-DÃ¶ring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of the body and mind: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, sweat, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which wonderfully mingled the hardy cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake landwives," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be made at the drink stand of the Gypsy-Nida Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a massage of his partner's head: "He deserved it, and finally he has re-attached already thrown off bicycle chains".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of Reporter Rainer Janke's drinking spa and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also PhD Director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004 as a tour leader, was able to get drunk for a short time, but he had plenty to do with the technology on the spot.
His pick-up truck, in which he communicated three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle team to the police of Hesse, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from GieÃŸen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists have travelled.
The number of participants depends a little on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I, the participants are housed in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival atmosphere and, of course, it had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his capacity as Board member of the ADAC Hesse-ThÃ¼ringen.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was used eagerly despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens were increasingly mixed, who were doing just as well by the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived in Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports HÃ¼rriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her approach as part of the activities directed against him and others in positions of power by the Islamist clergy, Fethulla GÃ¼llen.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held at every school.
Heaven is not everywhere above Ukraine peaceful.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksandan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud charm from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the mother company Pearson's top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their deposit was allegedly almost Â£1 million.
Their political ranking is also sound.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, former president of BP, David Cameron, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwards on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But which new president would risk taking up everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might be doing his job himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is drawing closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of Â£145.50 per year, the British public buys themselves into the surely largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 Pence per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my mobile these days and see missed programs later on on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that descending Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a demeaning comment on the democratic district attorney who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that quits the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and I deleted it," it was said in the later message.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry lodged a veto against financial support from her office when she refused to withdraw, leading to an accusation against Perry, who might be a presidential candidate in 2016, before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet reads: "I don't always go drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I appeal to Governor Perry when he chats it out."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers asked the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the charge and argued that the law, which is being used against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas, is incontrovertible.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and is determined in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This veto ensured a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in his 2012 presidential candidacy at the election meetings in Iowa, Perry went on speculation that he would stop by posting a Tweet of a photo of himself joging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley again declares housing market "normal"
One of London's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in South East England was "returned" to a normal level.
Homesteads in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set maximum limits on mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal level of transaction since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment for action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Catasteramt, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about one fifth last year and were around Â£423,000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "violence tax" before the general elections next May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tighter lending schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now dropped by a quarter a year, says broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for fixed-term sales amount to more than Â£2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and the result has also remained stable as a result of fixed-term sales."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes that year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to Â£ 280 million per year, turnover by 18 percent to Â£ 1.6 billion per year.
In a announcement on Monday before the Company's Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual taxable profit accordingly at Â£450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at Â£23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Nacktfotos by Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nacktfotos of Oscar award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "explaining violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly created by a gap in the iCloud online storage system of Apple. The alleged "masterlist" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are watching photos taken by my husband and I in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're really happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the "iCarly" and "Victorious" Nickolodeon series disagrees that in the photos it is about pictures of it and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FREE, people.
Let us defend the beginnings of the game. *Ortspiel intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande quits the authenticity of her alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel on love and the letters "J".
They were broken, so you could best describe it, they slowly disbanded like a cardboard that you let stand in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, stressful, intense, remote, and maybe a little scratchy.
Then shook his hand.
He knew that scratch brush.
He was sloppy, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this rigidity was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shaking delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, there were spiders in the baths, necks had left their tracks on all the windows and believed they were all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairytale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat on the broken deck chairs in the high grass with Ailinn holding hands and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded out in the service console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, to whom his father had gladly shouted at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolested, just as the word obsoles.
The general taste created what decrees and prescriptions would never have been achieved, and how people choose from books the From-Teller Washer-to-Millionary Memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, they chose the ballads in music.
Kevern began playing an imaginary piano in the euphoria of the day and singing great feet in a grossly comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he got out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a Penny.
It had not been a very funny game since then, and it was also not very funny now.
He knew that he expected this, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly prohibited.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was room for only one "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end up.
It's the same as the mind.
Its unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society, thankfully, agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were like nature blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the drainage; what was left of the Greeks, broke plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WAS WHERE IT WAS WHERE IT WAS WHERE it happened - for fear of being accused of burning fire, for fear even that the flames would consume them next - had opened labneh and shisha-peifen restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
As she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just spoken to her could ever be represented.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why should your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in their presence.
She already thought he was something special.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelieving and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her untamed black raven hair.
There was nothing else he would have liked to see.
"If you say so," they say without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're telling me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at me again.
Your feet aren't exactly like that.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed to put on the jokes of inherent cruelty.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her lounge chair, threw the console over and poured out the wine they drank.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to tremble, like palm reed in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel drawn to you perversely," she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She grieved for the unnecessary unkindness of his words, as well as the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more deadly according to WHAT WAS WAR had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch out!
They first knead - knead was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the indescribable love ballads from the console - they first knead and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knotting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the strength of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave himself - as if from a room on the upper floor her companion was looking at him - a man complaining about something he himself had sworn up.
Adam's leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was this a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
A number of years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, worked on a short talk about continued low- and medium-level violence in precisely the areas where their reduction, if not abolition, was most expected, given the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been rarely felt historically despite the highly challenging church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates themselves with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former brutality holds the rural communities together with our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and backward struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme nut tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme answered Nutbaum.
Are you gay?
Once again Esme relied on her right to privacy and to deny the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job without prejudice.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "intense" and "roh" could be interpreted by others just as well as the expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride around, WHAT IT IS, WHO IT IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the land its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED spell in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or more.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of here," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior had talked to her at the end, "and I'm not saying anything but that we're not as well healed yet as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in it, as we repeat the mistakes that were made only to the WHAT IT IS, WHO IT IS.
But this time it is not the others we leave out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when they say that they would have left out their "worship" and their "distrust" of "others".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about "us" and "others" when we understand the past as well as when protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From him, if we are honest with ourselves," dared to cast an essay, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened happened happened happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing to be said - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be attributed, no debt has to be cleared if such a cancellation is appropriate and if there is a way to clear it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget about them.
If I may say something about this,
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll think of her report," he said and dismissed.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by, had driven on the foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he had reported threats of attack.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics" who were armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after having received several secret service reports that inside the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just ahead of it to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even though no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'Ã©tat," he said.
Speakers of the military in Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers would retreat to their barracks and the situation in the capital would be quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he has become a target.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations despite.
Eurozone production on a 13-month low
The growth in euro-zone production slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a carefully observed study.
The final Markit Shopping Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breaks in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect from the Bank a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the euro area as well as for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide more information this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative simplification for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers have become evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to trigger the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the purchasing manager index of manufacturing in the Eurozone from August is that after that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Evidently, producers in the euro area are finding their lives rather difficult at the present time, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably results in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it is becoming "more and more likely" that the ECB must eventually initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children tricked in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrendous siege of the Beslan School, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in horror, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war which now haunts Ukraine - and in which children like them die - will now come to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried to climb back to the broken school sports hall in her underwear after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," said Aida back then.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put her in safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated on again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as they were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says campaigningly.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to this kind of thing not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (russes go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was gonna die.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby on the way, caught it by the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in the arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on their part, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said: "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that in my memory it's going to fade.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry about all those suffering from the horrors," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir liked to eat Borschsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are just like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and this is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remind himself of it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered below - I remember him laying down on the couch sometimes, turning our faces off for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember walking away from him, "Damir, run away," but I was so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstreamed face was marked by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried off to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days keep following me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school that day so much, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the library.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friend's tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijev was caught during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gymnasium and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence officer, but he could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not right.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return to that place again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the doctors, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and of course they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgij won't go.
It's got to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept this if something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can run, but he can't play sports.
I would say he overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could make to me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are still killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby so taken by a special deployment command was carried in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not recall at all the crueltys
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian police officer from the Beslan siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar stayed back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mess.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, who he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos underwater, there are a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are worth about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Also insert your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have stage and recording modes to optimize exposure time for the temperate underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to see what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our buyers and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to be closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthetic consultant, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to the diagnosis and disease, while the treated ones are mostly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and unsettled.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray study were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast coat, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once recognized as a "wonder material" but now considered fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily committed itself to not using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, room workers and shipyard workers for example.
As an industrial hazard from another era, it does not seem to be a cause for concern today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual rates of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of Mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma does not know any class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
Indeed, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was training for six years." he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and porters use the tunnels.
You wonder how many my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partially this question.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been ill with mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010 "I am the last person to live."
How many of us are still going to get sick?
Mesothelioma was diagnosed with Andrew Lawson at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomas die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still suffer?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to fall, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die in this way.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has already been spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them at the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "if I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought I'd be affected by this.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with potential deaths.
However, it is more dangerous to have brown asbestos (Amosite) and blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rate."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the subjects, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or in the house was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unconsciously exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be upset by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of this House are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the director of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now uncontested that Â£1 billion of work has to be spent for several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never exactly determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general medical practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45, and was conducting surgery just late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had a shake-frozen.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the scalp, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and started Pleuracatheter in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to practice with Abbotts with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not link this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast coat.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry so much at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week before, "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan-sisters, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestosolations in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (like Graham Abbott often did), most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still going away today.
Students put their bunker burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Also schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have deposited their bunker burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And so innocent objects in our homes, such as flooring or sliding roofs, have by default contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's contained in most of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
How countless patients before him he remembered how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take it all in," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long do I still have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life- support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is agitated and the fibers are inhaled, they can be fixed in the nipple, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the scalp and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work very well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the nipple," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer speaks "not very well on chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counselling office for those affected.
"Hello, cancer center," he said with joy when he called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and would probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred back, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But if these treatments ultimately fail inevitably, many of the people concerned are concerned by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
So they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the neglect of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually contributed to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation," since Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has established a Â£350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have agreed to in a normal damages process - about Â£120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year in the programme.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma patients, that Â£350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not passed and Mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that there was a need for rapid action in the face of seven deaths every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Law in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected a positive effect.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that makes you move on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went on surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't be old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very cosy and rude.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelio branded people, such conversations have not been through by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (and finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists were planning and mobilizing to do so within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
People lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vizegeneral Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its inhabitants elected the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong's citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains its conduct through a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicist protests have taken place in Hong Kong for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement has reached a new level of civil disobedience and they are planning to protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organisers announced that the movement "only considered the occupation of the Central District as the last means, an action that should take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures, including police forces and barricades, were stepped up.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The migration of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear is growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it threatened the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want any fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people took part - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances are offered with the private plane.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxurious travel service of Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also indicated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to cuddle their belongings in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also announced that despite the study fees of Â£9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis of living costs, as the financial assistance available in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharp increase in bills for the simplest livelihoods, before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving in the student's home.
Feminists criticize racial issues and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
While tensions in the Middle West, however, increased and attracted attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shootings of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Think of Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that there are many people in feminism who talk about white things and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's topics" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lied to and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women fighting for women's electoral rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to use the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
Remembering such things, one with power becomes aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted a decade until white women were organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to custody?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, asking for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender themes are addressed, some of her comments on racial issues in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and black men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-evaluation of the topic as a key issue for women, she had to publish only the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the working visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a aftermath in women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for Â£120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which also belonged to a pig that had slept his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo has been published mistakenly and has now been removed," said one speaker of the company.
In the exposÃ© of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest to the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery winnings
One of Harvey's lottery players this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a Harvey newspaper skier moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said that the profit provided for conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a win could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few lucky weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had won only a few weeks earlier the $7.5 million mega-win.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only did the gladiators stand kneeling deep in the matsch at the first Rheinbach RÃ¶mertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and left themselves in the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the times of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat team from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and competent presenter and sent his men in the ring to be a heroic two-game in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were in the line with rectangles and short-heavy as well as leg rails on the left leg and arm rails on the right arm.
The "Esedarii" was followed by a chest plate, short-heavy and pelvis, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which came against the "Secutor" with a throw net, a trident and a dolch, and which recently hit the boys to the ground.
Since the swords hit each other in a metallic way, the shields created and the litters flew over the arena that a fear and a faggot could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on that the imposing "summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Freundeskreis RÃ¶merkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the leisure park became a "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, for example "Aqueduct marble" of the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The frontinus society once and now faced the supply of water and energy, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time today".
This is also confirmed by the diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as chorobat, Groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypokauste, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Soil Monument Care at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
A conversion wall of an economic building with a tarre had been found for drying cereals and milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland at that time, suspect Morscheiser.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's windmill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on waxboards as they once did the Roman students.
At the stand of the Roman thermal bath ZÃ¼lpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a wafer bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman passenger car, which was faithfully remodeled by two cold flowers, visitors drove through the leisure park and also passed the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Roman project weeks".
With a week of Romans from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Roman year, proclaimed throughout the Rhine, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the forthcoming Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of "Germans" from Wachtberg and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible at first sight, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-exploited.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation of the find of the Berkum Matron sanctuary will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic affects West Africaâ€™s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go on a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots on the fields that mines are abandoned and markets are ruined - the virus has hard to add to the region.
Some international companies are already going to a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, it is also an economic one," said Donald Kaberuka, head of African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, selling clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola will enter the market.
Liberia was the hardest hit by the virus, and more than 600 people were killed by the fever alone.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, and thousands more died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: only a few merchants leave their hometowns to get after-sales.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Foods are scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, for example, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic food such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region which is heavily dependent on international companies is threatening image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugo of the French Think Tank Iris.
The determining factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugo.
The disease also affects the stressed national budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already severed national budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely affected by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in southern Niger has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere many people remain home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Gunners celebrate their 50th anniversary
The SchÃ¼tzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50th founding festival run from 12th to 14th September at SchÃ¼tzenverein Tannenwald.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., the big BÃ¶ller shoots.
Then there is the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam" in the big tent of the mood.
Blaccapelle provides for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large festival at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the distribution of prices of German and Gaussing.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their dindln.
The permanent chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert FÃ¼racker took over the patronage.
The original name "SchÃ¼tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on March 21st for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room-studzen and small caliber shooting".
The NS-regime had led to the dissolution of the club in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men again find themselves, who raised the "new" SchÃ¼tzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30th in the guest house Lukas.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult beginning time, in which it was primarily about finding a club place and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965 the SchÃ¼tzenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records plowed every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" association's premises no longer met the demands of a modern Schutzenverein, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, parish priest Strasser gave the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th GaussieÃŸen, connected with the solemn dedication of the new gunner in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A BÃ¶ller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶llerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian BÃ¶ller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteering, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought the latest technology.
Elf Teams in round-wet fights
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schutzenverein.
All in all, eleven teams are currently participating in the round-wet fights: six Air Force Teams, one Air Gun Team, one Sports Gun KK1, one Youth and two AH Teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the SchÃ¼tzengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has ascended from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as Bockstechen, carnival and king's ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also at the parties in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers from an accident on return to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said that his 14-person team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hoping we can make it better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "it just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped off three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the track during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start to 12th position, Stewart was already in the first 10 ahead and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Busch got hit
Cars with no. 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but returned to place 21.
Young people looking for a dance enthusiast
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to contesting.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn also create the whole day classes at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have decimated strongly.
Now, more and more young people are being sought for a healthy sport that is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", only nine children are left.
"Three in the group of the eight to twelve years old, six in the group of the twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can go in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, FreistraÃŸe 9, without obligation into the training hours on Thursdays between 5am and 6pm or Fridays between 5pm and 6.30pm.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore and classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the sociability does not get too short.
"We also go to eat, watch dance films, and we've spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance isn't like that, it can also snap into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can go into classes in the fields of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, videoclip dancing and hip-hop in the classes every Wednesday.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who has a desire for Discofox, Slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may look past and join.
Bulgarian Prisoners Protest Nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General informed BNR of the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
The pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise in the East Rhine.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanks were allegedly also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian Separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in fighting in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies, the insurgents reported on Monday.
Coastguard vessels sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, one speaker in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media held Russia responsible for the incident.
The Separatists also reported having controlled several villages in the Donetsk area.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a ambassador of the Separatists from the East should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the Ukraine crisis due to planned deployments in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is in line with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a broken break" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Russian documents and statements point to "that they regard us as an opponent".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary", Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow meet for new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union to send a representative to the talks as well.
Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over the price of gas.
Last time, EU Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply to Europe.
Europe receives around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor makes a clear confession to this.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has been persistently alarmed by the CDU against the car tolls.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word after persistent resistance from her CDU for the introduction of a car toll.
"To make it quite clear: she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU committees in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not stick to a detailed model for the time being.
The black-red government programme refers to "certain parameters".
The Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and it will now be further worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that the Minister of Finance Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) was also involved in the discussions on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about further ways of activating more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as the expansion of broadband.
"There's nothing special about it." SchÃ¤uble had left an uncommented "mirror" report on Sunday, his house tested its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll intakes - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to toll all the federal and district roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU President.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism of the CDU.
The left considers the plans to be failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners must not be taxed in addition.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
The model must not, however, penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Britishman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe movement and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from peace ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other children roller shoe or skateboard and was often held in school because of my way of walking and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in between, I'd slowly lose all my abilities.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She told her when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has worked as a fireworks worker since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, the former military training site in Munich has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition appears every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be sprinkled on the spot.
A deafening bang can be heard during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the military training site of MÃ¼nsingen, which was closed after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
Restoring the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion in government and local offices in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over revenues of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The company's government and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of falling decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in company real estate values, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as here property taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not increase evenly in all three places.
The growth rate in the district was 4.3 percent, the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has at 6 percent in all three branches the significantly lowest corporate income tax rates (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and, overall, there is a better tax environment than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to up to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be better off paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure that most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than the total corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are expected to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could fall behind if the Federal Government's spending cut had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes to have a brewery and also hopes to have a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle down in our city," said Li Yiwei, Vice-Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, during this week's visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back again and again on this issue of the twelve-million-metropoles.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, threw Li.
Therefore, people also possessed the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated Mr. Li, flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou arrived with shepherd-gumbels - but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity order.
More Business
A second request of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Manager Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but dropped it for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities is constantly increasing".
At the moment, travellers had to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The Guangdong Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, also expects the airline to operate.
The provincial vice-governor, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded.
A well-kept partnership
The almighty vice-president of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend a partnership meeting in Frankfurt next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been transported out of office because of allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a countrywide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced by head of state Xi Jinping with hardship.
The new leading politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000 kilometers away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong with its economic power as Hesse.
Next year she wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter showed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a message today.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a heart attack at a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and closely observed until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
There is also more money for the builders: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros across the country.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - bought the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected Twitch to take over, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was decided for a cool billionth thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their favorite pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely the case that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was recorded somewhat boringly, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not possible, as the company reported that it was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, Twitch's incredible success.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer sports rather than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attraction of seeing others while playing instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over your shoulder at 3 in the morning by a friend while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something quite different to look at a spinner as he gets shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty's head.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the view without your own control can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronic age perform in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video that YouTube Twitch could simply swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being promoted.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Burggartenfest at HÃ¼pfburg on Sunday night.
The organisers' concept was correct.
Despite the strong raincast on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
The intake had to be stopped temporarily.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Of two Spanish words, Maxim Sakraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from itself anyway.
This was shown early on Sunday evening when the first visitors went up to open air.
A feast for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they did it.
Around the supply facilities on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were encouraged.
And that across the generations.
While the one on the ceiling lulled on the extra-cartted white sand at the beach bar, the other one at a quarter of the wine in the vinothek, the young generation on the hill castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests, fell.
But even in children's make-up, the volunteers, in the truest sense of the word, had to do all their hands to become master of the Andrang and to enchant imaginary creations in the small faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the goodfoot crew set out in salt weeds.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he fell down on the visitors, especially families sought the breadth and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there will be no opposition to a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the people's voice.
As annoyed, he said that, in the meantime, the intake had to be stopped.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too little strength.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumped in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound engineering.
The salt reeds hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire belt.
"But in the next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than a success.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still have to be deleted at the first time, but at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers must be critical.
"Sorry, but you have just expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some people don't just Quatsche stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Take care!", says Stephanie JenÃŸ to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to put aside these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wartberg's landmark shrinks
This is not as expected.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 metres than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The final step to completing the new case is the change of cap
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is put on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant at the Ice Bucket-Challenge sinks jaws
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket-Challenge went off painfully.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket-Challenge that she excavated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom circulated so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing it, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work, the jaw was skinned, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and sister also saw this and almost made themselves in their pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was sent to the hospital in order to get back in the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgverein soon to move back on a line?
Last time there was always a dispute between the two Wolfrathauser Burgverein.
Now the executives are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfrathauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfrathauser Burgfreunde, led the project in French GuÃ©delon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfrathausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and with a possible reconstruction seemed very different so far.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach are soon to be held.
This is confirmed by Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we be able to join together once," says SjÃ¶berg.
In his view, all members of both associations could come back in line in the future.
Thus visible successes can be seen faster.
While the Burgfreunde had in mind the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until the last time a reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront for the Burgverein um SjÃ¶berg.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has stood before the Burgfreunde.
A new chairman will be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "think phase" was necessary in order to "conceit how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president should then go to the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, Burgfreunde could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to apply because he has his place of residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a Wolfrathauser.
The TÃ¶lzer wants to work on the project "but very much likes to continue".
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
They are a tourist magnet because of the high participation of the population as well as voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical in the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward." It could be created a "all-in-one feature" for the FlÃ¶ÃŸerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I do not personally want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving at this point.
Their goal to document the story at first is "important and good".
After that, you could see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast two semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for higher semester students' books and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chic-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who visited Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The College Executive announced that students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Rental of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented at college bookshops last spring, Neebos Vice President Teva Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is required to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous expenses are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books by eBay Inc.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth thinking about if you treat them somewhat well, think about giving them back and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business at which you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, submissions or signs of use.
Renters beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be visiting Pepperdine Law School shortly, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order is made, you should check whether the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" recorded less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape" cut on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's movies like "Drachenzamen leichtgehÃ¤mmen 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children's films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
So far, Collins described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachen teeth made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
In the case of films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for each summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 screens between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the year before.
The results are based on the views of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash flow from Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated sales of 1.2 billion dollars in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which revenues amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and predicting a "smelling" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the expected potential cashier in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other film industry representatives are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema store at all, and no one will worry about business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis class was removed for the purpose of streamlining the league classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence: Whoever did not ascend has descended.
As a result, GÃ¶ttingen's top-ranking team, Torpedo, has avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
In the fourth class, torpedoes women remain, despite their magnificent walk through the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves are entering the new Verbandsliga, in which the Landesliga are no longer represented in GÃ¶ttingen clubs.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-Zweit in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district Oberliga SÃ¼d.
TSV Seulingen, VfB LÃ¶dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC are entering.
In the district league, as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies begins at least in order strength.
GÃ¼ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the lot.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen are starting in the district league.
With each of nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Even the district liga-spaffel of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mienhausen and SG Lengler II.
Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East-Staffel.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women's teams at the circuit level.
Noting that none of the six 2nd cycle classes achieves the strength of determination, here the innovative and busy circuit board will have to think before.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
In the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the local city hall to hold a so - called counter summit.
Stephen Faircrough has been following developments for us this weekend and talking to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bushwanders were secured with the winch of the rope after they were caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday morning in Govetts Leap in Blackheat.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and opened his head.
The rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
Some 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half an hour, the transmitter resumed its broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with poles would have damaged devices in the editor's office.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government to whom they are denouncing election fraud.
The police reported that, on Monday, approximately one kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been clashes with security forces by some 3000 demonstrators.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed during the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to move on to Sharif's residence.
They call for the Prime Minister's resignation.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and to apply no violence".
It was also stated in the communication: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for military intervention, which in the past has been more frequent.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan proposes that Sharif have won the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call out new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
The protesters had at first remained peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on weekend to move on to Sharif's residence.
HÃ¼tteldorfer after the second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over GrÃ¶dig, Rapid took a bitter week on Sunday with a consoling end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the Out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed the captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who made his three strides with Green-White.
Schrammel-Traumtor takes Rapid to SiegerstraÃŸe Rapid has shown with the second season victory the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience into the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outdoor defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership fulley from the sixteenth corner, set the course for victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd get all the frustration from Thursday and cut it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid Youth," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his job very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrored.
He earned the gate, he already made some assists this year," Barisic praised.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after good an hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have written down before that.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Schrammel, who pointed to the gap between performance and results in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that one had "been better in many games before today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact to the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less gratifying: "That we finally played too much again".
A lot of work during a national game break Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have made their debut debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," said Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the last three days, "who have been very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and put a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks.
One to whom the break seems to be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he showed that he is a very important player for us," Barisic stated.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before its change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 about the Admiral).
Hofmann: "Can't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had a bit of luck, but someday the luck has to come back to us too.
It was high time now," said Hofmann.
He warned, of course, to focus on further work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad as this has been shown in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is right now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It's a very young team I can help at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
GrÃ¶dig-Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid hit "out of the category Zaubertor", as well as the regular goal of exploitation in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly cleared by the arbitrator colleague.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the gate in some phases.
We've had too few closures.
Internal defenseman Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started bad, but then we found it clean and even made a gate.
On the whole, it would have been more in it.
Under this Wifle Rules Ruh
We showed a powerful tribe during our rÃ¤tselaufgabe of the summer series "My piece of the RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the pictured copy is the "GeiÃŸruheiche" above UnterweiÃŸenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes by domes, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with an area of more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Episcopal Archive and asked elderly people from Unterweisenbrunn to find out what their relationship with the GeiÃŸruheiche has with the GeiÃŸruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were supposed to have driven their animals from underwhite fountain to the laboriously-roasted and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree shall the animal guards exhausted from the ascent have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, for on the meadows actually pasture goats.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further explored.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for cross-parents.
A hiking trail leads from UnterweiÃŸenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Other paths are marked, the direction Hochrhoen ascends and invites you to an extended hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
A water castle, however, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare to find at the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but in the district we have some historical buildings to which the building might fit.
Where is our "StÃ¼ck vom RhÃ¶ner HlÃ¼ck"?

After a week of change, Italy's prime minister and senior EU President, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU's special summit last week.
Renzi considers, as reflected in the government-wide daily La Repubblica, the appointment of his Mogherini as a favourite in the government team to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to put the left-wing party base which he wants to face up to him again and again, because Mogherini is assigned to him - albeit in a moderate way.
Compared to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome in order to produce a political balance.
The EU's chief diploma is also a deputy to President Juncker.
The outstanding agreement of the EU Parliament is considered to be certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades Mogherini, known for its ambition, has been proven in leading party offices.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her career began with the graduate politician in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democrati di Sinistra (left democrats), who joined forces with the Catholic centre party Margherita in 2008 to form today's Social-Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With her election to the Left Democratic Party Council in 2001, she entered the high political party, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose director she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a share in it, as is noted in PD meetings.
The discussions in Brussels, which the new EU External Representative has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lack substance, are taken into consideration in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltics, most people are being persecuted by arbitrarily realistic accent on the crisis in Ukraine and defame it as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe in the vicinity of Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hand were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for October to a Milanese economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas BÃ¼gel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg affort Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all grades as well as the instructors will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees worldwide and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "hold their mouths and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deep-seated left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has encountered disapproval by the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain with him," he said with great applause.
As a troubling gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government will not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had called on his fellow socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, put sand on the ground, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant digging struggles and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one didn't even survive a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a resolution of Parliament and said she was confident that she would be a winner in advance elections and would be ready for the government.
The ruling French party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Sunday found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would lose patience quickly if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record jobless numbers.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a Prestige Cruise deal of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships as well as their wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) private equity company, also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to any comments, while a speaker refused a comment for Apollo.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion, and in the coming years it will be expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities for the stock exchange in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly have 82 percent of American cruise ship passenger capacity, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-like group swung near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to assert their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial square with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leadership fears that the calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China's predominance over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Vice Director of Hong Kong and Macau's Office, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of the head office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not have any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "state talks" with the Ostkelraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Russia under the control of the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-Ã -vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents to the Kiev government is, however, consistent with the strategy that it seemed to have followed since the outbreak five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking possession of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossija region actual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state-owned TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to conquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary splendor of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups of civil communities in the territories held by separatists are hoping for early peace talks "are trapped in their illusions," reported Itar Tass.
"We need to start in-depth discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of the South East Rhine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood had to be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can provide the eastern territories with the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The cremator's clarification of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the Separatist rebellion in the East, contrary to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million ethnic Russians are.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the East Rhine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and gave surveys of the time before the conflict a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats in international forums would empower the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries producing important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the launch on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after a new election - should bear in mind the additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the Separatist rebels, whose armament and instigation Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kyiv to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the former peaceful region along the Asov Sea into the ostrich.
Russian-backed separatists took over by hand, which, according to concerns of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for actions to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donezk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said on Saturday in Kiev.
On Sunday, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged for 10 Russian parachute hunters captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Nacktfotoskandal around Australian Promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't holler at his anger about hackers who probably stole naked pictures of his fiancÃ© Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-promise from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around promises on the Internet.
The hacker is probably equipped with 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Among Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Greeko from Melbourne, private photos were reportedly also made public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The most noble who had engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
According to reports from a news site, Greeko, currently in New York, said that the hack was "damaging" and that the affected people felt "damaged".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It's a terrible violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: " posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
The dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated by law.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer attended the 8th wheel on the GroÃŸer Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torturing for one, was an easy training for the other.
But everyone agreed in one: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel Brauhaus yesterday drove the bike to Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle cat, especially since the participation on the 8th wheel on the GroÃŸer Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now I can do this - fine!"
Little peek on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been like...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel City Parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early tau to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cross the 11-kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dietsner, for example.
At the start, the green politician from the circle day - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then turned out to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, the press spokesman for the city of Oberursel, who had made his way together with Frank GrÃ¼neisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to participate - we would have made an exit today," says Kuhn.
On their way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had descended to Oberursel in the morning, in order to retrench the height immediately thereafter.
In the morning at 9 a.m., the Frankfurt Florian Zierz had waved into the saddle at home, "doing" the Feldberg twice, then to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Fridge Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are just included.
He had scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious race biker".
He must be, too, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", which are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the top, but also a Jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind on a cord, proved that it was also easy to get up without a bike.
The mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." Thus, the man is his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent to groups on the track in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den GroÃŸen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that he will be able to lock the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
