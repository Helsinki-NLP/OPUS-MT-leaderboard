The main task of the kings was to build a tomb, of which it was thought that it would seem as timeless as the stars above the sand of the time, in which everything else was lost. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember gloriously on the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were chiseled. Certainly, much was sunk, and in the latter time even battles were presented that had not even taken place.
