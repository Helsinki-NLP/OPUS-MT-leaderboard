Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, be diagnosed as a mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject, "Man should have a right to his own body."
Ten patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Art Academy Project room gallery.
Each one of them reads the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and this identity.
He's decided who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person my current treatment history to make the process's violence visible," Auer says.
At the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of years involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process is launched by sending to diagnostics of "sexual identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For the sun, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the oestrogen that he had ordered on the Internet and was, by the way, very long in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, the person had to go through the correction process so that the gender could also be legally corrected.
Translaw, the law on the confirmation of transsexual sex (563/2002) obliges transgender people to be forced into sterilization in order to obtain the right gender, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
At present, every sex remedy is required for psychiatric diagnosis and for evidence of in reproduction.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Translay renewal has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law, and in the European Court of Justice there is a preliminary decision requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right of self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change to the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovisen.
The elections were held and the Finnish people rose to the government.
Now the change of law is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes which are not even related to this law.
"The administration does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government regarding the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Finnish branch of Amnesty.
The front parts of the exhibition space control two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolious psychology of Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
On two occasions, the psychologist met with Mr Auer and wrote a report on the basis of which he should define the treatment of Auer’s justice and help.
The consciousness of the researching reality appears to be exposed to shattering.
The study’s perception of itself appears to be fragmented at the borderline level and the unstable features associated with personality are highlighted.
The Sun did not recognize itself from these pictures.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the Transpoli waiting room into the TV division.
Later on, a piece of art was created on that television called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is born as a woman can increase his chest, but to remove breasts you need a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than at birth the number of your defined sex.
Unfortunately, the experience of the Sun is not the only one.
For many, the process of sexual correction is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passage meets dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and are entitled to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied care, arguing that their resources are not sufficient," Auer says.
Many applicants have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying.
On these grounds, the nursing staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Prohibiting treatment and assistance can lead to an even worse situation for people than before the start of the process," says Auer.
The Sun's own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what it's usually hard for people to melt".
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, feeling relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teens.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit in your own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a fundamental need.
"You have to reason so much by talking, by dressing, by acting and by movement," he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing a vision, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, close comments could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when you get close to being mis-sexed.
"They should know, and they should know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to interiorize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or from body crime, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, no official confirmation can be obtained for one's own sex.
"These studies have no medical basis," Auer says.
And it's true.
In June 2014, for example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An applicant of full age shall make a written application for a new identity code, stating that he or she is of the same sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identity card.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and the Auer exhibition is also crystallized in this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art is still a matter of importance and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organisation provided travel information to Missouri
The National Organisation for African American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a Travel Warning on Missouri, which is responsible for discriminatory practices in the state and for racist attacks there.
"The NACP Travel Information will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and will call on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state that has recently experienced a large number of questionable racial events," notes the organization's press release.
The recent legislation in Missouri hinders the export of cases of discrimination to the courts, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionately directed against minorities, which, according to NAACP, led to the provision of travel warnings.
"The civil rights of human beings are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of the colour of the skin and abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of NAACP’s Missouri, at Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard of one of the many cases before in just as short a time."
Missouri Travel Information is the organization's first warning about the state of the United States.
The organisation mentioned the racist comments presented against African American students at Missouri University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a report by the Ministry of Justice of Missouri that the police are more likely to stop a black driver 75 percent than a white driver.
"The purpose of the mission message is to encourage people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by taking money to pay for guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, a hundred crimes of aggression were recorded in Missouri, which is the 16th largest in the United States.
Travel warning is also the answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies about discrimination in housing and employment relations.
ACLU, a civil rights organisation guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that obliged the police to arrest people for immigration offences.
As a rule, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä requested a report from Finnair on the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (central), Minister for Economic Affairs, responsible for State-owned management, has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension payment received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, Yle says.
According to the minister, it is in contradiction with the state's expression of will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vauramo arose this week when the Helsinki Declaration informed the directors of the stock exchange companies about the development of remuneration.
Finland's Fotografi has news of Vauramo's supplementary retirement in February.
Finnair told us that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has pointed out that additional pensions are not used for remuneration.
The government owns over half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's owner's policy decision.
The sanctions got louder and louder.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting in Hamburg in the G20 meeting of the industrialised countries, seemed to be looking forward to a great deal of work.
Since then, the atmosphere has become much colder.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were brutally reacted in Russia.
The most striking answer has so far been heard by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who says that the sanctions signed by Trump mean "fully-measured trade war".
Even if Russian reactions were to dry up only as highlights and excesses of political rhetoric, the fact is that after the month of curvature following the short choice of Trump, the tightening of the United States and Russia is a fact.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass the sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress, however, adopted the law with considerable unanimity, but the adoption of the law by the President was said to be much more difficult.
Trump, therefore, recently criticized the law he signed as "a significant flaw."
It seems that President Trump's sorcery has been the cause, especially of Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own right of authority must have been reprehensible.
As is well known, the United States is investigating the possible interference of Russia in the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign on Russian connections.
The tightening up of the US and Russia is a fact after a short period of curvature.
When the White House staff has changed rapidly and a variety of scandalous turns have been revealed almost daily, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted by the United States under the leadership of the President, but by the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russian relationship is an enmurant one in the United States, then the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region in the Baltic Sea is also intensifying relations.
The EU has clearly raised the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained, at least on its head, united in its Russian policies, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Finland, economic sanctions have been huge.
The impact of the recent U.S. law on sanctions is still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has led to the exclusion of, for example, important liquid natural gas from the US economy.
Trade sanctions are the way in which world politics can prove its worth.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought-out and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is there no more sacred things?
Trump's White House now has a statue of Freedom in its sights
The absence of the statues is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, dropped a statue of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump administration, knew well what was going on in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acostan. The statue of freedom was targeted by Miller's attack on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really appreciate the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruisers and characters imitating the statue of Liberty.
His attack was about the importance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 the statue was added to Emma Lazarus’s foot — 17 years after the statue was completed.
I saw Miller put Acosta: "I don't want to go into history with that in greater detail, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original statue of Liberty."
Miller wasn't wrong by himself, but it's not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are Lazarus's touching words, the only qualities in which the state not only invites immigrants but "the poorest": "Your drawn, your poor, / Your skindled masses yearning to break the free, / The wretched refuses of your teaming shore."
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller did not practice criticism of literature, and he made it clear that the poor are not welcome to Trump's United States.
The importance of the Freedom Bridge is part of a broader political and cultural debate about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’s friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the statue on their feet, and they well knew that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republics with a classic symbol, with the female physique of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: his poem is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the expelled.
Incorporating the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into original.
Rush Limbaugh – the director, who can now be regarded as some sort of predictive of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the statue of Freedom does not present to anyone, but is the early precursor of the neo-Conservatives, which takes the United States to the dark to cover the world: "Lady Liberty is coming up.
He's taking freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Soihtu doesn't show the way to the United States."
Very rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship long and trying after the journey.
He saw it as a protection and a better life from the perspective of people looking for life.
His statue of freedom comforts him by giving hope and by welcoming him.
And Miller and Trump don't want that.
Their flames do not show way but incite the flames of anger, their only source of power.
2017 General Sports MM Competitions: Neil Black Honors Scottish Members of the British National Team
Elidh Doyle remembers the time when only two shots got into the British national team.
Neil Black, the result of the British General Sports Association, says that 16 shooters in the world championships are "a significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for general sports competitions starting in London on Friday.
In Scotland, according to Black, "there is something special going on" which needs to be learned in general British sport.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I discussed with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish General Sports Association believes that it is linked to the activities of the Association,
and the United Kingdom General Sports Association believes that their activities are based on it.
And a regular streetatter thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, there is something quite amazing about it, which is the reason for it."
In London, many skaters compete seriously for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5 000-metre run. Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was amazing," Black says.
"The leaders left the opportunity to be proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where to live and practice.
The words of Elidh had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Elidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400-metre race of the League of Nations, and these are his fifth World Championship. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 shots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years 1983 and 2015.
Over the course of the year, the average runner Laura Muir has been running five records in Britain and two in Europe.
He's competing in London at 1 500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs in London 1500 meters. He too is worth watching: the man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in UK MM competitions and anniversaries games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship contest, when the only scotch in the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the country team says he's "promising pride" that there's so many shots involved, some of which are seriously competing for the finals and medals.
"By the way, access to the Cape is a great honor, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the clubs that got into the country team.
It shows how far we've gone.
They are part of the award-winning athletes who compete for the prize-winners.
Captain's speech?
I thought it was fine.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have our domestic contests.
It is important to enjoy home support and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Prevention of reviewers on Facebook: Do not stand for public office if you cannot stand criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic policies in his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism is annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led foolishly and silently like sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to the governor of Maryland in Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation challenged Hogan's case earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and their attitude was also modest online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many comments.
But it matters.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of the state of democracy.
He's got the second best estimate in a group of 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to hot heat.
He has been a stable leader in the state and he has been firmly committed to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as his main channel of contact with his voters and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy there.
That is why preventing the governor’s Facebook page users is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor’s page is a public and official forum that his staff manage with tax resources.
Hogan's reporter, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's activities in an interview with Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of commenting on the moderating.
However, marking commentators as trolls, slowers or enemies is too easy to solve.
Washington Post interviewed users on Hogan's Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, kind and proper.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Counsel for Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland of Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of Washington Post.
"Neither can I accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered as an organised group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called comments "centered attack" and someone else might call them to promote things that were considered important.
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing the critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
However, it is really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of tying Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users who were prevented by President Trump have sued him for justice.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheriksen, judge of Alexandria, said the Loudoun County government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution by preventing a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association was discussing the use of Twitter and Facebook by the Republican governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At Washington’s time, cheap postal charges had a similar effect to today’s Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers suffocated Washington.
Even then, there were trolls.
The names Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in newspapers in which they called Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was filled with petitions about Jay's agreement, the cooperation, trade and maritime agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer meal of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about ten places, and in addition to online notifications from couples, three of them.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais Finland, but then also from the individual Haapaveti and Seinäjoki, the specialist researcher Marja Isobrusu from Evira tells.
Greenheads have died of a parasite disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a computer called Trichomonas gallinae, an animal of origin.
It has previously been known to hit doves, especially a bottle.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in peippoli.
In 2009, he was very busy.
Then, in the green cap of Finland, the tricomonosis caused a major collapse, after which the stocks of the species have recovered.
There have now been sick green poppies, but at least not on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Master of Science at the University of Helsinki’s Central Natural Sciences Museum (Luomus).
It can be feared that the previous epidemic of green poppies will recur, unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop eating birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the Renaissance Club
Former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field promotion for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East London organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Northern Ireland’s Rafferty led a tournament in the neighbourhood of Archerfield Links before the final tour but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has chosen a new place and serves as the ambassador for the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be full of its splendor," Rafferty says.
"The players will see the field at their best, and it's in a great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's the most zealous ambassador in the game, and he's proud of his records here.
The tournament is a great demonstration for this field."
The Englishman, Eales, defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European tour and the European challenger tour on his 32-year career.
"This really feels like a special occasion," says a Southport player.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament isn't part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we'll always remember."
Gary Orr returns to real life on his own soil. He went on a tour after filling earlier this year in 50 years.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the home is always more meaningful," says Orr, a city in Helenburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The third is followed by Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners.
There are six shots in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmour and Ross Drummond.
The car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK.
Potential indoor air problems of the barracks were detected in the bay
At least for the time being, there are no indoor air problems found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade, which was reported on Thursday.
The indoor air studies will continue.
The investigations began when a man who had interrupted his craftman’s service for health reasons thought that his health was impaired due to the poor indoor air of the barracks.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Pori's Brigadier's Chief of Staff, there have been no problems with the health of other shipowners.
It became apparent that this was an individual case and that other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Each notification is being taken seriously and we wanted to find out this in depth.
At the moment, it is unknown that we have no indoor air problem, Holma says.
The Brigadier's bulletin states that due to the arrival of July, the barracks had to be moved to the barracks, and therefore dust could have increased at an instant.
The air may therefore seem intrusive, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold
Bardina Degei doesn't use her cooking stove.
She only rarely uses a cat's room.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in Indonesia’s restless Papua province. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a battalion – locally “nota” – directly in the fire.
Half an hour later, a barb-burned battalion will be eaten with a tender, unwashed hand.
There are no furniture in Dege’s home. He sits on a muddy painting, where he usually also takes care of his daily tasks, such as washing the nearby swamp in the wet water.
The bucket in the empty room is delivered by the office of the shop.
Degei is the youngest of four wives in her husband's house, and she's not assigned any fields to care for.
Diversity is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed and many drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five nights," says Degei.
This is a rare curfew in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. It was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villagers were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
A local independence movement opposed by the Dutch authorities quickly turned its anger at the Jakarta government, which strictly controls the area and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is remote and a corner. The journey begins on an hour and a half flight from the province’s capital to Jayapura in Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the stomach with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
Around 19,000 inhabitants in the city have wooded houses surrounded by bamboo trees, where the roofs of the waves have dyed rust into yellowish browns.
Only a few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago people worshiped the gods of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," says Degei. "He means a colorful, hand-woven shirt, a dark skirt and a bright-colored blouse.
"Before we had leaves covered with our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and indivisibility are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
The Paniai is about the size of the top area of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometres from the Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most productive gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, which is based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has estimated $78 billion in wood resources.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, for they mean the overwhelming presence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units in 1998-2004. Up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income, and they are ignored without mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed over 500,000 priests and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s were measured by genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 people in the area in peaceful demonstrations.
We Will Lose Everything 2016 report on the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Human Rights Watch researcher.
The grapes have been squeezed as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants in the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the Indonesian people of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes change to the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Jaavian warung-food chefs sell fried chicken and gado-gado blends in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The market for chicken and vegetables has started to be cheaper than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, from Pania, who moved to the provincial capital after work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo – best known as Jokowi – promised to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations in his 2014 election campaign.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former logger won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential castle.
But little has changed with Papua, and locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowia in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our hopes and restore justice," You say.
Pania experienced some kind of wave base only two months after Jokovi's October office.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles.
The scared children told soldiers that they should use driving lights.
Another soldier didn't like the comment. According to local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned with four soldiers.
The reports of the victims and the Witnesses show that drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans — young men and women and children — gathered in the football field before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They were carrying out hunting lines for parties, and they began to perform a waita dance in Papuan Mee Pago, where they danced in the ring and tracked the bird song.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and army buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed, the soldiers in the internal radio system were ordered: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on the TIME magazine's official document, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of Kego Koto, knew the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot to the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"A number of shots were fired at the force."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times.
"I ran to him and made sure it was him," Yohanes told the TIME magazine sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead, and I kissed him."
Papuaan police inspector Yotje Mende told journalists that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papua's police reporter, in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The information on the killing was carried to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims and promised that Papua’s violence would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he will launch reports on human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he began to cancel his speech immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start an investigation with Papua.
"They're going to get everything figured out in court," he told me.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "offences against humanity" in 1999 of the death of more than a thousand people in the bloodless independence vote in East Timor. Wiranto told the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of Pania's victims are distrustful of the claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us he's still alive in fear, even if it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him after helping him bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried," he says.
The amps haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired villagers from the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One died, and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villageers and the head of the construction company, which started when the leader refused to bring the lost man to the hospital.
The man in need of hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Doouw, who had been in the water while fishing on a nearby river.
The hostile villagers showed their opinion at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers were stoned by cops who responded to the warning shots.
According to locals, however, the police force in Indonesia’s semi-military police unit opened fire against the crowd, killing one village man.
"We are terrified, we fear revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Mr Deiyai's Parliament has called for shots of police officers to be held responsible and for the removal of a police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development nourishes dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live on the wheated middle ages of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people through random attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arbitrary imprisonment of thousands of people in Pania in the name of "securitying national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "loyal, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There's only a few rice for sale in the Enaro Valley, and it's too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five battalions.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Ten battalions only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in local and migrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to better local migrants who are educated and more wealthy.
Only a few priests have sufficient capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
"Youth don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Pania Tribal Council.
A remote Papua is left with little attention in the world.
Moreover, restrictions on international news are still tight.
Earlier this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papual even though they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises; he has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by removing restrictions on news.
"Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and the journalists from the West Bank have new risks: visa refusal and blacklisting," Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian government is only putting pressure on the neighboring Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "numerary and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported Papua's liberation movement.
Dr. Arrmanatha Nasir of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want the foreign governments to be missing.
When a Dutch official delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baari visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
In Indonesia, there are presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say that Jokowia is no longer likely to vote.
"Everyone means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Pania shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the Council of Commons.
He wants Jokov to know the situation of the Panadians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in lack and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panies, like the other Papuans, consider Jokowille's "liability" to be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threat and intimidation, the family of the victims of the Pania shooting once again showed a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country of the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget about their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says in the press.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks at the withdrawal of Robert Helenius' replay: "Even fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of the heavy-duty boxing team were scheduled to take part in the May 27 Hartwall arena.
However, the fight was reversed for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora gives the reason for the replay of the game completely to Helenius.
My fight in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Night-Sano in May that the game was moved to autumn.
It's never heard of anything new about the fight.
However, the cancellation will no longer harm Chisora.
In any event, the fight would probably have to be cancelled after Chisora's illness.
Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up to a lot of pain.
My truck was full of explosives.
At the hospital, they said I had to go to surgery, Chisora tells me.
Britti says she is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He doesn't think he's interested in a replay with Helenius, but the target is Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
The fire took over again in Dubai by Torch duplicator
The flames took over the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of people had to flee 337 meters from the 79-storey building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building whose name happens to be Torch, a torch.
The building was cleared, and no one was known to have been injured, because of fire, there was no idea immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up in the noise of the fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue agencies, the fire forces were fired at 4:00 in the morning and left to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building board carried out a study that found that the most damage was caused by the coating and insulation of the facade.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the insulation and cloaking boards of the Grenfell Tower in London could promote the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
The moped was stolen during the night from the parking lot in Joensul.
From Joensul, the parking garage was stolen from the mopo between Tuesday and mid-week at 5 p.m.
The Mopo disappeared from Jinivaara at Tikkamaenum 2.
Mopo was marked by Sky Team Monkey.
In color, it's red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
We found the mopo later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers are taking prohibited items into the plane, revealing a survey
The survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited objects knowingly or unawarely past the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other steel-equipped objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said they only knew afterwards that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers were interviewed by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also show that young passengers are more likely to defy rules.
Of those passengers who were consciously breached by the TSA, 19.7% were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15% were members of the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three per cent of the men were aware of their exports to the aircraft and 2,2 per cent of women and 3,7 per cent of men reported that they were knowingly exporting banned drugs to the aircraft.
The survey was attended by passengers from across the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many smugglers had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also most likely to pass the security check – knowingly or ignorantly.
However, as the company surveyed points out, the TSA’s instructions are rather complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the plane and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that books should not be taken on board.
You can take liquids to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
President Scott Pruitt of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency made his decision to delay Obama's decisions to cut emissions
The day after the 15 states had challenged the law of the CEO of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt, Pruitt withdrew its previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions during Obama’s governance.
According to Pruittian, the change shows that the agency he runs better takes into account the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
Pruitt did not mention, in a word, the action brought against his earlier decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should begin to comply with the 2015 requirement for ozone from 1.10.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move on with the implementation of the decisions by the year so that his agency will have more time to familiarise itself with the plan, because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Following its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision requiring the Director of the EPO to exceed its powers in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies.
In its opinion on Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his full translation of the ozone regime was only a confirmation of the EPO's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPO often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for the activists' groups and others to challenge the right to reach agreement on the timetable," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he challenged the right of the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in the regulation through the trial and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and its powers for us."
However, the opinion of the EPO stated that Pruitt could continue to use its "powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are driving a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
This week, the EPO’s case for the challenge of the federal association led by the state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told us that the group intends to continue the pressure.
"As a result of our claims, the EPO's mental change is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct effects in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the case involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the surface is produced when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil processors and chemical factories react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
As a result, fumes can cause severe breathing problems for vulnerable groups of people, and this is also part of thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make healthy use of the good sense of our breathing air," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We have only yet to fight against Trump's administration, because its ideological aim is to act under the conditions of the polluters and other groups of their own interests."
Supercar manufacturer to become a street designer - "does in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time seeking to retain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the information meeting on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All cases of the same virus type in East Savo
Rantasalmi’s carob strain is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory for Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth strain of octopus in Eastern Savo is the same as that of previous infections.
The THL has ensured that on Friday 28 July, the beach-salmed person confirmed the carob species is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections found in Eastern Sahara relate to the first deer found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't come across any other types of octopus virus.
However, it is possible that new infections can be detected from the fifth of the disease to mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor in basic care for the disease.
There have been no new or suspected carcase infections since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is also important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.
More on the subject: Three new scavengers of scavengers were confirmed in the Pirkanmaa - "Infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland prepares for the work of a lawful shield
Pontika's soup was not even considered to be legalized.
Based on the reason that the process produces, along with the alcohol, methanol, which is toxic.
Next year, it will be legal to manufacture a shield at home, but it will not even be possible to legalise the cooking of the pontice.
The shield is made by means of a lattice, a pontificate again by distilling.
The basis for the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with the alcohol.
There has been no political will to adjust the pontice to the right of every man, Government Council member Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing for the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the pontice was not considered to be legal.
Nor was the matter brought to a political table.
There was no debate about the liberalisation, says Outi Mäkelä (Cot.).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of governments, who took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
Promise the pontice at home for distillation cannot continue to be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain authorised.
Importing tells us that home production of alcoholic beverages is a simple rule: alcohol can be produced by means of home visits.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally scream at your home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and enables the preparation of the shield, Mäkelä to be specified.
The preparation still has to take place in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings resulting from their use are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as you want, and alcohol of your own can be given as a gift.
It must still not be sold.
The act of rivalry is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Importing believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law comes to Parliament as soon as the autumn begins.
The full session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä will be delighted.
Oscar Pistorius was interviewed by armed guards in the hospital
Oscar Pistorius, who had suffered from the chest pains, was interviewed for heart attack suspects in the South African hospital.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers from his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British magazine Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison by armed guards this morning.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
In turn, the Pistori's family's publicist told us that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced six times the Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated phone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The literature on phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders has been leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to end his public speech that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called on Neto to say that this had knocked out the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also issued a first call to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for the literature of Trump.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia must be "punished", "bad" and "stupid", and that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call ever."
Bloodshed in Georgia: Activists re-enact the right to racist lynx in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car bypasses the crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey toward a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are closing the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and pulls through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" man closes.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a reshuffle that was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the shocks of the infection are real when the hangover is thrown into the "Roger" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-engage events in 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan led two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the re-enactment arrangements.
"It's a shame of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Congressman of Georgia.
For him, the re-enactment is an alarming call for action, and it also reminds Monroe's inhabitants that wrong has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice. We want things to finally be settled, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation before we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the dead victim in the bloodshed of Georgia on 27 July 1946.
According to the NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding district were suspected of being shot.
No one was charged with murder, however.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of lynching have always been local knowledge: politics and sex.
In 1946 the blacks of the state of Georgia were given the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court passed its decision in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the election, where a black-collar landlord Roger Malcom stabbed a white-collar landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was reported that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI information, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid the $600 guarantees from Malcolm on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home with Malcolm and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It has become apparent that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, which involved the authorities in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks says it's more central.
"It was a voter's murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reboot of Georgia's bloodshed for almost a decade.
It is a description of the shocking racism that many people would like to believe had already disappeared today in the United States.
The presentation is difficult to look at, but even more difficult to ignore, according to Greene, what is meant.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day, about 30 actors — dozens of black people and about 20 whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been presenting local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and reprehensible.
"I'm gonna feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that history should be kept on this side, so that it never repeats again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene in which Malcolm screams and punches Hester, and he's upset that Hester's had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me?
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then we're going to hit him.
And then all (at least all black actors) will laugh.
Greene laughs harder.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally find it too hard?" he asks.
"Et," Greene's fooling.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--u."
"Yes," the other black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room's power of a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, and they want to honor the memory of those killed.
It's starting from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are out of line.
No one's laughing.
The re-enactment will end quickly and violently.
The sound, the shots — and the silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equal to half black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to watch the performance of Ithaca in New York State, but most of it is local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under the pressure of Brooks in Georgia.
The murders have changed from a story to a story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
The children get to look at artificial blood and unmovable bodies and whisper to each other.
"They haven't really died," a little boy mutates like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who performed the listeners took off their clues and wiped tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a local man who's been acting as Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman involved in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altatta are eager to discuss the presentation with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplins, too, is hard to find words when he describes the feelings of the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible acts that they say and do to people who look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"I've been shown that there's still renditions," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those sitting on the same table.
He's already telling me he started planning the show next year.
"Retaliation is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also a teaching experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
The hanging of plants in shops is sore: the removal of this amount of "excessive parts" really saves you.
Is it permissible to remove the flocculation leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking the pineapple out of the big hat? How much does it weigh?
The answers are strongly divided: one is an indication of its extreme noise, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not being used and which, however, go home to the trash.
I'm sure they'll identify it in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in Helsinki, as many rip off the leaves of the cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the magazines are taken to the biowaste store.
According to the news published by the economic announcements, the gloomy at the green table marvels at merchants.
But how much money will be saved before weighing the extra parts of the vegetables?
How important is the means of snoring?
We women in your teas how the price changes when the pineapple, the art of latvia, the treats, the parsary and the flower salad takes away the leaves or the yarns.
Cauliflower: EUR 2,10 at a price of EUR 1,80, when all leaves were peeled off.
Pineapples: EUR 2.30 for a whole pineapple to be paid fell to EUR 1.95 when its position turned away.
Latva artist: EUR 2.60 came from the price of EUR 2.40 when the short position was removed.
The treats: Two treats cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stocks, it was 60 cents.
Parsakal: The medium-sized parsakal paid 1 euro and without a stock of 80 centimetres.
The end result: If leaves and stocks start to snap off, save a few tens of centimetres at their best for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
These purchases would have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brazilians signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, representatives of Neymar had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a player playing football in the Spanish League.
Huima EUR 222 million is the largest transfer in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogba in France.
The Spanish league blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment by Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the corporation that buys the money cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid a sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa investigates the details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it was providing information on the fee for the European Football Federation Uefalle, in order to enable it to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that the PSG would violate the rules of Uefan's financial fair play.
Uefa can be penalised by a follow-up that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses over three years.
According to Uefan, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its budget.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the economy of the company for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with remarkable sums, Uefa was informed.
The PSG owns Qatar Sports Investment, a State-owned Qatar Sports Investment company.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatarian Nasser al-Chelaifi.
Tenp shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, got burns in the fire from the lightning strike - the stamp was recorded in the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on an aircraft at the International Airport of Lounas-Florida with a couple of workmates when suddenly a lightning struck the plane from the rain sky.
The force of lightning threw a plane into the land near the Dunn River.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said that brother got an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I just asked him if he was alive, Austin's sister says Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the hemorrhage, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard on the whole family.
I don't know how to wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells us.
According to the airport representative, the Salamarisk warning system was on time and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% in response to the pressure on its business.
According to Managing Director John Fallon, employment reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with the previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would again cut costs by GBP 300 million in May as part of its third savings programme aimed at reviving a weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the past year unchanged. Its net sales increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack on the hit in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide strike
The suicide bomber struck a soldier in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, and according to the authorities, NATO’s soldier was killed and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unsubstantiated local information, three civilians also died in the attack on the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday 30 people were killed in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the Thursday evening explosion occurred when the joint NATO/Afghanistan Army patrol was attacked by "carrying a person on an own-made explosive device".
The opinion stated that the situation of all injured persons was stable and that they were treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the reinforcement of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are major concerns for the NATO troops near the Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide strike in Kabul, an area where Shiiamus people mainly live.
The Taliban reported that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May in downtown Kabul, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack, which was the most devastating attack by the country's militant group after the US-led troops invaded the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to the country to help the local army and the police.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPO will reverse its decision to postpone implementation of the smoke regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, has made its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions during Obama's administrative period, the day after 15 states had challenged the Agency's case.
The EPO announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "subscription definitions" in 2015 late on Wednesday. The Agency considers that the decision demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year in October 2018. According to the specifications, the smoke pollution rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where the pollutants need to be reduced in line with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency sued 15 mainly democratic states, including the District of Columbia, which claimed that the suspension of execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump's actions have opposed democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPO website, air breathing with ozone "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the manager of the fathers had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was intended to be taken to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company interrupted prior to the security check.
The police won't tell us more exactly why the company stopped.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic-free gas-discharge device and take it to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phela said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in the police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Managing Director of Nestene: Renewable fuels did well
The oil processor Nestene's result before taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievosen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewables rose to a record level, and the business profit development of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit improved the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievoinen, the operating profit of renewables remained at a high level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
Our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course with the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the 66.7-pound series, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports hall in Los Angeles until the invincible WBC Light Series champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomatchenko, the champion of the WBO's Upper Spring Series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the Showtime by the unanimous decision of the former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, followed by Garcia and Lomatchenko being among the top five on a list comparing the different weight categories.
Garcia stretched her right hand and asked, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with the fight!
Lomatchenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga in ESPN on seven Saturdays.
When the double posed to the photographers, Lomatchenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "complete in terms of tests".
"I'm a former feather serial," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved a series above [63.5 kilos] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small in size, 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the Lighthouse.
He's got to get up in a serie [61,2 kilos] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fill their hopes."
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Celling needs this fight."
The climate asked if the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomatchenko debuted in the lightweight series later this year and will be fighting Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 defeat wins). Garcia would also be interested to see the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be fighting in the light series at the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to take the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We're the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomatchenko as an "unbelievable fighter" and was about to go to the Saturday match.
Lomatchenko interrupted the compliments on Garcia's mountain and said that this three-grade champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed it to knock it out."
Garcia said she focused on showing off the force of the strike and then boxing.
Men said they felt that the fight between them wanted to take place more and more strongly.
"This is the game that is expected.
No other match arouses as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to be able to take the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great match."
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The last time the Helsingin Sanoma told Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisor of the banker spoke full-blown when selling investment products.
At the beginning of next year, the rules on the sale of investment advice and investment products will be tightened up.
The reductions are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no defined skills requirements in the law.
Financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment service employees complete their own APV1 or APV2 exam.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for an APV investment degree company, which is based in the research group Finansivalvonna (Fiva), experts from universities and industry operators.
The degrees are 12-15 credits and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website reports that in general both exams are "very large in relation to requirements".
The study material of the studies includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV-Investigationtukinnot Oy, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either APV1 or APV2 degrees, as they are mandatory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have maped the completion of qualifications, says Savikko.
He says such bankers are "miscellaneous."
According to the report, since 2000, APV1 has completed 13 000 to 14 000 APV2 degrees and some 3 000 APV2 degrees recommended to investment consultants.
Some bankers consider the completion of a qualification to be an advantage.
In many other sectors, there are considerably more stringent skills requirements.
Sofikko says that the Financial Sector Recommendation requires the completion of APV studies, as that is precisely when it ensures investment-related skills.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month, including commissions, personal allowances and income premiums.
The average wage for regular working hours per month is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work in jobs earn over EUR 5 900 per month and women earn over EUR 4 500.
On average, the tenth of those making the most deserve around EUR 8 100.
The tenth of men who make the most money earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, the tenth of women who make the most money earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, the level of employees and tasks has been confident in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit was carried out in response to individual cases where the expertise and competence of the investment advisor was insufficient on the basis of the advice provided.
In principle, investment products can also be sold, even if skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free in particular.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Mr Saviko, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened up with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each undertaking be responsible for the competence of investment services staff.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, has the power to decide what to know.
Fiva’s market supervisor, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes currently required is a regulation on the competence and experience of investment consultants and investment product sellers.
According to the Court, new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of one company.
The board says that according to a proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Five has the authority to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided by these visibles in the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has also been done.
The board specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the employee's job profiles at the individual level.
This will certainly be different depending on whether investment advice or product sales are involved.
According to Hovin, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced on a fixed period of time, if the knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, the rules become more stringent and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

The flight remained within U.S. borders all the time.
It flew a total of 17 states.
Imatran’s persistent beaching schoolchildren do not have a moment of rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen’s swimming pool with the help of the swimming pool
In time, everything was moving forward at a good pace, Taina Wetkonen was with him.
Imatra beaching schools ran in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
While raining again and again, young swimmers are not even moxisks, Tiana Itkonen, the leader of the swimming schools, praises him.
This week's swimming schools have a total of 13 children, and next week they will have a tenth.
The number of children of the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the eskari are already starting, wetkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach School is organised in collaboration with the Sports Association project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Lettee's beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with swimming bags, some already without.
The smaller sisters also enjoyed in the water.
From Allies, 5th thought we'd go deeper into the water first.
However, Taina Wetkonen encouraged her to push her to the beach.
It's gonna be great!
In the summer, everyone told me they've been swimming a lot.
He likes the beach.
In the same way as everyone, the swimming pool was practiced by Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be satisfied with today's achievements, the swimming pool praised.
Jami Kallio, 4th time, he wanted to go to the water war.
Ilona Villberg, a daughter of Anna Villberg, 6 persons on the beach, sees the beach school as a good start for teaching swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes we had to warm up.
Swimming schools packed up on the dock.
The boys had enough trouble with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the dock, sewing the fruit and frying the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the dock.
It's the kind of thing that doesn't belong in the summer.
The unidentified soldier is selling a bunch of toilet rinks, "This is a story that unites us all."
It's all you can see.
A couple of days ago, the Sintulet, which was manufacturing cleaning products, launched a series of unknown military products.
I mean, you know, we're like, you know, we're like, you know, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh, we're like, uh,
In this autumn, the unknown soldier refers to the film and film marketing that he received in his first night.
Yet there is something special in the combination, and the products have been removed in the social media: When will unknown-health links come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of the Sinuisto, say?
We're partners in the film.
We're here to support this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural film," Määtta says.
According to him, the products come from special exhibitions and thus the film becomes visible.
Isn't this something a little funny - often when you think that the products and the related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is the one thing that unites the story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values as those of the old unknown soldier.
Neither is cleaning a foreign army culture, Määtta points out.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichyts have been introduced, named Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products had already been recorded by Finnish photo magazine blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the first night of the film, so there is still a promise.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen have not yet revealed their war products.
New results from the age of asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the medical age trials of the Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 % of the tested persons were identified as over 18 years of age, but not all of them consider the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Medical Agency started testing earlier this year.
Tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker more precisely, and a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for having failed to determine the real age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the Agency has now published 2,481 results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the 80 % tested, in 2002 the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age, and 25 cases were also determined by the Agency that the test was "possibly 18 years or older".
432 cases came to the conclusion that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests were only carried out in cases where the age of the applicant was not known.
Johan Göransson from the judicial office says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform, and there are no large differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that 442 cases had "indications that the subject was 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it became apparent that 243 cases had been openly reported by the applicant to be 18 years of age.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and magnetic images of the knee. Then the dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method is also criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Caribbean Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think the method used is the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't certainly determine age, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of defining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test is almost 18 years old and the risk is about 10 percent."
Joy shattered 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, the five-over-par results spent the 30th place on Mikko Ilose’s final line down in the competition for the European golf tour in Scotland.
The joy left on Saturday at 11th, but was found at the end of the round to be distributed 41.
In a difficult bowl, Joos was accompanied by three bugs with one double-bog.
Others had trouble, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, came up to share the lead with one less than a pair, even though he said that there was enough work to do on the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung with him and finally the day was good, Poulter's thumb.

Governor of Western Virginia to change party
The democratic governor of Western Virginia, Jim Justice, announced the change of party at the Trump campaign on Thursday night.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflection... today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Governor of Democracy."
The audience came up with violent applause.
"To be a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow", Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining company and owned coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an opinion stating that "the exchange of justice is another blow to a democratic party that prefers to build barriers rather than better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Justice announcement is the latest setback for a party with no leadership and unable to find a message that unites people," RNC's representative Ronna McDaniel said in his statement to CBS's news.
The lightnings have sown damage - from Thursday coming up to the very day of the summer
In the final week, more thunderstorms will also be produced in Southern Finland.
During the past week, the central and northern parts of the country and the region of Varsinais-Suomen have been thundering.
On the night between the middle of the week and Thursday, there were several fires in the fire.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become the very day of the summer so far.
Finland has also finally found the ewes.
During the past week, the central and northern parts of the country and the region of Varsinais-Suomen have been enslaved.
On the table, lightning hit the grid with the power center causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received a fire notification about 15 minutes on Wednesday.
The electricity center was located in the sauna at the end of the line.
The rescue facility broke down the roof and wall to find fire spots and quickly shut down the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
Again, the lightning set on the outside of the building in Harjulantie before midnight.
At the time of the rescue, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue agency could not help but prevent the spread of the fire.
An outer building of about 50 square meters burned down to the ground.
In the direction of the Kuopio, in Rääkkylä, the lightning struck the house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a sparkling lightning strike.
The rescue department was here to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire - only a few melts fired.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the track between the Wall River and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The fault was reported between eight and nine Thursday mornings after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be resolved a little before five afternoons.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally on a thunderous track section.
The lightnings have sown destruction throughout Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms of this summer have been quite deadlocks! evaluates the daily friend of the Air Force meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
The mid-week and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small lightning balance in summer, it seems to be even strong for many.
This might seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what it's been compared to the thunder of this summer, says Thomasen.
On Wednesday, the countryside was rocking 1,700 times, and on Thursdays there was the potential for even the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer: by around 4 p.m., there were 1,790 countryside in the placard.
If the lightning continues at the beginning of the night, over two thousand lightning can be reached, The Importer predicts.
The previous record fainting was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, 18,386 lightnings had risen this year.
So there is still something to be said so that this year will not break the two-year-old record.
However, the archdiocese can be expected to continue.
According to the judge, the air above Finland remains warm and humid during the end of the week, which is a birth environment suitable for thunder.
The main weight of Ukku will shift from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central parts of the earth are promised to be more uniform.
That's what Judgine says, it's just that it's a little bit of a thorn.
Coe praises Russia's "open" apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, a global sports company in the world, was very open about her apology, which Russia made for the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end the ban on Russian participation.
Dmitri Shljaht, Director General of the Russian Sports Council at the IAAF Congress on Thursday of the World Cup, said that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he is determined to fight against doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken from in competitions for gold or silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the general sports competitions in November 2015 after evidence of doping in Russia supported by the state had been presented in the World Anti-Doping Agency’s WADA report.
"I think his response today was very straightforward. It was a very open presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The Council and Congress both welcomed the fact that the Russian General Sports Association had admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything it could to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that it is not time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in our power to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the state of the neutral athletes in the MM competitions that started in London on Friday, and have met the IAAF’s strict criteria.
The IAAF working group leader Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient, and trainers who have been banned continue to function freely," he told the journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not come as successful as the authors wanted, says Yle.
If it is said honestly, I am disappointed, admits the director of Helsinki Film who produced the film in the interview with Annika Sucksdorff Yle.
I was afraid that a Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was given its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 viewers, compared to the film budget of around EUR 5 million.
There has not been a lottery win, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small bites of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukuske.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions limiting the use of the money of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Spain to Barcelona in France to Paris Saint-Germain, the most expensive player of all time in football.
On its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will decide on the European Football UEFA, which can prevent the participation of the teams in the esteemed Master's league.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game financial rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in a new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France is linked to a variety of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer fee and joining him in his starcard, as the company will fund the ruling class rich in Qatar's oil.
The companies may use large sums to purchase players, but they need to be balanced with real income sources so that football-related business is not a loss.
The financial rules of the fair game were drawn up by Michel Platinum, a French initiative elected by UEFA as Chairman in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success in debt was deceptive and led to serious problems if banks or owners supported it.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game’s financial rules shifted from crowds’ debts to their monitoring of losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums to buy players and created a global brand.
The current three-year financial assessment period of fair play will last until 2018, with a maximum loss of EUR 30 million.
Despite the fact that Platini had to leave UEFA president’s duties scandalously in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer, also wants to curb the uncontrollable use of funds on the shores.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will apply them in the future as well", Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of fair play at UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymarin out of its contract with a lump sum, it can offset the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
As Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recorded as EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
On the basis of the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were split in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the company was ordered to limit its group of 21 players to the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring crowds that may try to circumvent its financial provisions by increasing revenue through companies associated with the company's owners.
If, for example, a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level on the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid granted by the Qatar Tourist Authority to PSG was superimposed.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be financed through fees available to Qatar for the 2022 Football World Cup organising committee.
However, the PSG and the organising committee have banned Neymar from making the MM Ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA monitors companies more closely around the rules.
On Thursday, sources of information reported that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press Office on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the situation with the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015 to 2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements of the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and to increase sales of follow-up products and playgrounds.
The Board estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30% as a result of the Neymar contract.
Out of the world’s best player’s run, the Spanish League was clearly trying to make the move of Neymar difficult. It was claimed to break the financial rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both society and government," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the paternal ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the government funding the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports ground.
"The battle is the result of a property that has changed the football environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the government owns a football team.
There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now is the rush: Coach of Finnish MM athletes stuck in Helsinki
Long jumpers Arttu Pajulahden and tributary Kristiina Mäkelen coach Sure Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should train for general sports in the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Tomorrow the Pajulahti will compete for a long jump in the curfew and Mäkelä on Saturday for a tributary curfew.
However, a two-way coach, Armenian Ghazarya, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this at the British Embassy.
The coach has the invitation of the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but it has not been valid for a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coach director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters before, but now there is a problem.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter so much.
As soon as someone looked at the steps toward the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the possible absence.
MM-Metal for Finland London takes a miracle
The MM competitions will start in London today on Friday and will last for a fair week at the end of Sunday 13 August.
General sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes will be able to view passionately year after year, whether they came from success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in the medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from honours to honours, where experience will mature the athlete’s performance to the level that the adult MM medal is truly possible.
Now the small MM team in Finland does not have such young athletes, but neither do they have clubs.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It attracts bench athletes to the TV screen and glue to follow races, even though the London medals are solved due to the time difference only late in the evening.
In 2015, Finland won one bronze medal in general sports.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Those who dare to wait for a long time for the medal, even though the results of his last years and of other throwers, as well as the long time remaining, will be cut off in the awards last summer.
In these races, however, the Long Mountain remains in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition or making your own record is a good enough achievement for other Finnish athletes in the race.
Hope and faith in Finland's realistic medal-hunts in the years to come will be a good success for young people in international awards this summer.
The processing of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small group of elite representatives.
Success does not come at a moment’s notice, but requires years of sweaty work for athletes and patience for both coach and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London races will be a history of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, the fear of terrorism or the painful attacks.
First lake Rukajärvi, second in Copper's big air
Snowman Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air competition in the United States of America.
Copper Mountain is the second place in the world's best big air cup in Rukajärvi.
The women's race won U.S. Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried at the last jump in the 1080s for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and good is good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go right.
From now on, I'm going to try again in the races, Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line’s new fast ship landed in Helsinki
The ferry company Viking's new fast ship FSTR is very late.
The fast ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6:00 p.m.
The ship was loading in eight countries.
The ship already came to Helsinki late.
At least for an hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the line is moving a little, the Estonian John Rebane, waiting to enter the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 pm.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical failure.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles in its cars waiting to enter the ship.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that they have become a technical failure.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on 6th Thursday night
42 meters long special transport moves from Moutola to the port during Thursday night.
The transport from nine o'clock should be by noon.
The police control the traffic on the 6th floor, and the traffic may be stopped at times.
The transport is moving along the road 13 to the port of Mustalo.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is haunting both the glorious days of the '80s characters and the '90s grunge' (in those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series of The State Chess series for MTV) and their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things on their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory we have been stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already seems to have lived.
First Day of Camp was surprisingly good and not just because of its absurd humor (including the background story of H. Jon Benjamin speaking in the voice).
At the heart of the joke is that the middle-aged actors are acting on lustful teenagers approaching adulthood, and highlighting it makes it impossible to reach the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys stalkers in the 90's, such as horror movie Hand that swings the grass.
One of the characters in one point is Apple Powerbook, inline roller shutters and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not passed Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And a crazy plot includes Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his criminal partner George H. W. Bush (who plays well Michael Ian Black).
As always in such rows, the best side paths are.
Especially fun is to see the icing of Paul Rudd, who has a party-up under the lower lip, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie Singles. Rudd's play on Andy, the camp's king, is beginning to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may raise this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, the friendly group goes to the first night of the Wet Hot American Summer film.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, calls for a different nostalgia: the spirit of the Cold War series, the Atomic Blonde movie and even the GLOW series, where the east meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Roman-style police drama in the 1980s, where the Bucharestn copman fights for truth, atheism and Marksismi-leniniism.
In the main, we see Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici as a tough-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefina. They are dubaned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But there's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polices spend time watching TV chess the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in a clumsy socialist drama – there is, for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That’s why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not rich enough.
A more dense series could be used as a agiprop satire, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the United States Embassy and the lobby, there are always two fat men with hamburgers.
The message to the supposed communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Roman creators of the series were not wrong: we cast out our own immediate history and their own history.
Kouvolainen Toni Tauru will rise to the ring in Macao on Saturday against a former UFC viewer
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao because last year, the Brazilian Leandro I took part in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world championship of the species.
For once, I fight myself older.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvola was supposed to get up in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made on a quick schedule in the China Autonomous Region of Macao.
The Tauru hasn't met that before.
This was the first time that my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying, because the preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the complainant is pleased to see another time for the fight.
Waiting for a week doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, because it will not improve during the week.
You know, fitness can get worse if you're doing too much training.
In his previous struggle, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are uplifting.
This time the situation is different.
Isa Kouvolaen describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'm guessing he's going to get on hard in the first installment and trying to get to the carpet.
He's won the world championship, so he knows how to push.
The last Japanese match didn't go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon hit the Tauru badly, and the victory was left in the Philippines.
I've never been so very uptight, he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my angle.
It's been a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the freemen fight once a year, some get closer to the circle.
For example, the next opponent Issa took the previous one in September.
Last year, there were three fights.
Now is the second battle of the past year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
In recent years, I've been training and in good condition all the time.
But I've been fighting just for fighting.
When 32-year-old heard of the coming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good workouts when there was a guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, for on Saturday the kouvolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've had the opportunity to train against opponents of the same size and to practice the upright.
Being able to fight is 32-year-old's main tactics.
I have to be sensuous.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the farm myself.
It is not allowed to give sub-swallows free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau is attracting the Tauru that has been taken in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great night ahead.
The central bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 %
The Central Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been unbridled and the slowdown in inflation has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold an increase of between 6 and 2 per cent of the rate of 0.25 per cent.
In its quarterly inflation survey, the Bank decreased its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecast to 1.6% in 2018. It also warned that the level of household income is under increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to increase by close to 3% in autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to curb the rise in inflation in Brexit, and the Bank also announced that it may be necessary to increase loan costs more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that was introduced a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost financing to banks for a total of GBP 15 million, or 115 million.
The Protocol to the Bank's interest rate decision states: "According to the forecast of the Committee responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as real household incomes decline."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for some degree of tightening of the monetary policy in order to contain inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases were "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the Bank forecast an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
Punta declined to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The point of the dollar decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31; the point of the euro decreased by 0.4 per cent and EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after the expected weaker growth rates weakened the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter but to grow slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation survey only gave little hope for accelerating inflation and low wage increases for households, which the Bank claims will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the decline in income in the coming years, but expects wage developments to "remain significant" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will be offset by some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after a fall in interest rates of 0.25 per cent following a shock to the EU's national vote, which hit the GBP fall.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and economy only after four years.
Before the most recent central bank decision, interest rates had begun to demand more and more in response to pressure on households from inflation, and in July the three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate.
Inflation slowed down to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June last month, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will intensify again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2 % target level was exceeded by "total" weak pounds.
"Regarding the recent fall in swap interest rates, competition in the housing loan market would seem to intensify as lenders look for customers and want to make a strong end to the year," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets are looking particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end; the new contracts are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unusable alternatives available."
NHS amounts to 10,000 HIV-disputed drugs
From September, patients may be prescribed a ‘reversible’ anti-HIV medicine. The highest court concluded a dispute concerning the funding of the medicine in the public health system in England (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Before the co-administration, a reduction in the risk of infection has been found by approximately 86% of subjects at high risk.
NHS agreed to finance the trial after the court had held the Supreme Court to be in force last year, which means that NHS can pay for the PrEP drug, even if it claims that the local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the leader of the NHS in England, called the notified decision "a significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to begin receiving registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure contraception (PrEP) should be taken prior to co-administration to reduce the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Before co-administration, the medicine means that during co-administration, the body has sufficient drugs to prevent HIV infection.
You can take a medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target group of treatment includes homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders, as well as people with HIV positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics will choose to test candidates for men, women and transsexuals and those whose HIV-positive partners are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered as a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost GBP 10 million, and the UK NHS signed this week on medicinal products under the contract following the international tender procedure.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and performing the treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance existing, versatile and increasingly effective means to prevent HIV," Stevens says.
"This is another significant achievement in the fight that has been going on for more than 30 years to solve the greatest health challenge facing mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is properly targeted on those in need and at risk, it may have a reversible effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive a drug through an experiment funded by the NHS, which they can decide on independently without having to negotiate with the partner, and it will have an effective effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news."
"Now it is important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no risk group remains outside it," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the trial has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that lasted for no more than several months because of the government's slow down," said Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted."
Quality of living: intermediate and smart interior design solutions have made a small home in Earl's Court's apartment
The former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is the queen Anna's style house on the first floor of Anna's era.
"This is what I used to live with my ex-husband at Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I've been looking for something similar in my price category.
I went to the apartment display and found that the rooms were as high as in my former apartment.
I immediately loved and made an offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 square metres of apartment has undergone a complete change of shape.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the height of the room could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He was hired to work at the Duck & Shed design office in Erfan Azadin Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of nearly four meters high rooms and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it was possible to stand.
The solution required Erfan's creative thinking.
"The structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be arranged overlappingly so that they did not need to be teared.
The structures had to be modified in such a way that the height was just right on top of them as well as below."
Erfan was able to place the space in overlap with two fascinating rooms.
In the middle floor, Retrouvius copper-irrical window opens into an elegant living space.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver stoves and Serge Mouille's vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem more real.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window that opens a view of the other room.
The entrance to the mirrored furniture has storage for Joanne's meals and glassware.
The more stylish it is, the more the kitchen gets hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with a folding door are not a new solution,
But it is unique in Joanne's kitchen that the door is raised in the same way as the door of the garage.
"It required a little planning," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it slips when lifting very easily."
With the sensible use of the space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 additional squares, a second bedroom and an even better basic solution.
"On sale of the property, the area will be determined – or the valuation of the property", Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and lowers the price based on the area of the apartment."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high quality materials that bring the state of luxury.
"The house is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional link to the apartment is partly created on the basis of them," Erfan says.
"No one's attached to the electric wires that go into the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and additional features can make the basic housing exceptionally nice.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Princess Sofia, pregnant, radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's home choice hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden at Båstad the last time before her birth.
A Sustainable Tomorrow dinner for the princess had chosen a fine pink dress.
Sofia represented on the occasion as a smiler.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Swedish Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow in a beautiful blue body-friendly dress, which was beautifully dressed as the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in the dark blue habitat.
This is the last representation event that Sofia represents before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style crowned large earrings and an elegant little bag.
The pastel blue dress was beautiful as a princess.
Sofia has been on a mission to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her living in a little bag.
Sofia just radiated in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even took part in the event to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to her rest of her pregnancy.
He's gonna raise us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, the Lahde Square was where the Thai food was sold.
The Lahti did not dare to taste, they walked past.
On the hook, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentliä, the acquaintances among Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and at that time the Finns did not know much about Thai.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
So he taught the Laity to eat Thai food, a spring roll at once.
Try some, he said.
I got stuck in a hook.
I visited more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai fish in the Lahti shopping hall.
There were two small tables, I think the customer spots were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the venturian.
When hunger and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the stranger.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the board with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by on the side of the store hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the spices made by itself would smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the entrance to the store hall.
There's room.
Now we fans are allowed to sit on our own tables again, only in the most congested times will we be shy to ask the guests if there is any room next door.
The Panja knows his client.
They'll tell him where they've been, where they've been, where they've been to, where they've been to.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customer's stages of life vary and the food company varies.
He remembers what I went to eat with my first spring serpent.
He remembers me weak and fat, and he remembers how young I was.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange the performances at the table with the leaning Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili.
In addition to our tastes, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many talk to him about Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's busy.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to the mushrooms and blackberries.
Last week, the restaurant was a busy celebration of two decades of fulfillment.
We've got our clients for dessert. Strawberry cake.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day was spent at work.
Found 173 Isis terrorists from the underground base who were ready to strike in Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a significant list for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 information from an ISIS fighter who is ready to attack Europe.
According to Die Welt, the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document contains not only their personal data but also photos of each of them.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks backwards.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Special Forces of Iraq found the personal data and images of the terrorists in the course of the investigation of the terrorist organisation's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was afraid that something big and serious would be planned by the terrorists in the West after Daddy fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, the invented subjects as well as information about the person's country of origin.
The list also contains specific areas of terrorism.
For example, for the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list, Abu Assid al-Almani, a German, reads as a battle name.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012 first to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Turkey through Syria to join the Isis.
A special suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There's no more detailed information on the fate of a man.
Some 6,000 fighters have left Europe, and there is no certainty about their fate.
The man fell below the surface in Helsinki Tokoinranta
On the basis of the rescue department interviews, the man wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person who was under water was rescued at Helsinki Tokoinran.
According to the fire master Ville Estoniaer of the Helsinki rescue agency, the situation was quickly over.
The person was found under the water about 15 minutes after the notification.
The diver from the rescue facility found him under the surface, Estoniaer tells us.
The rescue agency received a notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the first aid department.
Estoniaer tells us that he was about 50 years old.
On the basis of the interviews, the man wanted to show us that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinran is already over.
Estonia thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was the mission of the Rajaguard.
The locals also guided the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Raja Guard Department and the police.
Two passenger cars hit nine people in Eura, three seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom had minor injuries, says the fire manager.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at a three - road crossing at the time of four days.
The accident happened when another car turned a warning triangle behind another car, says the firefighter.
According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has an hourly limit of 80 km.
The brothers are fighting for over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria’s largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, which is associated with their Italian family 40 years ago to set up a family business.
The former president of the Carlton Football Society and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live in the Toorak value area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest right to dispute the division of real estate and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the distinction is bitterly contested.
The brothers and their mother Anna own together 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The family began to acquire property when they bought the trade at Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded 160 stores into a chain.
The trade chain was sold with $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in pre-urban areas.
According to the agreement with the late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul approximately one-third of the company’s assets. Paul describes his father as “the driving force and central figure of the family”.
According to the justice record, the distribution of property means that Colin owns properties worth approximately $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"In my opinion, Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first certificate of election in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the highest court following a number of mediation undertakings.
The brothers are also now arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true, and he's blaming Paul for the poor treatment of some properties.
Together, Colin writes of his first voluntary testimony that he would like to reach a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing to me," Colin says in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly growing, with voluntary statements, e-mails and reports on hundreds of pages. The case is being examined by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who founded dairy bars and grocery stores in the late 1950s. At the beginning of the 1970s they bought trade from Brunswick.
They were used as a guarantee for the family to buy a property from Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first grocery store.
Colin tells us that he started a trade "in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the properties to his sons.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of De Lutis Group. Colin said Mark received $10 million and Luke received $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "creepy of their departure from financial terms."
Colin has had a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian Football League Board and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this record of his life in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He told me in his text message that you can't comment correctly because it's being handled in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family to a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want us to argue this way," Colin continued and said she still hoped that the matter would be resolved.
Friday's hope turned out to be out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff will limit the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new White House staff manager intends to limit President Trump's media use and the monitoring of news so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new White House staff manager John F. Kelly met with the management staff on his first working day, he addressed a key problem that he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House workers that all information, whether it be in print or in the press, must be transported through her because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship to television – and as President he still sees a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that compassionate media dealt with things more evenly," said Sam Nunberg, the advisor to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico's editor Tara Palmeri then wrote that "according to the six former campaigners, it is essential for Trump's Twitter usage to have a steady stream of praise for his personal media."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that we others do not know — perhaps the Trump tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left without sending.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent problems caused by him, their work has not been pointless.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trumpi from causing noise.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who try to drive their business by giving Trump information that supports their view. That knowledge can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately gave the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can get so angry at newspaper stores where he is criticized – especially if he is told about harmful leaks of information, then he has to know where the information originated.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone misguidedly gave the President a copy of the GotNews.com website, set up by Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of several White House information leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later. He also did not present concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started the case after reading about Walsh's staff."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of Staff Rob Porter of the White House "had tried to introduce a system of records management for Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more powerful leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving their own things.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, representatives of Neymar had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a player playing football in the Spanish League.
Neymar’s agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved, and he was free to move to the parislisseura PSG.
Huima EUR 222 million is the largest transfer in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogba in France.
The PSG owns Qatar Sports Investment, a State-owned Qatar Sports Investment company.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatarian Nasser al-Chelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen explained alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I am in my life"
From the Tv series, the time of Rose and the pure white sheets of the famous success writer Rajaja Oranen spent just 69 years.
Your hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren keep grandmothers that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now, in the spring, a rental apartment also left.
From the old circles to the light and the sun, Raijan used to take depression and alcoholism from which he survived.
Even the outer being is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were moodkillers.
At that time, alcoholism was helped by hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, a radiant writer says openly.
Raja and Jyrki Orange have travelled the same route for more than 45 years.
I'm better than I've ever been.
Raja and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism sector, have spent more than 40 years together.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen she has always been, stopped her life from that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
What a writer has done Orane remembers only a good 44-part pure white sheets of a TV series that touched and moved the parakeet of Finland.
I finally decided to work for Raika's family company in the clothing industry when I read the 50th interview on Liisa Seppälä's plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing business, and sometimes I act as a mannequin, Orange remembers.
He believed a series of ideas and the story changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelain's research and his argument revealed it, Oranen says.
Rajaja Oranen lives as an active writer, has many manuscripts under work - ideas of hundreds.
The tourers returned to the "millions alley"
The richest houseowners in Western Midlands are once again on their way with the stubborn circulars who managed to cross the edge of the town and return to the next field of the houses.
The circuiters parked their 20 - foot [20] caravans on a street near Solihull, called a millionaire alley.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality had to dig, bringing children, horses, and the army of vans.
The circuiters managed to cross the roadway at a point that had been left unprotected by the path.
Enraged residents have accused Solihull City of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
The unnamed resident tells us that the circulars arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passersby on rocks.
"The time has to be tough to act because it seems completely unable to solve the problem.
They were here in May, then they left, but returned again.
They became more at night and probably more today."
The resident told us that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I'm on Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned as soon as they were driven out.
"There's more to them than before, and they've even dropped a horse to graze in the park."
According to Solihull's local newsman, the municipality is aware of the illegal camp near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the legal measures needed with Solihull's police to evict the camp as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry people circled Portugal’s turret
In Portugal, the men who have been forced into the coast have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
Two men flying on the plane may be charged with murder.
At least it can be sentenced to 16 years in Portugal.
The men's flight of a small plane had to make a technical error yesterday on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the event, some of which were running down the plane into the water.
When the plane landed, it hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was in the back of the plane.
Right after the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who killed her was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents didn't get hurt.
On the beach, they circled a small plane right after the storm, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started to beat it up, reported the case reported in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
Two men on the plane didn't get hurt in a forced landing.
The tragic Finnish star who lost his leg won the gold medal again: "Without an accident I would not be the world champion"
Matti Grand-Hamari celebrates early Wednesday morning in Finland's MM-gold in Canadian Big White's banking slalom competition.
The Grand-Hamari also won the cross-MM gold in the races.
All in all, three MM artists have already accumulated.
It's a pretty incredible MM-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
Two times in gold, quite with a good pulse drawn, the phone-targeted Grand-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the High-Hamari, the number of challengers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralysing has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are diminishing, and there are many new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there'll be a black horse behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
He lost his second foot in the motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to drop down from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get to the slope.
It comes to mind at a time when my life would be what it would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's not necessary to conspire.
The cards play what is divided, the Great-Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to titulate a serious accident and to lose the limb as a lucky kick, and the Great-Hamari does not.
But he turned to the worst of trouble.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Grand-Hamar's biggest boarding was already on its way.
The dune to the top did not go on until after the accident.
When I was a kid, I was working out with my friends, and we were always excited about the X-Games.
But they were far-off dreams that gloated over a period of time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to bitteren and mourn.
I decided to pull the tallars to the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The counter was very pleased with the bicycle chair rider Leo-Pekka Star selection for the year.
Four-time Olympic winner received his prize in the sports game held in January.
The Star victory is an important signal for the para-sports community.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open your eyes to the para-sports world.
Since it's time to launch a double world champion, Matti Grand-Hamar's sportsman campaign?
Then we'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Not all the peaks they desire have yet been conquered by the Great-Hamari.
Next year, the great goal will be achieved.
A year later, the Paralympics will be visited in South Korea.
We're gonna go get a medal!
A majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland unless war ends and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The Syrian refugees are cooking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Daddy from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration will not see any change to the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller explored the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, were interviewed.
Half the interviews were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Of the respondents, 42 per cent may think that they would return to their own country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the closure of youths’ return is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria, as well as by the presence of Daddy in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the permanent return to their homes, whereas in the quarter the most important thing would be the departure of Daddy from the country.
Only less than a tenth of them are the most important factors affecting economic recovery or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not resolve conflict
The Syrian youth were asked what is the most important factor in the settlement of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
A fair quarter considers the President of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half of them feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
With military action alone, the only way to resolve the conflict is to believe in a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the Isis’s decline in power over the last year, when the fifth finds its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important battle against Daddy, and generally against terrorism, is that the media should pass on to people information that Daddy has nothing to do with the Islamic faith.
Almost the same number raised military measures and training reform as a priority.
In the opinion of the 10th fair, the most important thing would be to create more paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict does not change during the Trump administration.
Almost every fourth believes in the worsening Syrian conflict during Trump's period.
Two opinions are divided as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoded to keep the web in order - using his database, for example, Wikipedia and Google.
MariaDB, a Spanish company, is developing an open source open-source database that is "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of MariaDB, created by the coder Michael "Monty" Widenius, pays the users nothing, and it can be developed via the internet by any leading programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but paying customers are not necessarily.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, head of technology at MariaDB, spends about half of his time encoded.
A man who works remotely with beauty will help to ensure the smooth functioning of the Internet.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun purchased MySQL with billions of dollars, and one year later, the software dealer Oracle was suffocating Sun with 7.4 billions.
When Oracle was traded, a large part of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a sure promise about MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about ten of the best developers from Sun to ensure that the continuity of the code was safeguarded by the same friends that created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
It was just a change of name.
The freedom to control the development of the MariaDB code was established by the Foundation.
"In the course of MySQL these assurances were not made," Widenius disagrees.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL billions, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
"Our last year's growth rate has been around 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, who is focused on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a poor figure in the company's figures.
To that extent, he reveals that during the current financial period MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
As the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it, from which corporate customers are prepared to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may be more than a year's work if the customer has used the closed database.
The exchange of MySQL to MariaDB will succeed in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are the paying customers of MariaDB.
Most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically distributes to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even if we're a small firm, we're connected to the biggest players.
" amongst our clients are the world's largest telecom operators, gambling companies, banks and even some central bank", Paqvalé's list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP on their closed databases.
Oracle MySQL is also modest compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies, according to Gartner, have lost their market share in recent years, turnover-based players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing sints.
About $50 billion on the database market, open source databases don't even stand up to billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, because most users do not pay for any of these software.
The Gartner research company predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open databases at that time, or at least the transition would have begun.
Large companies do not receive new customers, as most of them choose the open source code next.
This has led to the fact that commercial databases licence fees have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as ever with a smaller number of customers," Widenius discusses.
Since the exchange of the closed database is difficult, most of the customer companies have been obediently swallowing the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult, because their old applications and others are locked in the database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is getting full.
When license fees rise each year, the customer moves to the open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20 percent earlier, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
Moreover, many companies face major system changes when transferring their functions to cloud services.
At the same time, many people exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank.
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now going to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT contracts.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros each year for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is concerned about how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not one of the software companies.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way of making the code.
The community helps and does something that can't come up with or be able to do.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on an open source.
I still have 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy is intensifying its response to the civil society rescue sites
Italy has warned NGOs that their ships will save refugees in the Mediterranean from continuing to operate unless they undertake to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs are not committed to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with La Stampa from Torino.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities were seized by a German aid organisation, Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected to have been cooperating with humane transporters who promoted illegal immigration.
For only a year, the relief agency refused to comment on the detailed charges of the Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosi.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in its opinion published in the social media.
"We can only assess the charges once we have gathered all the necessary information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been watching the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew are suspected to have taken refugees on board by boat, by boat, directly from human-salted transporters who were able to reboot.
One such case is alleged to have happened only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, and the information is provided in the document published by the Public Prosecutor, which contains the Italian media.
The crew are suspected of threatening the Italian Coast Guard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area, and the motive is the enthusiasm for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer in charge of the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced that it would consider new rules unnecessary but acceptable on Thursday, since they do not lead to "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the guidelines are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders Organisation.
Minniti, for his part, said that the rescue measures have led to a sharp fall in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy over the last few weeks, which he considered to be proof that measures to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"Last days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that it was planned to continue this month with discussions with the mayors of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
He's suspected of having died in his open mate in Enontekiö, the suspect was found in the countryside... a case for the prosecutor.
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekio's Kuttase last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected to have killed a 26-year-old Scottish volunteer.
Previously, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have fled with two dogs to the country after his act.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist when he was arrested.
The charges must be brought within less than a week.
The case may still be brought before Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, known for his Harry Potter and all-haired friend series, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was reported by this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started her acting career as a 24-year-old at the theater.
During his long career, he also performed on movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in the All-Earth Friend TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was described seven times.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for the text messages that provoked suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was deemed to have provoked her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an amendment to the judgment and was allowed to wait until the application was processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream-colored blouse, listened to his judgment hands on the cross with a crying look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He chose Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the work", the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was 'cause of the rational conditions that Carter deeply regrets.'
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that Carter "did not have a significant impact on his actions at the age or maturity level, nor even on mental health problems".
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, where her mother said, "It's not even a day before I mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I can cope with all this. I try to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that he "convinced" the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding and not be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car to be poisoned dead in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hide yourself, jump from the roof, stabbed yourself. I don't know, manners are many," Carter wrote in many messages, which he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you are free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention to Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has been shared by experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion article saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Between the worst of Russia and the cold war
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in CNN's interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not get too tight.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a worsening situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia relationship had even gone down to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called on the countries to thank the bad inter-congregation that approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the rear impact experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said that the company believes that "there are even more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions", and he referred to European cities, including BMW's home city in Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installation of emission neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult for cars to afford competitive prices.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of the involvement of large car companies and the problems that have been overcome.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices on cars that reduced emissions in accordance with the regulations in tests. In ordinary driving, emissions were higher.
Several charges have been brought against Volkswagen leaders in the United States, but they are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics manager of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed in its cars a system that could circumvent European emission standards.
Audi’s investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: Volkswagen’s car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela's vote began with a crooked investigation, big demonstrations in promise
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unheard of opinion from a firm that has no role in the outcome of the election, Tibisay Lucena, the chairman of the National Election Commission, told the journalists.
Maduro assures the crisis is over
In Venezuela, a delegation was elected in a controversial vote on Sunday to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against it.
The anti-Maduro opposition has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, the country’s national security forces began the local time on Wednesday night to take over the country’s parliament building.
The purpose of the team is to ensure the security of the nomination ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence’s Laventel
The Lavente list has become a symbol of the Provence region of South France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavenderel had been reduced due to drought and infectious diseases. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is directly under threat in Provence because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has clearly reduced spring and especially autumn rainfall," says Eric Chaisse, an agricultural research institute specialized in CRIEPPAM, in Provence.
"This will shorten the life of the barn.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cash to the area, spreading microbacteria."
The stakes are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient in fragrances and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, instead of long stems and large flowers, which are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts of essential oil."
The solution is sought by increasing watering, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and injecting plants with a mixture of clay and water, and developing more resistant varieties of drought.
The journalist's murder is a growing threat in Mexico
The provision of Riodoce, a once-a-week ministry, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
But today we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Suppliers have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which one is safer: leave the children at home or take them into the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front dashboard of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the journalists for names for each group. Evidence is not needed, findings and feelings are not sufficient.
The table contains names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on government or drug cartel pay lists, who are criminals who make Mexico's chaos a threat to the life of news.
Violence is unabated, and more and more often the victims of the attacks are journalists. According to the Suppliers' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. The Federal State's protection includes 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened. Seven journalists have been murdered in seven states in the past year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and source of inspiration from Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote together on many of his books dealing with drug abuse.
He is deeply excavated, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoc building is covered in a huge picture, where Valdez looks like a central ring. The picture reads: "Right." Thirty-three journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that adorn Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has eyeglasses and a panel made up as a trademark.
The meeting will be held less than two months after the death of Valdez. Journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor's Office was set up, in particular for the handling of cases involving suppliers, but the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers has so far imposed only two charges.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, as are the thousands of drug-trafficking and organised crime-related murders every year.
Riodoc journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little benefit to the Security Council because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodoce's supply in the state capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven in the red Toyota only a couple of blocks away, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number probably relates to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away with Valdez's car and wrecked it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn for his wife and two adult children.
The rumors move fast, and you're free to go to Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is a mouse silence.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January. Competing groups want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and the graveyard has two-storey grave buildings decorated with drugs, larger than many households.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a competing group that is fighting the boys of Guzman.
The story may have upset the boys of Guzman: customers suspected of joining the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the points of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published on the same subject was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroest when he decided in 2003 to set up with five colleagues in Riodocen. The magazine’s shares were sold at that time at $50.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its business, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
The journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class investigative journalism without fear of a censor, and readers were enthusiast about stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Suppliers' Committee on Protection from its courage to follow the story of Mexico's drug trafficking.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the award from the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers.
Drug trafficking is a "lifeline" in Sinalo, Valdez said in the interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The operator must accept a falling mission – or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
The staff of Riodoce misses Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always received hugs and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a porridge hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminants don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business operations, their secret drug trade disputes.
They were left out of business," Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-esteem and self-protection,
confidence in your own instincts.
If it feels like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to the Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can be betrayed, and so happened in the case of Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to enter a room where Riodoc security training was held, and a few days earlier it had become clear that only spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter from the tree shadow at 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of the Riodocs, which are located in a four - block building in the middle - class Culiacan area.
Some journalists thought half of their play was whether these two police officers belonged to the 50% which the governor of the state did not believe to be reliable.
It had been months since the journalists visited the mountainous countryside of the drug gangs.
This week's delivery of Riodocs planned three main issues.
The boxing size Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s use of money had focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, together with Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the Public Prosecutor’s Office, there was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favor of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician from the Governing Institutional Revolution (PRI). PRI has been in charge of Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in a large number of cases of publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. One of them, the son of El Chapo Guzman, managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would have had reliable information on the Valdez column about the kidnapping.
"We would have already known what had happened before," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname "El Flaco", Ohukainen because of his thin body structure.
"Now all the connections to our sources of information have been cut off."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists will be kept. The press workers have been given a new, unexpected job: they have become press freedom activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took with him a few signs when he left the next morning for a demonstration by the local prosecutor’s office, the reason of which was the murder of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found which is Adame based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. The SOS Press texts appear in demonstrations for pedestrians and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, Washington, where he is seeking international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from government matters because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, permissive authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks against journalists last year were committed by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralytic effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of Tamaulipas in the border state six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writings."
He was cut off by his head with his computer keyboards and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop working, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of the Chihuahua border state after the March murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to the drug cartels on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and we must be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals look for the journalist, as apparently visited photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in the apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is frightening.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
A while ago, Riodoc journalists were sitting in front of the delivery on Friday night at the foot of the beer, when the latest issue of the magazine was finished.
In the shooting of rival gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed in Mazatlan's beach resort.
The war has accelerated, as promised in the reports of the cartel found in the area.
The journalists put the news on Riodoce's website with their footer smartphones.
We had to put the house back on the next day.
The sirens opened up in the vicinity — another shooting.
Bojorquez would look at the delivery of security officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where a man shows a central ring to the whole of Sinalo.
Bojorquez says you can't even think about stopping the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked us to get on the street to do it the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project started with a huge setback.
Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old in April, got short because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the training period began disastrously when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It began a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
The May was practically completely sick.
First, there was a flu, and finally, there was a childhood disease like an inflammation of the ear, in which I had to eat antibiotics.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember when I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get any use for the practice, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 received a internship permit only in the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU's roll-off test on competition and top-level sports on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis by rolling on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the athlete’s finger from the needle to the lactic acid sample.
Last fall, 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There was a fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
Better
After the initial exams, Manninen tells us that she was healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises in which I have sought to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now behind it is a really good five-week episode.
There was also a one - and - a - half - week vacation at the airport.
I had time to go to a cottage with my family.
In the last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup homecomings.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manninen got on top ski 18.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the main coach of the national team Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We're now getting a different rhythm compared to the practice in the last period.
After the first-sail races, he'd have a three-world Cup weekend.
In December, the intention would be to join at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still have to be made in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, we'll find a name on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
Pyeongchang's Olympics would already be Man's sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, a numerical underline celebrated in the gold team competition held in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur protected himself against the enemy by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first research results of a species of horny rhino found by a Canadian miners, which had been so well preserved that the experts call it Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that the researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was reddish brown and had had a "problemal past".
According to the current biology magazine, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur and the world's best species.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which was in the middle of the accession period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well - preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the best-preserved fossil of its kind has been the armored vegetable eater.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit someone who did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in Kalli was sent to the royal paleontological museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a block of 1,100 kilos.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you siren your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science dinosaurs Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and reminded of a walking tank.
Its red and white armor disguised it from predators, and it also protected it from darker and brighter colour, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and it is now on display in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
The researchers have named it Borealope Markmitchelli, a museum engineer named Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours of digging dinosaurs.
Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the team of international researchers have been able to determine the pattern and shape of its body's veins and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a general coloration in the animal world, where the body is darker and lighter from the top.
However, the observation was a surprise because Borealope is considerably larger than the current animals with the same colour.
It suggests that the dinosaurs eating meat caught it to the extent that evolution favored survival as a means of hiding rather than a battle.
Today’s animals, for example, have similar colours with deer, zebra and armadillos, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The catch of a large, strongly armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the joining period were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of nodosaur’s organic compounds in the vultures reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea where it sank to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also been preserved in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early period of accession.
It doesn't take much imagination to figure it out: if you cut a little bit of eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The joining period was the age of the theropods, huge two-legged dinosaurs, eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus Rex, or millions of years earlier, their mighty predecessors may have caught this armored dinosaur.
For example, Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the predecessors of Acrocanthosaurs, a monster of about 11.5 metres in length.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed off after its death and mummyed into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best preserved armored dinosaur with leather and armored hem.
The nodules were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilos.
Two half-metres of pike rose from their frames.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetable eater passed through the present West Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has retained small details in the seabed grave.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its skin remains in the tank’s holed plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic that such conservation is "more rare than a lottery victory.
The more it looks, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilized leather on the holed discs of its skull.
Its right front is on its side, five toes up.
I'm also able to calculate the pros and cons of its foot base."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked by 9.8.2014.
He had previously arrived in New York City from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on a bed to browse Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed the message from his high school partner:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
As he was confused, he noted that no one else had sent the same information to his entry. Therefore, he closed on Facebook and opened on Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweetings from the user @ThePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper who lives in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told to gather for Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police's closing tapes and screaming people as well as Brown's father-claimed man, who was carrying the sign, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of the police standing in front of protestors with a barking dog.
He also tells me that he saw a video in which another police officer set his rifles and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalls.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've become used to and could be called a type of murder.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and cried."
He booked the return flight for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 a.m. and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they should go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson within the next three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets?" was made. It received its first night at the cinemas on 11 August 2007.
The film is a story of survival and mental expression, love and loss, as well as strength and determination from the point of view of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell was heading for Ferguson to the flower tree and his daughter dressed in a crown compatible with it, they had a discussion again on "how to live in black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how the blacks had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed the 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't help not having a daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of this day are... the peak of events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know that and to grow up with it.
He must get the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and the circumstances of the experience of the Black, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from violent racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, which is opposite the police station, which became an activist camp when they were waiting for information on the case and finally found out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the minority medical student organization. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of the document in his evening speech.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to simply tell" what was going on.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and insinuation.
"We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," said Folaya recently in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folaya had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activation with the prisoners who were sentenced to death.
Davis was involved with Ferrell to take part in the project together with six other locals. The description team followed events in the years following the shooting of Brown.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Davis says.
"It was most important to me how local people are presented in the film, because I am presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was wanted to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community".
That's why we're seeing surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty low on myself," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story once and again brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Of the three founders, two of them are identical to the queer identity.
"The leadership of the black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "That's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
The black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folaya agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women with a lot of queer women."
He stressed, however, that Ferrelli was not selected for his "self-explanatory" cross-identity.
"He got energy on the move," Folayan says.
"However, it's not a coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live on many points of surgery, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy comes from white cloth."
News groups have long since left Ferguson, but there is still a tight gap between the Community and the police.
Ferrell's got another two and a half years of parole, and he's been sentenced to shut down the highways in a protest.
His description of the social-political climate at home is short and central: "A mess."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned from the outside of Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our prosperity is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose ourselves."
Appropriate consistency: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space of faces – white, black and brown faces, which can be seen more closely from the perspective of equality.
These 30 works are portraits of artists Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he passed a 35-year sentence. Manning was sentenced secretly for leaking classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblanche exhibition was opened on 2 August 2007.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and pioneering opponent whose prison sentence was reduced to a third day by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg analyses Manning's DNA algorithm and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, although a little theoretical statement of the changeability, versatility and underlying causal relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has been openly told that she has been familiar with women since the breakup. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning who was sentenced to prison: a rough, black and white selfie, where Manning is sitting in the driver’s seat in the car. He has a platinum-white wig at his head, which became his symbol.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had received a great popularity from the Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
There he created forms based on forensic data, he got DNA data from, for example, tobacco dumps and gums, and he created pictures of how the people in question might have looked.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us at the new exhibition.
At Manning's house, he couldn't visit and could not be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making Manning's DNA image.
Suddenly, the artist and his prisoner became friends in correspondence, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a copy of the Deleted Images comic, which Shoili Kanungo imagined, describing the future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the comic book was published, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years of suffering in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump is in his own war against information leakers and transgender soldiers and is inventing new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful twins that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everyone has his purpose."
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist’s statement and under it Manning’s large signature, where the last of the last names i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for the end of the “automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based”.
The opposite wall has a Manning DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written with a lead pen.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the artist uses the scientific definition – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least in our biological field.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal from our genetics and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also presents his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"D.N.A. tells countless stories, and there are 30 here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: the page of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they get you down, they've won," says the picture.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The technique is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he greets his face based on his own genetics as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like all others in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA episode has been written at a lead pen height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The Kasvos were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring them after the crowd felt," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are sought for murder as suspects
The police report that they have launched national searches to find an employee of the Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University who are suspected of being stabbed to death in a Chicagolian luxury residence.
The documents of the Cook County Court show that on Monday the arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranalau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to the local news release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and the arrest was investigated as murder, and the police actively sought out two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiological and immunology at the Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and that he has been denied access to the Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University is helping in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent as a financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to assist the investigation authorities in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Intelligence at Chicago Police Department, said that he seriously urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are located, and we keep checking our search," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help the suspects in their search.
He told the police that he had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had received an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He told security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board published the following press release: "We should investigate the current course of events and the background to the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the judge said to the police.
Moffattin must provide a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
Suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police for threats.
The threat was not related to bookstore events.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same costume as the suspect in bookstore events, said the police reporter.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogation.
As a penalty, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay £ 620, i.e. approximately € 690 legal expenses and £ 85, i.e. approximately € 95, for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's reporter, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the actions in line with the Wada road map in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko of Russia
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Office (WADA) road map to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"The road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKD.
The Wada road map has been updated in this respect", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the Wada road map, which sets out the conditions for the return of the competences of RUSA. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that is of concern to Russia.
"All has been notified and all is carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
However, one point of the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study by WADA, a Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the alleged share of the state in Russian sport doping.
That's what Mutko said: "The investigation is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit something that was not there."
In short, there were echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media on the same day, admitted that there have been problems in the anti-doping agencies in Russia. "We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report without a proposal", however, he added.
WADA ordered RUSA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been exposed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA's director Olivier Niggli visited Russia's headquarters in Moscow in July. After his visit, he declared that the organization was on the right path towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of Finnish innovation: health benefits of maternity packs "there is no evidence"
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, who fights covert killings, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packages in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package would reduce the risk of hiding.
Cash loss means the baby's unexplainable sudden death.
Lullaby Trust acts as a UK health authority expert in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer be able to pack our official brochures for them, because it would make us understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed us.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading results from many different reasons, such as the small number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that a box is given to every family there may be one factor.
But you can't say that for sure," said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages will be marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
Maternity pack is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers free of charge for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, its boxes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, for its part, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for bedtime if there is no field or cot available.
The organization recommends that you only use the package for the day sleep and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn around.
It also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
♪ ♪ A big pig ran away from a Japanese zoo again ♪
Japanese zoo staff are looking for a turtle to escape.
The giant shield has surprised the staff at its speed and has run away again in two weeks.
The turtle fled from Shibukawa zoo in Okama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told us.
The 35-year-old woman is a female, 55-kilometer-long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the grassy area.
The zoo has not received sightings of turtles.
The last trip to the country happened last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online shop startup, but the questions did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured them that the questions were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," Errett explains. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside assistance.
The market has become increasingly new start-ups in human resources management, helping other companies to find out how their employees can work.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Businesses can make surveys and target them to certain teams and population groups and provide their employees with anonymous notification services and in some cases direct contact with the government.
"Your own health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure employee commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He tells us that he has gained a deeper view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick enquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map with one view of which departments the workers are more dissatisfied and which of the leaders have received the most weak estimates, which have enabled Errett to get to the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow a job culture so that they do not become the next Uber. Around the transport company has been raging since the ex-worker wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people talking about problems are punished.
Such omissions for startups such as Glint are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a start-up that helps companies detect and prevent improper use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a collision.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed a contract with Uber, too.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report improper behaviour anonymously by means of a text message.
And if the manager is to have reason to doubt the facts, the complaints go directly to the company's government.
"The public opinion has excluded the authorities," says Convert founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He pointed out that if the company treats its employees badly or is acting unethically, the consequences could be costly, even if the authorities did not intervene. Consumers could start to boycott the company, and it could also lose employees and be challenged for justice.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees at 500 offices. The company has used Convert for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address that enabled him to make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's lawyer James Vitrano. "He said the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal acts related to employment relations."
According to Quinlan, companies started to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen, an audit firm, broke down as a result of unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only with the help of the social media did companies realize that they could no longer prevent their filthing from being public.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convert offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convert have the support of venture capital investors.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of USD 60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and risk capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more jobs than before.
Good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning in competitive markets such as Pilaakso.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn's Compensation and Well-being Company.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, and businesses succeed when employees are committed.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts on employment culture, information on employee engagement is important.
But it's useless if you don't take action.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered as a sign of change.
And if change is not fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee commitment.
"If four thousand proposals are requested, four thousand discussions must be prepared," says Russell Raath, Director General of Kotter International, Business Management, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
"If the company does not take action, the employees will start to wonder if they could be heard
And do they have any difference in their opinion?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently making staff inquiries on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated workers on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in the sector known for the great variety of employees.
"If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And there are no businesses without customers."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked female neighbor, says the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower after she had noticed a cell phone hanging outside her window.
She says that a cell phone camera took the picture in the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell was first pulled up, but soon after it was recalculated in the window.
A 20-year-old man on the cover-up has admitted to photographing a woman.
He claimed, however, that he only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed and the police had failed to return it to prove it.
In the interrogations, the man admitted to the crime, but denied his guilt for the crime.
The man described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as a "crazy madman."
According to TT, the case is brought against a man.
Teachers demand more lashes in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cutting of public sector holiday money underlines the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination does not in any way involve the reduction of the leave payments.
In the municipal sector, contracts are only concluded once private sector documents have been signed and increases are clear.
Luke predicts, for example, that the OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luke did not reveal yet.
Luke is also the Chairman of the Jukk Public Sector Trained Negotiating Organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday cash surgery adds to the differences in earnings
According to the OAJ, the statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of employees in the public sector is declining while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Lukeinen, a temporary leave cut will further accentuate differences in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher should be defined.
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the Bruins players extended as NCAA reduced the daily exercises two together
It's almost 11:00 a.m., and a bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their shirts and their backs shine off the sand after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this talk class is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the students at the university will return to the dormitory to study the final exams. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center at half past seven.
"The three days will come when the poor will come for these friends," says Bruins coach Jim Mora a little before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
This change was aimed at reducing the amount of work done by the players, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That's why the first three exercises of UCLA started at 15 minutes at night, and it was difficult to find space in the full schedule of players.
Limiting the training levels in one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time that Moran has continued in the six-way training period in Westwood, while the exercises are held at the same time with the summer courses.
Exercises are supposed to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season opening game begins: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported NCAA's regulatory change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We carry them very much for three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think the situation will be easier when we get to Saturday, so we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises after the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view of the nearby parking area and the Lusk Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with anti-torture football networks.
Bruins players are supposed to change the hotel in the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are accessible to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and photograph the exercises there for the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
There's a lot to be paid for from the practice video.
But we have guards there and the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
The Central African Rwanda will hold the presidential elections on Friday, which are already considered to be a clear winner.
Paul Kagame has been working officially for his third period, but in practice he has influenced the management of the country since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organised by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of falsifying poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to try, because the two-year-long Constitution of the Presidency was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
In his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investments have been invested in the country.
Kagam has also played a major role in bringing the country of genocide together.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised its people more freedom after the land has been raised to its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting lies by stepping up the fact check
Facebook intends to send potential lies to increasingly independent fact auditors and present the results under the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this Thursday.
The company published an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify lies. Any lies will be sent to the fact auditors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the largest falsifiers in the world. Many people believe that the illuminator influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with lies before the presidential elections in May and Germany preparing for the elections in September will support the plan to penalise social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
In a separate statement published in Germany on Thursday, Facebook announced that the fact-finding is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what to read and share", says the product manager Sara Su of the Facebook news feed in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Related Articles feature and will make other changes to its news content to reduce lies.
Birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small castle of Scotney in Kent is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideaway from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming place in the Bewlin river valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old, moped-hair writer.
"It's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says.
"I feel the personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the edvardian era. Each story has imagined different artists, promising British cartoonist Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes archives. In 2014 he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library.
"I moved to tears in my letter with a thumbprint. The letter had written a double agent for the Jacobs in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time the lighting was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
The writer, who was attracted to the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay a little longer than he would have hoped.
He spent the days exploring Victorian "new" castles, archives, treasures and rareties, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles that had been hanging in the algal for centuries.
He circled the ruins and holdings of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes also artists who picture the book.
In the evening, he took whiskey and started writing.
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years with the same method: taking all the extra things to the attic.
The archives had journals, letters from the times of the British Empire, and maps of who owned anything. "I could imagine that the land was boring," Rhodes says. "However, this is where families fought even for one side.
I thought I wouldn't let that happen."
Some of the book’s stories are moving from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, is associated with the British peasant casket in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mention that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"An English peasant casserole began in the same area, and it became clear that the rebellion could start from riot.
Perhaps these events are connected to each other?"
The other stories of the book are closely linked to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell’s family hid for seven years during the Kingdom Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the smuggler Arthur Darrell's story of the 1700s. He is said to have set up his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been a lot of predators. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the family of Darrell solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who knew how to make heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Lebensmä, a healing plant in the early 20th century, which is left with only an unbridled plot.
Scotney's castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," she says.
"I wouldn't want to go back to this bad day."
Between Russia's worst and the coldest war
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in CNN's interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not get too tight.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a worsening situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia relationship had even gone down to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called on the countries to thank the bad inter-congregation that approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klishko quit the replay against Anthony Joshua.
The world champion Vladimir Klishko, who is a long-time champion of the professional career, will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Klitshko took a professional 69 times winning 64 of the matches.
He held a number of MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitsh lost his career for two final fights.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and, after a fierce fight, lost in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rerun at Las Vegas in November.
However, Klishko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me in his press release.
As an amateur and professional player, I arrived at everything I dreamed about, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at Klitshko's reasons for his decision on the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte reported in the press that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been with the American actor Hayden Panettieren since 2009.
The couple has one child, the daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Clitchko's big brother Vitali is also a former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In the years 2008-12, the brothers ruled the MM-artists of the various unions at the same time.
Finland's meteorist is in a state of conditions: "Exit from the file"
Moped skiers Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer iron season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken away a woman from the cold.
Even the London World Cups have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks about the weather.
The circumstances have been the subject of this fine stand-up attack against Minna Nikka.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was unimaginable that I didn't even get small stakes to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here know how many times and I have never experienced the same varied wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this season, the standard of jumping has been really difficult, even when there have been so unstable winds in practice, Nikkanen said in Kaleva races.
The weather was talking in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together... whether it's cold-shrink or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been gone.
It doesn't make sense to use energy in a bad condition.
He got his jump in the hall thanks to 455 for the World Cup.
There's been 445 out there.
It's not the same in London.
We have to be moderate and wait for a better wind.
The aim is to exceed 460 on Friday's ban.
Why don't you change your training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the pile and the technology was standardized.
I guess I should've done the same right now.
Normally, it's been through the hall to practice, and now the hall's been closed.
What would it be like to be a great race?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
A little wind will happen, as long as it's constant.
Experienced ex-officer bore politicians with Uple: "We have no room for money now and many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep the ice in its hats and warn against the blazing of the government budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen of the budgets prepared for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room.
Yle interviewed Virta, who was retired in 2015, in the middle of the week.
Next year's budget is about to start.
Recently, politicians' proposals on the raising of a guarantee pension, the reduction of car tax and the support of electric bicycles have been highlighted.
They mainly tell us that the elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the government budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for manoeuvre now and not for many years.
I even feel like it's a fraud to talk about the money when you're in debt, Virtanen said to Yle.
And I'm going to put it on the record that all the debt is owed to the kids.
In 1978, he joined the Ministry of Finance as Secretary-General of the Budget and subsequently worked as Deputy Head and Head of Budget of the Budget Department.
The last time he retired, he was head of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In Yle's interview, Virtanen pointed out that the forecast of 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All fortune-tellers estimate that this is a peak that is already starting next year to go to the bottom line, and Finland expects a 1% increase in tens of years.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules on a permanent residence permit, namely the Green Card, will be amended by means of a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants benefitting from the new search process who know English and can support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the media.
The Queen's spouse of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree shot in April.
Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and this half prince Henrik, 83, does not bury next door, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde's court church, the court notes when it issued its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and titles in the Danish monarchy, court communication manager Lene Belleby commented on the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not treating him as an equal mate.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a place of burial and understands the decision.
A terrible moment on the road: The car had to come on the highway
Tom's got a couple of extras and two little kids on the ride.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive money from insurance if the other party is not aiming.
There was an accident at the Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive image of Kula III's construction site.
Vantaainen Tommi tells us that on Tuesday his family survived a miracle shop in a car accident.
Tommi, her open mate Riina and two small children of the couple drove on the highway at the Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the III connection to the Hämeenlinnaväyja, the acceleration lane ran along the white car, which was driving on the family car side, Tommi says.
Without the traffic, the car would have come on top with Tom.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand," Tommi tells.
The family's car hit the rails at high speed.
Parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is under the age of three, the other is under the age of one year.
Apparently it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one passed by even to us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident happened around 5:20 p.m.
Tom says no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own strength.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue department came and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to ransom.
Tommi tells him and the open-minded one have little income, and they were given the comfort to buy a car a few years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family, according to Tomm, will not receive any money from insurance.
That is why the family wishes to see the eyes from the car that drove the family.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the yard and work without it," Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably since the late 1990s or early 2000.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the guilty person is not caught, I don't know how we're doing economically, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that someone who has seen or knows something about it will be in touch with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had an accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and the case was fixed at 9:15 p.m.: Unlike the case originally reported, the other car, according to Tom, did not come from the receiving lane, but was driving from the acceleration lane to the family's side of the car.
Lotta Jäppien's directed performance deals with human relations by the means of humor - Self-discipliner seen in What?-theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-class guidance to the What? Theatre.
The self-displayer is a music theatre of bad past relationships and inadequate relationships.
Director Lotta According to Jäppinen, it still makes good sense.
The subject is dealt with by the means of humor.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to stay out of it, he says.
The rotating summer theatre has been carried out according to Jäppinen with a high budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the show challenges us to consider what a person reveals himself when he gets to know a new person.
Is he maybe playing a role or is he approaching another coat?
Juoneton presentation mixes the facts and fiction
The Jappinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the text of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that even though the performance is about the ideas of young people, it speaks of all ages.
The Jappinen stresses that the self-destructor does not directly tell his own or the working group about human relations.
The facts and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own world of worth cares about the show.
I don't think human relationships are bad, but I don't think human relationships, especially couples, are a condition for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäpkinen believes that the self-destructor draws the current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot from their relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least it's that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka will perform.
The task force also includes a costumer, Ella Snellman.
The musical arrangement is Jäppiinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre started in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, who comes from Kouvola, studies as director of the theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
It's been two years and there's another mess in front of you.
The last enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The teacher of the music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and has performed, among other things, at Yöppilasteaster in Helsinki and most recently at Linnatheater in Turku.
Steering has become more and more interesting.
Last week in Helsinki, the self-destructer got his first night at Narr's scene.
At least in Jäppien's study town in Turku, the show that lasted about 45 minutes was also seen in the future.
Self-destructor Kouvolan What? Theatre 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - his neck broke
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtala.
As a partner, the world circled for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued its dream of the Olympic Gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtala's business continued.
He was not only an untiring intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
I don't suppose there are many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical lake would have tried at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtala completely.
In 2014, Lahtala was hit by a motorcycle accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I was licking wounds at my home for a year, Lahtela says.
It was a bad luck for me to leave.
He also admits that age could have played a part in the fall.
You know, driving with a pretense can sound wild.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just so hard as a species that you don't have too much fun with this kind of four-quarter!
After the accident, Lahtala had to deal with a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long run back as the head coach of Japan’s freestyle team.
Lahtla began to suffer immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during training Lahtla often challenged his protector in the slope and in the physics tests.
Surprised, it was a good experience to stop.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in position.
I'm actually enjoying it because I really only got to be once.
The compulsory break inspired Lahtala to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid that he'd come to an end.
It's easier to find places in the body that's gone past the past!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtla joined the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby instead of speeding.
I switched motocrosses to frisbeegolf!
It just got off the stage right now.
Worst of all, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtla has always been a super eager trainer herself, she does not require her training to be the same as she.
I'm not forcing everyone to do the same thing.
There is room for our species culture to have its own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is free style, and mentality has always been in line with it," Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It's here: a report on technological development in the sexrobot sector – just as it had started to feel that 2017 can no longer become weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Fondation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sexirobots within the next 5-10 years.
"We must begin to take a serious view of the proliferation of sex robots," says founder of the Foundation and robotic and artificial intelligence professor Noel Sharky of Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"The sex robots are being chained, but they're already being sold quite a lot, and we're going to see them more and more," Sharky said in public.
Sex dolls are developed from throbbing dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence-like features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to his/her own preferences, from color of eyes to size of nipples and type and colour of fingernails.
Even more worrying is the fact that robots have "personality" that makes the women of Stepfod look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls are developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of RealBotix robot can be adapted to your user’s preferences, for example, as shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is as fully adapted as possible to the user's personality", is advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, with a chat or with a "wind."
There are many worrying features in the proliferation of sex robots, replacing genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies, as users approach, for example, a shy and hostile programmed robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just fetishes or new sex toys.
Their proliferation and development tell of something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one alternative among others.
Of course, most men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sexirobots have begun to become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the White House is the President, who has boasted of harassing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (The Slavery) is not the most worrying of its powerful visual language, for example images of the hanged body and the excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
The attempt is being made to make sex robots as much as technically possible, such as real women (at the dimensions of the pornoites).
Robotic developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or situation.
They have neither their own will nor their own history — no independence - or complete submission to fantasy.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, a group led by the Chief of the Daddys
The head of the Isis organization led a group of Australian men who were suspected to have planned to take the bomb to the plane of the Etihad Airways company.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the manager of the fathers had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was intended to be taken to the aircraft on 15 July, but the company interrupted prior to the security check.
The police won't tell us more exactly why the company stopped.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic-free gas-discharge device and take it to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phela said that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in the police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Trump's good side?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a perk of common sense
In Trump's period, it has been repeated to the point of fatigue that the strong division of voters has also broken down families at the level of everyday life.
On the road to Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory columns of the American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trumpi.
We all want to blow up our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to combine families.
I'm going to tell you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet who's been living in Chicago for a long time now.
He recalled that a common enemy could have a powerful uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins — including a sister who supports Republicans, with whom he has been discussing politics for decades — are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly thought about it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidential term can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to frighten his tricks.
In the longer term, there is an even worse chance that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans who suddenly seem perfectly reasonable compared to Trump.
I'm reminding you of Mitt Romney's smooth version of madness: dog on the car roof, 14% income tax (and at least his tax return we've seen).
After Trump's season is over, the next presidential candidate for Republicans only needs to be clear, and it immediately seems to be a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in New York Park, and the best thing in New York that you'll get for three dollars without caffeine.
Karusell’s horses are huge, in the middle of the characters — loose clowns and animals looking back in terror — evil, and background-sounding music is strangely fascinating.
In time, many of the features of New York are becoming disappointed: the views of tall buildings are beginning to get tired, the city's silo becomes too familiar and the city's reality does not correspond to dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, have not managed to overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large transport circle in northern London. Yet, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it does not count.
Instead, the central park carousel still has a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two two years old, one eleven and two four - foot - old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week in the department store to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reading device.
The same thing in the café in my corner of the house, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15% of the service money when I go to the coffee table myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pushes the customer servant to put his person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The store salesman smiled at me when I was tired of giving my credit card five stars to the experience of using it.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from the Inter.
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's team of representatives from the duties of coach.
The training responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccaret as an assistant coach.
The other training team will continue its current duties.
The Italian Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in, among other things, Sunderland, England.
In January, 59-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter training team, completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
President of FC Inter’s Board Stefan Håkan’s regret.
The change of coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuqi, however, no longer had the confidence of the management of the company, so there was no other option at this time, Håkan's comment in the Society's newsletter.
The Piccareta agreement is in force until the end of the season.
Together with the other training team, he is already responsible for the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to Evening-Sanomie's information, the team has been raging along Thursdays.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that I'm following assistant coach Piccaret and John Allen has been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong stand in the Interi match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
In Instagram, violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture.
Several weddings have been added to the picture, on the basis of which it can be concluded that the musician is a 16-year-old student of Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonder about a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's communicating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a pair of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius pondered his own growth as a human and referred to eating disorders that he suffered younger.
20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is, I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to the English assailant life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has openly spoken about his eating habits of previous years.
He was already 14 years old at the hospital because of anorexia and ortorex.
A little later he also became ill with bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The recovery began a little while ago.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the cuts he had on his wrist, which, according to the prison authorities, he had dropped in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the defendants complained of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was an intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to reapply because they consider the sentence of Pistorius to be too light for six years.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the sentence of Pistorius may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a group of camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st. There were two Bulgarians among the camped people.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those who camp outside the areas reserved for purpose.
The checks will be continued until the end of the season.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
The liquid stock is sinking, and the decline is already 7.7%.
Oil processor Neste's share has decreased by 7.7 per cent by about 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started today on the loose side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of a small number of exchanges, a large European Stoxx 600 index had been launched at 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after half an hour of trading and the OMXH25 of the most exchanged companies had started by 0.3 per cent.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may reduce irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: dietary intake of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate pelvic bowel syndrome.
An irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan in protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the tolerance of the intestine.
According to the study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the veins and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Irreversible cells balance cells that enhance tolerability, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the infection, the result may be an irritable bowel syndrome.
Tests have shown that immune cells that enhance tolerability are found in mice with certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan so that immune cells start to appear. Tryptophan is one of the proteins that build up.
"We found a connection between the development of Lactobacillus reuter and the development of cells that promote tolerability. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the intestinal normal microbioma," says Professor Colonna.
"The more mice had tryptophan, the more immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce the sensitivity to inflammation.
When studying the tolerability of immune cells, researcher doctor Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that although one mouse group had such cells, they did not have the same mouse type that was kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, i.e. the gastrointestinal normality of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When DNA from the intestines of mice was examined, six bacterial species were detected in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter was given to mice in a sterile environment that did not have intestinal microbioma and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – from mice to isolated immune cells.
The immune cells developed into stronger cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in mice, the number of tolerable cells increased by about 50 per cent. When the number of tryptophans was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerability as they do in mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuteri cells can develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, tryptophan-related genetic errors have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate the infection on the inside of the intestine," says Cervantes-Barraga.
"The high level of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reutere bacteria may contribute to their proliferation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" in his ranks after he signed an agreement with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United won the "genius" contract with Nemanja Matic. Midfielder debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea to Dublin with £40 million, won 2–1 in the last match in the United, before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made the impression as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best condition yet, because he was not on a tour of the blue-tailed Asia until the beginning of the season. He managed only 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, it has to be changed before the beginning of the election season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has a natural ability to think in football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready better than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cut his starting composition for the beginning of the season.
Independent this week revealed that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the company has already done "a great job" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four – we have to thank the company for that," he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they did excellent work."
Balloons bullied Germany for two sets
The Finnish women's balloon team lost its fourth match of MM-karsintaturnaus to Germany directly in it 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine playing is high.
Their game was in every sector, Finland's main coach Tapio Kangasniemi told the press.
In the first two instalments, Finland held on to its opponents, but in the third instalment Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we were played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to play along with him, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective was Pia Korhonen, who collected 14 points in Finland.
Three of the four lost Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand jurors have already sent challenges to Trump Jr's meeting with Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natali Veselnitskaya’s meeting.
The great jury called up by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the well-known Russian lawyer Natal Veselnitskaya.
The news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms the fact that the Wall Street Journal, previously revealed on Thursday, called a large jury.
According to Reuters, the large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr and Kremlin-known Veselnitskaya, which was held between the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the current White House advisor Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters, the fact that the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of Russia's investigation is summarised.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to assist a large jury in an investigation that seeks to resolve Russia's interference with the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his neighbour's cooperation with Russia was made.
The great jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on an electoral basis.
The great jurors are a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A large jury will weigh the evidence investigated by the prosecutor and decide whether the case should be brought.
The British inventor microchiped himself to get home and into his car with a swing of his hand
The British inventor has first microchiped himself in the whole country so he can open his home outside door, get into his office and launch his car with a swing.
Microchip is 33-year-old Steven Northam between his thumb and front finger. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a doctor of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
Microchips use the same technology as cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Northam also transforms the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed the microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a helicopter to the southern grass field of the White House to the American production event was to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is named Marine One when the president is on its way. It was a bet at the event held in the White House on 17 July 2017, where American building programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a number of White House officials visited products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the samples included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office had only requested a helicopter at the site about 36 hours before landing at the "extraordinary" event on the southern lawn, which is shown in the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the forces.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote on the day before the event in his e-mail to his superior, the Marine Air Force Assistant Commandant.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn field on July 17 at 7 a.m. and the event would start at 3 a.m. Only after the lawn field was emptyed at night between 6 and 9 a.m.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter were to leave the White House, a second crew would be needed due to service time limitations.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the time of the incident, and the unit security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received from the TIME magazine do not show whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, the HMX-1 asked if the incident broke the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told that there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of the reform of the health care system at the Senate, as well as of a more loose government regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their travels,
but their use for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the background to the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, Secretary for Press at the White House.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train in the southern grass field to bring the President to the White House with a centimetres of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training calculations for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters were also flown on that day for 11 hours in "non-presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, no other costs were incurred by taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s reporter reported that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration at the southern grass field of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have accounts for flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation level is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from the Quantico base to the White House from the state of Virginia and back lasted a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is clearly lower.
"Calculating the cost of taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called "reduced costs" to be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to RAND’s 2015 report, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"It's time to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of helicopters and other defenses that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to present it."
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the white house, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three of them."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track, the trains will have to be replaced by buses.
The passenger train traffic between the Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical fault, reports the Rataverkehrszentrum.
For the time being, the trains will be replaced by buses.
The fault of the traffic control system caused a thunderstorm.
In the morning, there was no estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela’s State Prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the representative elected in the vote last Sunday is to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative of the country was elected, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to the Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the decision to block it has been requested on the grounds of suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also started a vote on the electoral campaign.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held a representative vote said that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were eligible, and Maduro's son and wife were included in the elected 545-member representation.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the representative can break down the Congress led by the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the drafting of the Constitution as a means of strengthening Maduro's position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, in turn, declared that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representative is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has continued for months.
They have wounded numerous people and more than 100 are dead.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after the oil price dropped.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show an opinion on Friday, when the new representative will have to start.
A Russian man given up in Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, on Thursday, the United States court of Minneapolis sentenced the 41 - year - old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for being involved in a worldwide computer scam.
Shenah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US claim.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was coming home.
Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, says AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after being arrested, harshly denounced Finland and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecution, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which was seized by tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used information by continuing to control Internet traffic, which made clicks and spam available.
According to Kenneth Blanco, head of the Department of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.
Edited at 20.58: Corrected the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third production season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will rise to the main part in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed during the second production season of Narcos, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
A third and fourth production period is already confirmed for the series. A third-period trailer has been released and it presents the new vehicles.
In the third period of production, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trading organisation.
The organization headed by the four ghosts operates "as Fortune 500 company", except that the authorities have a little more corruption and violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peñana, who recruits Americans and Colombian police to the war against drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light art work in Paris
The Joensuu light artist Kari Kola (in the trunk) will perform an exceptional light art work in honour of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next 16 May.
Kola is doing a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the building of Fontenoy, the headquarters of Unesco, and the Globe monument that represents it.
I would like to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the lighting rate of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the things I have experienced more concretely visible, says Light Artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Light Day and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she lit the holiday in honor of UNESCO’s headquarters.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may even expand significantly.
We will inform you later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first light day will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting at the mall in Espoo
Two men were born into a dispute in Espoo shopping mall in Iso Omena Park Hall on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between the drivers.
The driver, who was driven in a forbidden direction, would hit the driver of another car, resulting in this car moving, striking a hit on the car.
After that, he hit a car still collapsing into the engine.
In the preliminary discussion, the man admitted that he had caused injury and that he had done wrong.
Timo Soin's question mark: "After that, the flood came"
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog, which is titled on a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven national representatives.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 1700s.
King Ludvig XV or this lover's Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the sentences "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are on the condition of the provincial council elections, three women are elected as vice-presidents and more than 30% of recently registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized", Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban has presented threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving towards a consultative role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from democratically elected government to government.
Haysom said that women's contributions strengthen Afghan democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million registered voters are women.

The flood threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly concerned with the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it 'eat and flee' tourism: it is only a few hours away and it's going through the sights of the big crowds.
Venice is crowded with fast day trips to the city.
It's hard to move on the cape streets, and the beautiful squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice can't fit in anymore.
They have been forced to move more and more away from the historic centre while the homes have become hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist destinations.
They call the present phenomenon a poor-quality tourism. Low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the ticket guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and the Square of St Mark, and turn back, describes the current and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic center of Venice.
On the side of the gate is the Church of St Mark.
Local anger also mainly affects cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice has more than 50,000 inhabitants.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians expressed their opinion against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drive away the inhabitants.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will only be tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, the organiser of the demonstration.
The same is true, because ships bring the revenue they are badly needed in Venice and create the need for a large number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers will go further from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is also located, were to have more power to decide its own affairs - unless there is full autonomy.
In Venice, about 20-30 million tourists visit each year.
Are you driving in the Kuopio?
On the highway, the evil plugs of miles
The road between Kuopio and Silinjärvi on the north side of the road has had congestion miles from work on Thursday afternoon during the return journey.
In the area, there is motor vehicle coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is an hourly limit of 50 km instead of an hourly speed of 120 km.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had, however, actually advanced in places during the Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, road works progressed on the side of Lake Shili to the statue of Revelation, or the golden hare.
I'm gonna be fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published amazing pictures of himself in the Grand Canyon landscapes.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen in his current home country to become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because he broke his record of 400 metres in a run of 26 years old in March by touring the track at 51.81.
A month later, he improved his 400 m track record at the time of Norway’s record of 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media hard, soon found out that fame and publicity are in the shadows.
Men all over the world began sending Iuel pictures of their sexual organs, apparently hoping that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close off his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "stupid pictures" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to accurately identify what kind of pictures he received.
You must guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I get along well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, Father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2.
When Amalie was 12, his family moved to Namibia first because of his father's work, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship with Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask for anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's predictions at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fairway.
The left hand of the foot took the snowman Janne Korvi to the balance of his career in the World Cup: "Beautiful when nothing happens"
It's been nice to count now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, who is among the most successful snowshoeers in Finland, has actually managed to enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the career progression was at stake.
The foot injury had forced Korvi to operate in January, and the foot did not want to get any better.
The hand had also taken a hit in the race.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether the plate was going on or not.
The sponsoridiles were at a break and many things were open, Korpi tells.
But it says that things have a habit of order.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to pull back into the slope.
The decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I went first in the snow.
I was like, damn it, but this is so funny again, they're gonna pull through a couple more.
The korpi was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long period of countdown, just painless training has been a big thing.
Races The Korpi has only been touring a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you're in the heat of that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today, the korpi will race in the half-way of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races do not keep him on the board, in a tough company, he always starts racing.
According to Korvi, in recent years, the international ski club's appreciation for the races has increased, even though some of the board members chose the X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
True, in my opinion, the appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the races.
The Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-spirit team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pitfalls, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are Corpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow up on younger friends.
I remember when I myself was at the point where everything was new and so excited about everything.
It'll bring you a new stream, Korpi'll think about it.
There's still something I'm after, but otherwise I'm not, that's the amount of guys running!
In the background of the racing career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korvi has been attached to the horse racing: the rider has his own ravines, for which he does the training programmes.
When I'm on the trip all the time, it won't have time to be at the Mass.
But I look at at least the nutritional results every day and usually some departures, Korpi tells.
According to Korven, food control and nutrition training are a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed.
I'm not planning that far, but at least that's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it with a snowball.
I'm trying to keep the time nervous and develop, and in the summer maybe there's some kind of departure.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already finished inside the species.
The ravi affairs also include the Eltloppet-ravirisement with the entrepreneur Jaajo Linnomaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will head for the Elitlopet-Ravi competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Korpi and Linnomaa decided to revive the old tradition.
Crossing has gone well for business, and people have been excited.
Now we're already at the point where at least no bankruptcy is taking place.
A few months still have time, we hope to get the ship filled, the Korpi says excited.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-place care home for Kiteelle.
In the next summer, the building of more than 1,700 m2 of floor area will be completed on the other side of the health centre’s neighbourhood.
A general wonder is what customers are enough for a new treatment unit, as now during the war in Siun many private care homes are suffering from a lack of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Manager for Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand for enhanced service housing than alternatives.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought the private care homes in Kite last year, Kanervikkola and Eerikan.
The deal concerned business, but there is a five-year lease.
Flink says there is no acute need for Waitlo to move operations out of these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the United Kingdom General Trade Union (GMB) Department of Scotland, the company has not informed Tollcross of its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other manufacturing plants employ more than 500 people.
The company, which owns the McVitie's brand, Pladis, has reported that over five million pounds have invested in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will be "sure to be first" if there is a change in their activities.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to "respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines".
The GMB's trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that no clear information is available from the factory manager on the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The families have been working here from generation to generation, and the labour force has been strongly focused on the local community and Glasgow metropolitan area.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods as well as Brexit, rising cost of living and production, eastern Glasgow needs to produce a successful McVitie's.
According to Pladis, the head of the factory had received the letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company is directly responsible for the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with the workers and the representatives of the trade union.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed, among other things, with the employees that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we continuously assess all our business activities and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the information provider, in recent years the company has invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross plant, in particular its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to tell employees and union representatives if we intend to make changes to the factory."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrato
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on Neymar’s goal after paying the GBP 189 million transfer sum to conclude the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a pre-emptive transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most discussed case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transfers. The previous record was less than half the lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with the transfer sum of £89 million.
After the move, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, offering him over £500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious at the activities of the PSG and at the way Neymar has left the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players about the crowds.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're looking for our players, we'll be their opponents and contact their players," Al-Chelaifi said.
"We honor all sides.
But if they seek our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have done just this: it expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verrada was previously this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its star player Neymar.
The liquid stopped the stock exchange rising - Stock exchange news - Night-Sanomas

NEW: Trump's glowing calls were invented by the White House pressman, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, says New York Times.
The phone calls that Trump has made with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the party organization have proved to be invented.
The White House reporter Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
Sanders says that many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, had been discussing Trump at the G20 Hamburg meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard charge.
Those conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders' justification.
The speech of the patrols was a source of outrage.
Trump told me on Monday that the President of Mexico called him and congratulated Trump on the successful fight against illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few people are going to cross the southern border of Mexico because they know the way to the American border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release saying that there was no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump glowed his speech at a large meeting of the National Military Organization in Western Virginia.
I got a call from the bosses' leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the press, previous statement by the head of the organization Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked Trump to forgive the patrolmen, speaks to himself.
Mr Trump's speech at the meeting of the patrolling organisation caused a great deal of weirdness, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he glowed the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
