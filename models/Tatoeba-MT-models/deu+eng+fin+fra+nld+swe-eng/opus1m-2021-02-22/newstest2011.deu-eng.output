What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know either the full-time place, nor the "conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has once "kicked off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD as they master the notorical snake, which has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils have something in the dark in relation to these new terms.
At least that's what they're saying.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague politics," said Luk the new Councillor for Culture, Luk the Kaucký, to the test of the "Paten vocabulary".
But also Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golfhole".
"This is the only expression you present to me here, which I use over and over again."
"Otherwise, I don't like snake much."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June of this year before the ODS election Congress, the editorial office picked out six terms, especially those that are notorically associated with the Prague Magisterate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", the "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the canteens", "bare bites", "distrust of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth one - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the civil democrats interact with each other."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already pointed out, Lukka Kaucký had allegedly not recognized in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is the speaker.
Kaucky says nothing about the term "voldemort" and the only term he got correctly during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "golfhole" is then not only delineated by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Questions Lukka Plachý as a tunnel blank.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukka Plachý even knows where this figure can be found, and thereby what it means to "go into the bakery".
"I think, that is to say, to go into some Prague catering business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than being his own vocabulary.
In fact, there seems to be no similar civilized snake among the Social Democrats to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like this in us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called salopp "Hulda" by his party partners.
"At school I was called B the Bíza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see here - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party's "opa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by making his own decisions in the party sponsorship, is called "Igreek" by some colleagues (known Czech Lego-Figure).
In this way, nicknames are the only thing that the Social Democrats allow for the use of inner-party language.
Hulínský probably doesn't like it when you call him "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Nipple Right" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexes" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso as witches usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women also do not want to do so, as they help and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, published a brochure to prevent witch persecution.
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper pointed out the dilemma of written information.
However, witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Amy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them out with petroleum and just lit them.
The BBC server also reported about this incident.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "expel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Farmers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Zambian President has properly joined the President himself.
"After his aunt's death, President Yahya Jammeh triggered a monster witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"For this purpose, he called Shamane from nearby Guinea to help women and men who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, were violently kidnapped from the villages of Zambia and brought to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the incinerated people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An older subordinated man leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map containing three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment.
All three have just been increased in the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 Kronen monthly rent, the son is scheduled to take off the second category 4100 Kronen for a 2-room apartment next year.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove," he hints with his finger at the new lease of the son, for whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half-decided and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish a guide on how to oppose such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes a major "deregulation laboratory".
After a new year, this deregulation is in the vans of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG watchroom in Hav the city is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning full on this Tuesday break.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Miete 2011", a special keyboard lights on the touchscreen.
Just tipped and the device spits out a number tag.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and already peps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple entered the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance and similar.
From the middle of November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will let most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letter a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a striking theme.
Prior to the elections, Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years, I want a new floor of them."
"Not even a damn toilet glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the beginning makes himself air.
According to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to make sure that they actually receive the promised rental discount that RPG promises when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease agreement by 15 December are also expected to enjoy half a reduced February rental.
Until now, "Deregulation Switch" in Hav courseov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were here because of this," the callers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements both on its websites and on wallboards where necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rents, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least in part, gives her justice.
"I have 13,000 (crones) pensions, of which 5,000 are left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees become uncertain.
"Seeing."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they shouldn't sign and so people are waiting," she says.
According to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in housing in the years from 2005 to 2010, it is expected that it will be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the cushion armchairs in the waiting room of Hav the information in between appear a few red lights.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square metre per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices from CZK 19.66 per square metre," RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not bring the rents up step by step, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these are supposed to benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - the office also has a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a mini-child garden here, with all that is involved: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios come a whole number of renowned Brno buildings, calculated from the first drafts for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kinder garden.
In a wise way, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the designers will return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers have so much easier to take care of their demanding profession and child care.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The business mini-child garden is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (contributions of CZK 2.8 million) provided the necessary facilities and equipment and provided qualified staff and operations for a duration of 2 years.
After the utilization of the funding (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the Economy Rating company providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are fully staffed - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, at the same time only 5 children may be present, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexiblely aligned to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their position.
Although individual education and care are concerned, the programme content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, they are especially offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but is also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, so no stress occurs when the children are late from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-worker relations also develop here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi’s interiors
The roof mutes like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are broken fish muzzles.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, received the nickname "Knochenhaus" from its inhabitants.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's art style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colours and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that we notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the entire façade still acts more plastic, more dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and devoured shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even hatches and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which was executed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real estate owner were created on his drawing board, and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists participated in the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in Güell Park, where other works by Antoni Gaudí are also located.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gendering house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the Patron of Catalonia, is represented at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique for the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
A little bit bizarre already reminds me of her 45 degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and was not allowed to get involved in any of these.
Before the construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permission from the city, but the information he had provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers two years later were so shocked by the result that they demanded compensation.
Among other things, the councillors also felt that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public side.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's invitation to do so, Josep Batlló submitted an application for the lease of the two upper floors of the house - and it was given to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the 3rd floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for connecting rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably, without having to refrain from a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí’s conversion also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudí's play with light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is clothed and the light courts, is impressive.
The play of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited today by anyone.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to take this step on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When one found that this is quite acceptable business, one kept the visits, yes they also extended them to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the building monument, however, is not a cardboard stake; it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you would like to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the housemates and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the deck surface - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the specific needs of the user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the slumber.
Equally important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are subordinated.
A typical example?
Latex mattresses are not well suited in a weekend house where they are not regularly heated, as they need much longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilating channels in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture is present: so it is not impossible for them to form under their mould.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"If all hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here."
"For their injured shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these people with cancer, who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in cushion furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite easily.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, i.e., it really lubricates on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night one does not wander around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles to the height of the body, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each slug should be at least 90 cm wide, 180 cm together.
For single beds, e.g. single beds, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
The comfort for all possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," advises Helena Prokopová, the master of the cushions and room furniture, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years, and also presents this topic to specialist schools.
With a double bed each needs its own rust and its own mattress, but watch out for the purchase so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains but to mount the rust at different heights and that is not possible for every bed frame.
Foam rats should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three cm should be removed from the shape layer and the fine cushion.
"You can't feel the feathers by any means by hand or by putting them on," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Full-padded beds with mattress and base such as assembled siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and one cannot wash the cover, which is already going on and on.
And since one night one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a giant (and clogged screen) after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a life of up to 25 years in mattresses, and even a life-long guarantee.
Every thing's got to do with it.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not be shy of the hygiene of the washable, detachable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattressesaver, which one can easily remove and wash.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round zippers today, so you get two halves after opening (always important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, mainly executed alone, is often like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should use the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are already any in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a material.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice rusts with 14 to 18 spring strands (lamellas) and always pay off with a larger number of lattes, i.e. from 28 and more spring strands, with Lordose support in the loin vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the latte hardness.
Adjustable lamella rusts do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring bars, which enables the spring bars to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they enable the pointal sinking of the shoulder of the slag.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "herren mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers point elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torque suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to make the right mattress and rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Here too is a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it for example.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their interactions.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of oil raw materials, there is an increasing use of natural oils - such as castor oil and soy oil - to produce polyurethane foams.
Soya is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio means mattresses, which are core materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when sleeping.
Here, too, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the references to women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprika shoots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various stiffness (hearts) of cold and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to remove.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed less with VAT, as they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You can see that saving on mattress and rust is not so easy.
There are occasionally special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material tempur that led the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
This way it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure burn, but also generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as for special foot cushions, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, originally invented for car transport, can also locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette box but soon it shouldn't be bigger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and horror and so keep their eyes on the means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of damaging their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in individual cases, such devices may be misused, for example, if someone is put in his pocket without knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child is not allowed to wear such a thing, it simply does away with it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At first, mobile phones raised high expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
It admits, however, that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers positioning services for both cars and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, an angler is even integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," Mr. Čech claims.
In his view, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to record a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either devices in matchbox sizes, similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil says that, in the present day, devices that look like normal digital clocks are therefore tested.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he can only notice after some time what the police give a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of positioning function with the GPS system (as well as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, lit with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition string from STV Group, a.s. for Lapp 40 million crowns.
In its explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord each year.
According to the search of army pyrotechnics, the MF DNS responded, this indication indicates that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be the case for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of every new professional soldier, two meters of ignition is completely sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned - even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In this case, soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to the defense minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't know why they buy from us such large amounts of ignition."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as dealers would like to meet as much as possible," says STV Group Sales Manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition by the army that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible", one of them admits, but he wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service life, every ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition.
"They cost us sixty per cent less than the last year's 244 kilometres delivery," Spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: For several years, the annual consumption of pyrotechnics from the police, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Fraternal Army, has hardly exceeded 1,500 metres.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of their service life.
Even because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases is kept open more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnics, the MF DNS, in a few years' time, the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in terms of the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition, which they have bought today so "favorable".
So far I have been able to find the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
The victorious placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Luk the Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" was Lukka Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scene.
The journey of Pytlou.
Only abroad did he realize that there is a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
Out of the savings from his vacation abroad and with the help of a bank credit he created a building house with five apartments.
Thinking that he was a college student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio was annoying me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukka Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire profit into the house, which he then converted step by step to the 54-bed pension.
Since then, he has been able to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all types of accommodation in Liberec in just seven years.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"The big share of this license sale to operate hotels just had the victory in the competition "entrepreneur of the year", adds Mr Pytloun acknowledging.
The victory has made him more familiar, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me even afterwards and I have to say that was doing really well," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something about this competition.
You don't need to win at the same time, every sighting is good.
He says that until today he benefits from contacts and acquaintances, to which it would not otherwise have come at all.
"I maintain regular business relationships with some of the people I've met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also rests a little on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is granted universal recognition."
I don't really see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little bit in the foreground," says Lukka Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a calmer year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its ambition, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone company last year was awarded by Karel  the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury praised the efforts he made to stamp out a company from Česká Skalice's small tool construction, which made hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the battle with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, the effort was made to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel  the property seized by the Communists as compensation for a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company where he was employed until then sit down and founded his own company with a few comrades of his father to manufacture plastic pipes.
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the mentioned competition and its mediocreization that it also came into the consciousness of the non-special public.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensely, our foreign partners also started to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, adding greater value," says Karel  the company.
The past year, however, was not only a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And especially in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all the companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take layoffs," explains Karel  the company.
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get to grips with the situation and keep the company in the black figures, even if with less profits, than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to cut back on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says  the Swedish Research and Training Institute.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel  waterský.
An opinion poll that cleans up with absurd rules
The opinion poll on "the absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded in creating things out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online advanced.
So more than a third of less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will in future no longer require extracts from the trade register for checks of social security payers," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Bura the President.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take into account all regulations and regulations, to satisfy the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the absurd ones.
This year, for the fourth time this year, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German economic newspaper (HN) and is pleased with the growing popularity of the public.
Last year, when the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business.
"With regard, for example, to the number of income tax forms, we are taking a leading position in the world," says Karel Havl the Czech Republic's Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trade Operators.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, with eight worse places compared to the previous year.
The year's absurdity competition was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year in the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the website address is www.firmaroku.cz. The organiser of the competition will seek out seven candidates for the "anti-price" and will allow the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred have already been notified, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, are also provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to be paid tolls or that entrepreneurs have to provide twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at Wenceslasplatz in Prague is part of a Happening, in which people of political and public life are regularly involved.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trade Operators of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic were at the height of competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which make it unnecessary for entrepreneurs to make their businesses more difficult," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create foolish orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, most people disrupted the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the commercial office of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation has been abolished by virtue of an amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the Employment Office travel of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales standing in the room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to freeze fell.
A new category values socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The fundamental idea behind this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and that support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of Vodafon, who is the exclamator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this particular subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal were registered.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspiring and fines enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, disabled people, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, then participates in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolat-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a fund for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its health-impaired workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was honoured with the title "Responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia" and in the competition Vodafone company of the year she took third place within the framework of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, on the other hand, is located in the health of its employees and therefore it has bought them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work for its employees and uses carting services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to the catering, the way of work, the increase in their qualifications and the holidays," says Josef Strap the winner of the Moravian-Silesian region, Czasch, a construction company from Bruntál.
To the category Responsible Company of the year were automatically notified all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than August 15th.
False or incomplete questionnaire replies were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law enforcement companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition alone is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police at a public invitation to tender
In the ground fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police carried out arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was carried out by the detectives in handcuffs.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place to settle claims for restitution in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were of a specific interest.
It is said that Luboš G. paid half a million for this.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are following a person for the delicacy of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the "Právo" newspaper, who could not give further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In the light of the lack of official information, the only way in which he could manipulate public competition is to speculate it.
The spokesman for the land fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question that the police had actually taken arrests at the Pilsner branch of the land fund during public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms. Černá, the public competition had the correct term "invitation to bid for property transfer rights under the soil law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the property offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the invitation, a higher value than the declared property value of their claims to be compensated by the transfer."
"According to the offered claims, the order of potential acquirers is determined, and then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. apparently had information available to those who had applied for the invitation and since he was a legitimate person himself, having purchased a number of claims for restitution, he offered a land interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Apparently against a fat cut.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted by criminal law, because he issued land in replacement restorations to which decisions on construction projects had already been taken.
At that time, Luboš G. purchased land from the ground fund, for example, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access halls was planned to the Borské pole commercial area.
Later he exchanged it very conveniently with the Magistrat against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At that time the town hall had to give its own heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the properties.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
As of January, households must expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges and for district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
From January onwards, families will have to draw several hundred crowns from the wallet more monthly than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, some cities will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some will also cost district heating supplies.
Electricity consumption alone costs housing a few hundred more crowns a year.
The strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants.
Gas only gets moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, with a few hundred crowns, you can expect more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more for district heating up to 50 crowns per month from January onwards, more than 1000 crowns pay more per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are threatened by an increase of 9 percent in water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges should rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge increases in rental prices can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, which will eliminate the so-called rental regulation from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to have a legal interest.
The regulated rents paid today in nearly 300,000 apartments are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drown with distance and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Remote, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whiskey, which one stole from the housebar from the father.
These are the drinks that the Czech teens who are drunk must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep repeatedly in the hospital.
This is apparent from the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly tough alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, Chief Physician of the Children's Department at the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in taking a bottle from the house bar to the father, and if not, at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesman of the Departmental Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him permission.
"It's mostly about distance or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to Chief Physician Pelikán, 13 or 14 year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admissions.
Prior to the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars were delivered from nearby and distant students.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange at all, that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
In particular, the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in initiating their own offspring is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not concerned with real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"In alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chief Physician Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the spokesman for the Motol Hospital, about forty drunk children were sent to the local Department of Children's and Youth Medicine by the middle of November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police, after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink up a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three years of amplitudes on which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief because of the bad testimony or for the joy of the holidays."
"In Walpurgisnacht, I've seen seven drunk children in the recording at once," says Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who the next day has only to fight with an unpleasant cat.
The headaches the following morning, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood, without hurt somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who at least sometimes destroys the patient's good mood by listing the costs that it will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the life-saving car and the night in an acute bed come well and like on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this again and again as a means of education when I had to direct the children during the visit, which cost their drunkness and that it could quite certainly happen that they have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single one of these feet," added Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regres procedures to demand the parents' necessary costs for the healing of the drunk children.
Two L-169 training aircraft for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light L-159 fighter aircraft of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, were flown to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen during manoeuvres or flight shows.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are currently still in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she physically dispatches the aircraft from Vodochody.
In turn, the L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft were separated from long-term aircraft without further depositing and investing by the department of the Ministry.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in the current state and appearance," Pejšek said to Právo.
He added that the army would not have to exit without two-seat fighter planes, since the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four surplus L-169 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to force the fighter planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of aircraft L-159 and is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer, in what way he realized the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not opened a tendering procedure for purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of Casa aircraft should also have a judicial replica.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to sixty," the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick, explained.
The finger could help to determine which men should be subject to a prostate cancer test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger was shorter on the right hand than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and finger fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men by up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was well-known for this study, but he still does not consider the relationship between the length of his fingers and the risk of cancer "overall".
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and footpaths is mostly solid snow, the winter servants were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 near Brno towards Prague is also "stand".
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometers 91 one truck crashed, at kilometers 93 two trucks hit together, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the street grave.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have collapsed.
The riders were to depart immediately behind Brno at km 190 or over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
That's because there are miles of traffic jams.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several-inch thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns form for example in the city of Prosek, also the road Štěrboholská is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At 8 a.m., the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railways and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow confusion.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
In order to Vyškov three side roads are completely safe, in the vicinity of Brno there are some snow confusions and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V thekov.
Three roads are still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will have to use snow milling to clean up the snow.
When they are driven again, it is not possible to estimate them until now.
Caution is advised in the area of white carpathians in the region of Hodonín.
On the roads, which are allowed to be scattered only by inert scattering agents, there is a snow cover of up to five cm thick, led by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic there were between two and ten centimetres of new snow, most of which fell in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which has so far been known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power to their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precious cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain high explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic flight path.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinters from above can easily put it out of control.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does so: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise viewing point, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just needs to print it.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you press off, the weapon charges itself and shoots the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters off.
400 jobs are being moved
Fujitsu is moving its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move from the office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the industry giants specialized in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A Fujitsu speaker explained that, in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs in the Group, which had been distributed throughout the region so far.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the operation of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been only tenants in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt Lower Wheel we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt-based economist Markus Frank (CDU) said that this would once again have been a "global player".
That was a "great confession of location".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for low-wheeled people.
Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management about the intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the result.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacuum in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building shows up cooperatively."
Fujitsu's previously used house on the town hall square and the neighboring "Small Verticale" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new entrance between the railway station and the town hall was created, which caused criticism both for the massive construction of the areas used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still associated with Siemens, took over the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu-Conuzern, based in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, he provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more people count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions' subsidiary moves to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped plan - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics, among other things, has its seat.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is allegedly staying in England.
The WikiLeaks revelation platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who's on Interpol's cover lists, is supposed to stay after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks outlawed Amazon Servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists reported by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic dumps in order to handle the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks continued on the step: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks, after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had carried out research, the TV station CNN reported calling the office of Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Protection Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks," the Senator said.
Lieberman therefore called for the platform to refuse to use servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileak's illegal, unscrupulous and ruthless action puts our national security at stake and endangers life around the globe," it was stated in a message from the unpartyed senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on Interpol's list of arrests.
According to a report by London's newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location being Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fears his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the WikiLeaks founder will keep hiding.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a head of government consultant Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television that Assange should be "damaged" and Obama could "use a drone".
There was a stroke between the White House and Assange.
The spokesman of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "unfortunate and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent spying requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The American government now puts the protection of its databases fully at the test stage.
As Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed, the White House reported.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after the announcement of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to see ways in which the entire government can exchange and protect information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we could to get in touch with them," said External Officer Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the Gelatière and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat old-fashioned the ice maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The Gelataio brings the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the ice machine manufacturer in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses on chocolateneis and internships in the on-site ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture into the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, California art teacher, loves the slow-food movement and intends to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and after years he wants to take care of something in his own right in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano also doesn't forget in his training the cream hood of the national and even southern construction: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to the production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine a cock, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, base for all dairy species.
The lecturer is immediately challenged with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire to experiment run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who talk of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarnel flour from the guar beans.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then you have to sell it within a day, otherwise you can pack it together, and the customer bites on loud ice cream.
Certain variations at the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either in fruit baskets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice each - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The fruit ice is also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromas, more fruit-pures - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutmeg when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture properly enhances the taste of a Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a task: If peach-pures are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winders measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the computer.
Ice making no longer requires as much physical use as it used to.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mix is creamy simultaneously beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
All automation despite small failures do not stop.
The Brazilian Gustavo flatters himself and his colleagues from above to below with fruit puree, when the overdimensional bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Control in the passing beam
The European Food Authority (EFSA) was alienated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This suggestion is now formulated by the Expert Group on Test Biotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been in contract with Ilsi lobbyists for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA test regulations for gene plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, Den criticises.
The EFSA regulations were in fact identical to the Ilisi position papers and thus defy the industry's handwriting, which is actually to be checked by the Italian Parma authority.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech complained about a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking EFSA manager was recently without any requirements or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and so changed the pages.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed human connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as the EU Parliamentarians acquittal.
However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
It refers to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is stated in an opinion.
Experts working for EFSA do not require that they have no contact with industry.
But you'd have to disclose it.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any food testing and that the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice was to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which did not deliver any reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?"
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
Since 1994 she has been researching genetic engineering and is currently working at the Zurich Technical University.
Industry in this area, as in the USA, is now increasingly trying in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who have not been involved with companies.
For companies critical studies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls safety research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snows.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators were on their way and had begun to cancel a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar sinking of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in ruins.
Break in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They can't go away."
"A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought everyone who died at the break-up in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame to have them milled into gravel or disappeared in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bush that was once a watchman.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything about it.
And if it did, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were used again.
An average of 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos of squares, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also some in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
They have come from everywhere, and they have dragged away what is in the trunk and what is in the trailer.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mauerles" or into limitations of herbal bites.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"Don't be the political component."
He climbs in his field car, makes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
Jura he studied and discontinued, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
He gathers his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow there are artificially carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's whirling.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Beautiful Travertine."
Once the Quads belonged to the Tribune of Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were first cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he becomes quite awe.
"It'd be a scandal if you were to make such a joke."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and a sculptor, asmith, a glasswinder and a gardener have settled in the top of the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the rest user.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there too.
Talent fight for high potentials
There's rain at the buffet.
16 students press for salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen Autobauer invited mechanical and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are going to get to know Volkswagen through the car of the future in a kind of competition for ideas.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies now go into close combat and rely, like VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible into the hearing rooms before they enter the labour market and are being resold by others.
And since the universities do not publish a list of the achievements of their students, the exceptional talents in practical projects are being sought and bound up.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates more closely, and consider who might be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, as Selle said, are not unusual.
It is new that the students are so aggressively charged.
"The second focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the newly graduated will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to be competitive, especially with highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
He organizes complex recruitment events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the U.S. next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are cut and cut, the guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta the bill seems to go up.
"To this day, we have contact with all participants in a similar campaign last year."
"Some people are just before their graduation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buhlen at the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to Pirsch in a very classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Somehow on the Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonner Unternehmen has around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stubs know about the problem of young people.
35 jobs are currently available on the company's website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy stable positions."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact via the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced to the solar specialist.
The company tries to promote this with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This often cannot be offered by a large group," says Staff Manager Stubbe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good access to education are further crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among Germany's top 100 employers in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual Best List of German Employers.
To this end, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes to receive additional points from the job seekers from the placement.
"I think that applicants look especially for external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the German Employers Branding Academy advises companies that want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, the internal employer is called branding, i.e. employer branding within its own workforce.
" Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would be advertising for their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drills
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A ban on this has been passed by the government in Washington - and this has finally overturned its previous plans.
New drilling is still prohibited even off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Ken Salazar, Minister of the Interior on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the US's greatest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on supplies of oil from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not fully understood to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been called into question following numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the volume of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by means of stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", is the result of a current industry survey by BDO - before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will still have enough oil sludge in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to light up a boy with the loops surrounding him up to the chest in the water: In the rainbow-coloured water-gloss the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not visible that brown crude oil is floating under the surface.
Formerly she collected shrimps here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the low-flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipe a lot of crude oil poured into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours in order to get into fishing waters: the Ogoniland in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the world's worst-damaged regions.
On the way through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat stirs up brown broth, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees ripen like black liquorice sticks from the ground, sadly allowing the palm trees to hang their weeds individually.
Bird heat, as it is usual in wetlands, is sought for in vain: as soon as the outer edge is silent, the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, spreads forth spenstic peace.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darker: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield that has been under attack for decades: over 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe came here, and in the 1980s, with the later-executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, organized the first resistance, and the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is banned from returning to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable for the company.
All few hundred meters of steel, like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christboums" the heads of the drill holes are called much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most to the mark corroded.
Time and again, such a drillhead breaks apart, says Akpobari, then runs a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres of oil have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years time: every year, the amount of oil that hit the sea 21 years ago in the havaria of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" in front of Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing Eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group is responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution by sabotage and organized oil theft, environmentalists see bursting drillheads and leak pipelines as the main source of pollution.
Shell imposes significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner told the Group in 2008: "The rate of defects in the lines is "by a number of times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky from a distance, the mangroves appear: they are splinter-naked and oil-lubricated up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Gasoline first penetrates through the pipes into the intake pot, and later, at the end of the pipeline kerosene and finally, diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter diesel barrels every day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooks can still subdue the ridiculously low price of nearly 40 euro cents per litre: for their raw material they get for nothing.
It comes from bunkers that tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts in the whole of Niger, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small part of the temporarily stored raw material is processed illegally: the lion's share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and instils it in the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is due rather to the relocation of the population or the lax production mode, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as intruders and had they not destroyed the fishermen's livelihood so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni relationship to Shell was so destroyed that only a withdrawal from the Group would be questioned: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese would appear to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they may not be arrested, but be subject to a painful sluggishment.
The soldiers mainly from the north of the country also want to benefit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators discovered a possible construction error during the examination of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "disaster engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than they had known so far: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigations at the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published on Thursday by the ATSB authority.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce were concerned in 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
This includes the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a plea in law to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney which allowed it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the support surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil burn as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the super jumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground temporarily.
The Lufthansa switched off the engine at an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story pilot is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Landwide snow triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow has fallen almost all the country over the night.
There is chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures almost the whole Republic is snowed at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east are some 15 cm thick snow cover.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the ever-increasing snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting from the morning on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein to see storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal level.
In Saxony, snow confusion on motorways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather-central meteo media, therefore in Saxon Switzerland the alarm level was violet - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to traffic and traffic congestion.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to German Railway, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overcrowded trees on the rails or destroyed overheads and paths are the main problems.
In Saxony, long distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowwinds swept across the streets.
At major German airports the snow winds lead to numerous air accidents.
A number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker from the Flight Information Centre.
According to one Fraport speaker, 40 flights were already cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service was in permanent use.
Although there were only a few scattered passengers at the airport, they still had nearly 400 field beds available.
There were accidents on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The locomotive driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also recorded here on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing a smooth road with her car near Aschaffenburg.
The meteorologists have a good news, though: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will start to whirling in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be spent on the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its head office beautiful: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised, and the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes calling for a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale the spokesman did not call.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then to rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is already leaving its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and then thoroughly renovated them.
The energy conversion devoured the data according to about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers now renamed "Greenowers" in the newspaper is estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are re-sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is currently open, the speaker said.
Thousands of sorrows over dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the abandoned miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be secured because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 have been scattered under days.
A probe had been dropped in the crash shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be reduced due to safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the mate.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered on the South Island of New Zealand during the radiant sunshine in Greymouth.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were set up in honour of the abandoned miners, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates could be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing and surf boards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-massed.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "from the depths of the earth" back to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said about the participants in the Memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had not seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit, said.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial ceremony.
During the first explosion on November 19th, miners of British and South African origin were also scattered.
Rescue workers began to clear a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, it would start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
For fuck's sake, warriors!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is re-emphasizing old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience could Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with just one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torments and turns his opponents around with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rhubaric methods of killing and his enemies already rip the nerves out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Enauge says, as he is actually called, no word for the whole film, and also the other figures can only get to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and in the scaryly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematists with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been known since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to make his works available to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most artificial kino friends are expected to be deterred from the brain mass that is spraying around and from the guts.
The action fans will die at the latest before boredom, when the eye breaks up to Jerusalem with a force of violent Christian missionaries for freely interpretable reasons and captures an eternity in flute and mischievous, before the team apparently arrives in America and continues silently there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found any cinema rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-thirsty facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides itself, which deserves some attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogues or a tight act, it's all about atmosphere, a film-made fevertray room.
And from that there are no escapes for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but especially with the unfathomable hatred that confronts him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is loyal to the eye, keeps something like innocence, and everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who turns for enemies and temporarily ally at some point into a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who have already been destroyed.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and wonder.
An experience.
Ridiculous Earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is opposed to comment on this - it still allows checks to be carried out.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quadrant, hidden in a valley that goes off the river.
According to a briefing by the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s is hardly fit.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center Yongbyon.
She also presented photos showing the building nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was known to have been used shortly before commissioning, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than then, yes the puzzles became bigger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, there was hardly any evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "infamous reactor", even though they think the CIA presentation is "pleasible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diploma in summer only answered lapidar, the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The shootout of the so-called "unused military building" was quickly overturned by the Syrians and carefully planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium is from the Israeli weapons," said Damascus.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also prohibits the inspectors from carrying out a second inspection in el-Kibar and from accessing the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is silent about ironing.
"We will never comment on this," recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-free agreement in the area over which the IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in the enlightenment process, the IAEA appears to see three further facilities "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and different from the one still in existence.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations are involved, which function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and identified a masyaf building complex on satellite images, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this basis Syria of the IAEA forbids access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to dilute military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material has been transported and transported between the three locations and the quader at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated from it, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shot has remained.
The Al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has investigated in 1998 its suitability as a radioactive waste warehouse, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria was doing earth work in the three suspicious places and removing large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
It also says in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to safeguard any military secrets - only the effort to show how great the interests of inspectors are.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna were still appalled a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not in a great hurry, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the most stringent means the Vienna Atomic Agency has to carry out controls.
Although the IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than the prospect of an escalation.
On the other hand, like a diplomat, it says, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless debut in the summer, there is annoyance.
The script has written it itself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for rest.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is persistently in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's organisations immediately protested, after which some rotating days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile the film is filmed in Hungary and in post production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself ambassador of the UN refugee relief agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude to the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee relief agency, their organization recommended that Jolie be dismissed as a ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has granted a film permit for Sarajevo after a while - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself regrets that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict to demonstrate the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all sides involved.
However, the content remains vague.
For example, a second synopsis of the film on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp in which he worked as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the variant "victims in love with torture".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you may only be able to bring peace to Hollywood hackers: by putting the script, as so many before, illegally online.
Nothing like getting out of here.
On this evening it's finally running right around for the Irish.
No sign of fraud.
For this purpose, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cry for joy with loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Irish Cork is blazing because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, winning there are 500 Euro winning premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this clever drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse herself from the drilling question what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play games in Las Vegas, he will conduct applications in New Zealand in January.
"I have a muddy feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have a job there."
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had ranck, sock her wishful job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, predicted experts from the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
It is true that the forecasts are comparable to those of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity to the Irish people, sadness is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain of the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has so far only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are plenty of readers' letters from young immigrants complaining, "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses with it an entire generation."
"The last one will turn out the light, please."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future emerging, because the government only pursues eye-catching and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy on how to create new jobs," says 20-year-olds.
They observe how their fellow citizens hang themselves from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to take a positive stand on the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on working abroad.
"Work abroad is a great opportunity for starters to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, surfers show pictures in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gale service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has been knowing for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just moved up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his home country, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says when he first comes across the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a bit and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept courtyards, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 4 years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children that I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from anew."
The engineer doesn't like the agony he hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe this makes us feel like an Irish person."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how life works elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he already has behind him and why shouldn't New Zealand run well for him and his girlfriend?
There is one thing, however, that worries him in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could be part of a living-good party.
"Don't get too many emotions," he says and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Beautiful, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a go-away party, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demographic routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good atmosphere in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of advocates for democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse of last year, such a trend can be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents stated that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as much as in last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin American countries experienced only a short recession and recovered quickly.
Moreover, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America has increased only marginally in 2009 and again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see criminality in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared with 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents on regional level indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development; in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the USA as the most influential country, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A Slipper
No one expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electorate who hastened to help the poor country.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Electors opened with hourly delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless in January due to the earthquake, roamed around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some of the alleged top riders, demanded the withdrawal of the election results due to alleged fraud.
All over the country there were partly violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, described the election as "very good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, as serious as they may be, not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on December 7.
The expected deadline is January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, Rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no consent from the voters, declares that he is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 ballots needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot to play.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secret to the Center
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will help this with a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's election, guided economic policy, often drew up budgets which did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper last year, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disintegrations.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian struck another face and others accused the government of bribery) the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss it," says the President.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and union wage demands - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Censuses INDEC, which subsequently adorned official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called for talks between the private sector and the union leaders.
And, according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a large devaluing in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect financially with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the former debt of the country in 2001.
Fernández now seems to be pushing for an agreement with the sponsors from the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as was usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to them will be cut off.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide if she is quiet and silent about many of her husband's political choices.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan like about his big brother beyond the seabed?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, stood to vote for mayors and city councils in the five districts, which is regarded as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship to China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only a little.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual incidents in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with Krawallmakers, flag-swinging mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot him out of the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and killed a surrounding spectator.
Strangely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
Maybe China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed social housing plans and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, too, the DPP is avoiding the feeling of anti-Chinese too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on the other hand, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of its policy towards China.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
I'm sure it also wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since re-invented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was sitting in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he fought vehemently for absolute independence.
However, under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggles for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai, as presidential candidate for the DPP, found great agreement, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's proposed approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the Pragmatician Su to renounce the presidential candidature.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose for its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
In spite of rapid economic growth, many values are bad; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct their electoral struggle without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with their lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, one can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums, which led to a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positiotly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rousing favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The secret society of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-earned attention in the category of large group. He thus confronts Billy Children Emssemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octate, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is listed with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castroti" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choral.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu von Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsche Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daughterty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is dedicated to the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing with the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics suggested that the project should promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting started at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes distributed fairly evenly on both sides according to press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is in the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wished for a bigger and better location than the camp they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new Mediterranean-style mosque, about 2,300 m2, is to have two minarets and become about 13m tall.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien type of bacteria, which can live, among other things, from arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or Arsen."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists found out, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists must recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act on extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily determined," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to the high levels of arsenic.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behaviour to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that Arsen acts differently from phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it almost all fades," Anbar explains.
The researchers started the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing concentration of Arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based life form can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where the arsenic occurs more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But until now there was no working example.
Arsen appeared more frequently in the early earth years, she says, therefore science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when Unknown Persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 night, says the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are up," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still going on."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following a few tracks."
The dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found the vans and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were, according to the statement of the authorities, unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the pair from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxing cortex, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's salary. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's salary would be paid.
The lion re-wrecks after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparate" glass plan to clear the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the slightly-spectrated studio as the main managing director.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to around 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, an investment bank consortium, which itself brings in $75 million, is headed by the company. Funding is due by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Stephen Cooper, CEO Harry Sloan, was replaced by a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay out the studio's more than 140 gutters lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year everything began first, when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the company's management, receives a $4 million Success Bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder of which he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can pull a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, find a broader offer.
There are more and more button-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush characters, as big as sea boars who sing a note when you press their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, you can play a song through multiple pressing.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interactions like 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative hinge feet with wheel blockage, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, your parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires, with which a car ride can become a lesson hour, with a besserwisser with car correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvalue keyboard. However, the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), which after Leaprog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spell competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will get enough credit for two more parts at Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller boots or a puffle-stoff animal.
The latest head cell-powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a fucking garden.
And he's holding out a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived for some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are getting softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subjects and issued orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up to the teen age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"They look on average to me," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low stars: According to reports, in 2009, 50 officials surrounded an improperly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until it packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police force. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give a softer, feminine aspect to the brutal police.
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would not succeed in improving the poor image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the Hubei Province beat a viewer to death while filming her with his cell phone, as they sucked down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from a handful of brain injuries involving five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily said last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded "real thorough cleaning".
The current approach is clearly inadequate for skeptics.
When the district sought eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job ad, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with a good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, more than 25 women's work is physically too hard.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district officer at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Weird Chengguans are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but in addition they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of District City Administration, does not wish to agree to this description,
However, it admitted that in China, job vacancy figures for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether that is equal to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame people or buggers here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bowls and a well shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic glance.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to her, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply push dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes on foot or on the bike as possible before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've already told you this so often!" Ms. Xu explained to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20 who is studying in free distribution.
"Go to the routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
It is intended to protect them from public hostilities, which are frequently exposed to officials in China.
This year hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rang after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were killed or burned.
Xindu has been spared from such violence.
However, unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, gathered over 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired instead of in a workshop, contrary to the rules on the sidewalk.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a grim face took the road to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, remained behind. He turned his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, however, also physically," explains Mr. Li sober.

Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision concludes the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Up to the scandal that caused national headlines and dampened his career, he was considered a potential presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was delighted with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's attorneys, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and that no further charges were brought in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, helped with lucrative orders to buy his silence about a business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an Ensign election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton's work done. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobby work for her.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's electoral team, he was not allowed to take up lobby work for a year for his former employer or for the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on turn-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it all seems to be a deal and a violation of the rotating-door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the visor of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to state the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking up political charges for a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously horrific," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", an organization whose objective is to combat corruption in parliamentary and governmental circles in the United States), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was informed that the ministry would not bring any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as repeated in his office in a statement on Wednesday, "traded in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not happy to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to terminate the investigation for a separate action by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents violated the Hamptons' Federal Election Act.
The Election Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found Mr. Ensign lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton's company moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he "kicked" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also arranged for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
For the first time last year, when information about this affair was being brought to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and put his investigations in place.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal pays attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the roosters in the courtroom.
In a minute’s rush, they sent their reports of gruesome witnesses via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that got in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully persecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official ending when the verdict of death that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with a court that explains the reasons for an appeal and that will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process, including the extensive use of Twitter by an average reporter, has led to a "ircusatmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of touching details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public intimidation.
This objection could lead the Appeal Courts to consider whether new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced it during this process, I think it is really a danger if the introduction of the new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The ruling judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeal, briefly rejected the applications by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be "settled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court hearings have found that reporting of famous-infamous cases causes doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historical 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court annulled the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature movie "On Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr. Haye's sentence would look at half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at the Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who are presenting Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss over years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been prejudged already when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their jurors, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled them with horror.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he would have put undue pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a ruling they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-enacted the flames of emotions over the case.
"The lawyers wrote that such a day-to-day harassment of media spies, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," they said, "it has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are more uplifting than reports that are being refundable is a technical anti-technical view that undermines reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts would often be confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers amplify this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which repealed Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divider?
After a campaign of scoffing words and negativity this week, little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of real bipartite cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and summits of Congress did not break through on the major issues with which one had to deal during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which decisions are no longer taken.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party point gathering.
The public meeting of the President's Committee on Deficit on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological gap that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one calls for one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to balance the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting itself on Tuesday and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, be it temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers, are expected.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the NewSTAR Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112nd Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impermissible.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a prejudice, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
However worried the Republican leaders may be that they are too high in poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and put the health reform out of control.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, have taken up one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much for the deficit question to be placed on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their official recommendation plan and they fight very hard to get close even to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when the Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress-Republicers than at that time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure precedent for a more consistent election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that is being shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that the two continue to separate.
Swallowed US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are pressing for a high level of protection so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - takes its part in the money that the leaders are walking up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous charges of slander against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That has led to surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals should be named, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on second level."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men walking in the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of India, a Moscow Committee of Experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks in number 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "lowest corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause miscarriage within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a low-lighted concrete classroom with dirty and blazing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as the "slaughter", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of Khmer Rouge against the government, many years of followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them life under Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits even families."
During Khmer Rouge's reign in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok attracted the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run to the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some of Khmer Rouge’s elite officials held their local positions of government because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought for Veng in the jungle before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has not helped to alleviate fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district head of district in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the documentation centre in Cambodia that she had led the construction of Trapeang Tmma Damm, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court preloaded her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodsha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodsha must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Compilation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia", approved by the government.
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains leads to a rectangle of black Russia, covered with a rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman on the streetside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she'll be laying a bush of mature bananas - hoping that he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect weapons uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical element of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council.
The U.S. government had for years tried to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But the U.S. government officially told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (of 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said back then.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was lightly radiated, say official.
It has been loaded into a special train for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say official.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarus's under-enriched uranium research that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its warehouse by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
" Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objection by the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights to Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners via Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as is shown by a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid was accused of practices that are contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to secret flights across Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised", reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "will not give much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Service (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were incredibly concerned about their independence and did what they deemed appropriate", he had instructed his employees to "avoid blown rhetorical comments in order to let the tension fade away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, pointing out that the Zapateros government may have tolerated or deliberately ignored US acts that could have a negative impact on the US government," he points out.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "moth" of motherhood.
The young woman said about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she gives from a small point of view, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a girlfriend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are made in 2008.
To understand this, you need to know their love life, which is reconstructed by the daily ABC on the basis of witnesses' statements from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Teez, an industrialist in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never allowed him to perform a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she entered into a different relationship.
The selected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mad because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and let what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she says of the return to her village: "This week I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She explains that she will take her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him again with someone but with my mother", a doubtful intention if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expense for the baby girl."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail, you see, if he wants to, he's gonna find me like that."
On the 30th, "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
There is one from Víctor, her current partner: "He shoots me for money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked down, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a dedicated hunter, explains that he had conscience bites because he felt guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to Palma Provincial Prison yesterday from the prison for prisoners of justice on Menorca.
The defenseman, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of harming the minor."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes cast by this party in these elections is usually twice as high as that of the Catalonia elections.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, whereas the number in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the change in the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congresslors, while also CiU four (now has 10) would gain and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold its Member or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to the socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the city governments with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will not lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the main role in Tarragona’s revolution. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor, Angel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was also able to grow significantly.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers from the Barcelona Police Secret Service formed Thailand-controlled Jihadist cells, the different Al-Qaida groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attacks in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - supplied passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attached great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that the "operation Kampai" had been "weaked" by the forgery Al Qaeda worldwide and "so much as to be able to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda is formed, so that their "fighters" could freely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The revealed cell is not the only Jihadist network active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also contributed to the investigation. It is not to be excluded that in the EU area, in the coming days, there will be similar attacks to the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another was arrested in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijburmung were arrested.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cells established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourists passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In the investigation circles it was emphasized that, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", had not yet been able to prove any links between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, one of the groups of recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been shipped from a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement by Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, saw yesterday the opportunity to present to Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his assumption of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already set during the campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 members who won her last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to be involved in the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to enter into during the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC's party president, it calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and for an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque Country - to be put to the back of the referendum by the head of the party of CiU.
Both political leaders mean that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration more slimmer and to abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the entry into office of Mas are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) who will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old care home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Olot home do not rule out the killing of their carer over 11 elderly people
Yesterday the officials of the La Caritat old care home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they outlined the damage done by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had added to the institution.
Joan Sala, head of the old care centre, went to court, accompanied by his lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social dignity, because it had not established the criminal acts of the care provider in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illness.
La Caritat's head of the department denied this point and stated that "no remaining measures could have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there would be no evidence in the litigation of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The one who was already baptized as "Death Angel" confessed 11 murders yesterday and declared that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that access by staff to medicines was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from within by giving them bleach, as he had done to three women, according to his confession, whom he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, you don’t believe the caretaker’s statements, not even the number of alleged murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
Threatened by the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply to yesterday's threat to the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premium of euro-peripheral countries has increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly reached any point of concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses again, but as a result of the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity operations, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as these were ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least to March" and to maintain the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and to send a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if stubbornly insists that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB's meeting in May, where the Bank confirmed that it would not consider the purchase of government debt securities and the subsequent collapse of markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's national titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The government's asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the debt-hole figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time to buy private capital or these banks will be state-owned.
Although Ireland has completely lost credibility since it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still lacks sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is called for to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared with February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was rapid and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our indebtedness.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-sacrificing.
We would obtain liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be permanently closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now is not only about being, but also about appearance."
Just courage, we can do that!
Eulen’s Chairman of the Board, at the request of his children, is celebrating the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, the owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's nave, will challenge the El Enebro Shareholders' Meeting, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to give up the control of the institutions of El Enebro in his litigation.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as contested in the commercial register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which was convened for the 16th by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the Álvarez family's lap.
The Court's appeal to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "dangerous means of the applicants - his five children - in order to be recognised by means of legal findings, fraudulent acts and abuse of law by the assembly declared void of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent challenge of the congregation to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes in this sophisticated universe.
In the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer, and despite his steep upswing during the last season, everyone in the final track last November was on the victory of the Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in hand, thus creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, this is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industry department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that can be found on the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing venues, who were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bulls Team. They carry out analyses and any changes to the racing car with powerful computer systems.
The Siemens manager stated that PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend for its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that's going on there is top secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Other protagonists hide behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation on the race tracks, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is equally zero.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the field of R & D contributed 50 percent to victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, equity has changed, with 85 percent of the success of the technology, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "non-predictable gladiators".
HP will open its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network of between 80 and 100 square metres, consisting of 20 shops, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called it the converted store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, which has been cooperating with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She is based on a local distributor with experience and industry expertise.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for touching). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales point network intended "to optimise customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises when buying and then, yes, even the packaging."
Loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a link to the Technical Headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers, as large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'clave' its rivals in three years' time one million customers
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and in the prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to catch one million private customers in three years - an area that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700,000 if you deduct the customers who will lose the bank - that is the great challenge facing this bank, because it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the financial statements report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has upset all bank plans.
This year, Sabadell will complete its four-year-old Optima roadmap, which was initially designed for three years, but was extended by one financial year due to the market situation.
The main objective of the bank is to leave the savings banks.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola emphasized that in 2011 a "difficult" year would be "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slow" out of the crisis.
It would also be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if it is assumed that the war on liabilities - which penalises the margins of interest - will take place, the risk premium that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issues in order to maintain liquidity, as a compensation for declining profit margins, will already be passed on to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and will put pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday Banesto issued an order to its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the differential interest rates (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the Stategie "to increase fees", but "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, although the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "exorbitantly increasing" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from being cut into red figures.
He considered that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of capital stockings.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he repudiates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into operation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be resolved.
ECSC excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is restructured.
When the merger of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, rather it was an adaptation."
"The bulk of it is completed. It may be that we have in place of seventeen thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarieta stated that the concentration process "has been carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely progress that was established in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and is now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of inconclusive opinions about the slowness of the process, the unwarrantedness and nonsense" because "Banco de España warns us to conclude in due time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarieta assured us yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "possibly" around the world and added that those who doubtedly did so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that, in the current economic cycle, we have to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that is "immediately carried out" as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin decided to retain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It was anticipated that Merkel's position would not be an error in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is starting to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
First, a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutscher Mark - although that sounds more like science fiction at the moment - , supports by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third party: a reform of the euro in line with German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; penalisation of countries that breach the requirements; possibly the cancellation of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time. That is why there are now no excuses.
First of all in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew its arms from constitutional reform in order to prevent this from happening as of 2016.
This was the first sign of the confusion between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country on the table when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel is re-emerging with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be saved while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it is advancing the Irish crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, albeit sweet, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line which does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that, even if we now need to take unpopular measures, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from this date on.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area in which the countries which are being severely penalised will be forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand.
It is not just about reducing the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will go into greater peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should not leave the euro area completely blocked with little veracity.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game on November 23rd against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsports act or not and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several Fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the required penalty for the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without any cards.
Finally, the Disciplinary Committee of UEFA punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules, but followed in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who, in his hymn, proclaims the nobleness and honour and on other occasions has punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role in this, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a change in the rules. In fact, this practice adheres to the Statutes of Sport, but seems to bypass its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the competing players derive an unjustified benefit from the counterteam. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by miscarriage or miscarriage, because the bypassing of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a sanction, but should be as conspicuous as possible to punish it by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is, what kind of advantage the infringers drew from the deliberate fols.
Here, it should be stressed that the rival was neither brought into a more unfavourable position nor raised advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that his team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is clearly that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree unknown advantage, as the team could eventually quit. Furthermore, the players with this procedure receive a penalty and pass into the second card cycle, in which they quit less because of card accumulation than in the first cycle.
This makes it not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to derive the greatest possible benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a sanction (which would actually be a clear case of rule-by-rule confusion), they rather wanted to choose when they would be subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this issue is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics came from two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provoked rule transfer.
The damage that these actions have done to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar makes this year a avalanche of reservations to days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
As with the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas season that lead to Barcelona’s oxygen supply and leisure activities. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to catch up with the customer segment, which is the big mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the interviewed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13th, with the result of a avalanche of reservations from dinners on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners on budgetary grounds.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are demanded, confirmed by Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Barcelona Hospitality Board.
The representative of the umbrella association has so far not dared to predict what holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with "the quality offering at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls on us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey of restaurants in a variety of central locations shows that the evening of December 17th will lead to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demand for this Friday would boom with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which directs El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter of the year the revenue has reflowered and good, although the prospects for the Christmas business are concentrated for a few days.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends presuming Christmas.
Among the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more was added as a price hit. One has the impression that the customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, green sprouts are seen, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the rise again.
On the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with mergers such as Barcelona's pub, restaurant and leisure association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "living", although the customers "hit out a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, did not go back, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear programme is a source of great concern in the United States
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "quicker than any other country".
Disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of the glaring and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security is not strengthened, but rather "reduces" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster Rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored in their individual parts to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are noted by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear and missile programmes is no longer seen by the United States alone, but also by Russia as a cause for caution.
"Pakistan needs to recruit highly believed personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Office in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation is lagging behind and the increased speed at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on offers of assistance or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, South Asian State Intelligence Officer, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the chief military officer, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent over support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for WikiLeak's boss
Obama appoints a senior leader in the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about Assange's "revelation and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the latest revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australians have to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, states, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as on the 20th, the international police department based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to temporarily arrest and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many member states consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - particularly if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers indignant the procedure, who were writing a letter informing them that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder is willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions at a video conference.
She also recalled that Assange applied for leave of Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor, who was told by Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief Security Officer of Stalin, who received the permission to do so.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is paying dearly for her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indeterminate location. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State of the United States.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thereby violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation "unfortunate and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the views of conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and to prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, a consultant to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that had information leaked through in the government, he was guilty of betrayal, and all that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told the TV station Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get rid of for the twentieth time an internal riot in the ranks of the undirected ERC after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voters.
The party president is aware that his withdrawal threat is not sufficient for the former leader of the party, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. However, he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
For the beginning yesterday announced that the more than 200 ERC regional councillors could secretly comment on their stay in the office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penal code for the President, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subjection among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added that without giving a percentage, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Middle East calls on the President to make his office available only to the party. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of Congresses.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now until May.
They expect to be able to contribute to the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on 18 May.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, the party is supposed to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party top considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party president is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is to say, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a function.
He therefore called for a reform of the Statutes, which would enable Congresses to be held with elected delegates.
The Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the 2008 WCC mandated party leadership to review the general assembly principle at a congress that should deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still off, as the in-house rest of recent years did not suggest the approach to this matter.
Now, without the critical sector on the laurels, the time could have come to reopen this matter and close it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China's representative at COP16 stated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured him that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He stated that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He said that China's climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which will meet the targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities had worked with the central government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and emission reduction.
He also claimed that some multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those funded by other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which had been introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
A provincially-level project on climate change is also underway, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government advisor on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than would be generally accepted.
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they amounted to 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a total 9 per cent contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20% over the last five years and by 2020 is to be further achieved, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panistan party chairman had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right would be to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion had been Manuel Espino Barriento's right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right would be to him.
In an interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the State prior to the appeal, he stated that Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It's an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that he did not think about the time of 2012, and that an alliance to the presidential candidate never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a preface to the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore "does not frighten us the internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy them and they strengthen us", he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt select the one or the best president Acción Nacional would need for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the staff "to those who the Council would determine."
"I'm very careless and open. I'd be proud to take over each of the Five as the Party President."
He predicted that the Party's upturn in the last July 4 elections would reflect in the next elections, although "it was not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of demands."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's followers to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could express himself like those he could express in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in that country there would be no ban on the mouth and even less a censorship.
Obama uses the law to support undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short notice contains a cyber link to a more extensive document that invites the public to interact with their senators, since the vote on the law is imminent.
"With your voice we're waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was disseminated after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block any vote for any law, except the extension of tax reductions from Bush's times and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of Republicans in the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be completed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which will allow the legislative initiative for undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in that country and have been registered with a higher educational institution or with the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans to their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans in the country are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Senate Dream Act is facing the biggest obstacles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprach' was a walk in which the participants made a strong contribution to the storytelling.
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los places de la lengua', asked a cycle that celebrated the Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (on another event, the round table was devoted to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentinean writer spitt sweetly against the audience, who was mainly composed of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then the Shultz described it as a great storytelling. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive any answer, but points for the guide of her storytelling.
The infectologist leaves her convinced: "Trust is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who, however, explains that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst exposes the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and closes that it "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But it is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'the praise of invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story turned around and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning was not lacking in his own chronicles, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, criticizing the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) mocked the misguided witness who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even felt ashamed."
However, he points out, "is it the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there, reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations on which the FIL had contributed to the round table 'Der Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican people dedicated their contribution to the great wound of the social violence that their country is experiencing - like in Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and accountability that build up between the author and the readers like a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness of dogmatism also run out, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuanciate: Nuanci often means to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much better when thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the powerful ones who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end game also contrasts with two different styles, set by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinian has won the medal for the second champion, he has been a step behind the winners, and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to make a setback, as the game went undecided with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleven-meter he came up with 3-1 forward and got two ways to put his title in, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be once again persecuted by the accident and free himself from the evil magic to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, which is why the title will come to me, but what's happening before is the most important thing," commented the taxpayer when asked about the lost end games.
The last game has remained strong in his memory, he assures him to have learned much from it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the referee does not end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters already to get rid of it, and I believe that this is a teaching until the game is finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by an 11-meter shooting, does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at an 11-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to hold the title already in hand, leaving us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it won't come to this."
It is in Romanso's power to no longer be a second champion and to taste the fame the titles bring with them for the first time.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves to the visa application offices prior to their discussions at the consulate; the costs will be reduced in such a way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the Visa Application Offices (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their discussions in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant which are checked by the consulate before the conversation.
The new method has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will decrease, as it will no longer be necessary to pay separately the deadline, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter-claim of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa with a request (including a visa for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain there for less time than before.
Those applying for a visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay for the 26-dollar service surcharge.
More information on the new visa application procedure can be found at: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, Sweden, by experts in astrobiology, which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured them that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments previously considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent living beings, just like humans, if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it's a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that is considered too toxic for all possible life forms, as the lake is highly arson.
In some way, the microbial uses the Arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "it actually gives a different life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce at the press conference tomorrow, on Thursday, the actual reach of its findings.
The conference is attended by Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the Organ Law on Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and already installed a block of opposition, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves as independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Prior to the opening of the opening session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only Members who voted against the Presidium, led by El Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They went out of their political will and if they did not, they would again be subjected by both parties, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"By now (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into consideration the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there would be similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that the Congress should rule an eternal two-party system."
"At the beginning, this group will start with five Members, and they will talk to other colleagues to make them more," said Convergencea member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained, in an allusion to PAN and PRI, that the Congress has currently turned into a 'premium' for two.
"Previously it was only one party, now they divide them into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their place in the negotiating tables.
The five, which are currently seen as split up in different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because we have not been able to accept this reform because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others.
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check for just over 200,000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this was issued on an amount of 200.144.56 peso cheque with the number 9258447 last November with the purpose "accounting of open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent out that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells it at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to it and consequently the number of cheques still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought with her, just the debts are paid, just like with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year "resurrect": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is called into question by the ESA in order to avoid that other administrations request their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published on July 25 the examination of the cheques issued by the municipal administration to its suppliers, it was announced that from March 2008 until July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez had already paid the municipality more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they received cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourism places need to be improved
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán's tourism industry asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in poor condition and to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Union, recalled that on various occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and walkways would have had a negative effect, as the tourists would be sloppy and saw the disorder, and then they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work slowly and planlessly in this way."
Hotel owner José Ramón Mangart Sánchez said the tourist's fall would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance on the part of the city.
"The community has to take on its responsibilities and avoid this happening again. How it is to do that? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We look forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look uneducated and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions in the eye," he added.
"This provision has not been given enough attention and this kind of incident only represents what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and allowed a bad image to be created.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be put on the front with the city. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be the priority.
"Unfortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which should first be cleaned up and cleaned, to make them attractive for tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and has great problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members will exercise their right to act freely between the parties, because it is customary for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, which will transform themselves into carnival comparisons between the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the great challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to attach the necessary importance to the state budget in order to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second-lowest means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
It is necessary to allocate money to tourism projects, to support public security and to update the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to see dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes on the next three kings day, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat's goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they expect.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Some times hard times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell Mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the goers to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time already and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love this monster so much', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaacs has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is being sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region were carried out as part of the destruction of a network of cannabis production and sales.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly in drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security Police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom are from Sherbrooke, the main wire puller of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke as early as hours after their arrest in front of the court building.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Mr. Ruel explained.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estria of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be tracked easily
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be brought into line with all expectations after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly reject this Charter."
"I am holding a party that has put you at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session before the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows for the arrest for up to one year of any person who is identified as a seagoing vessel for the transport of illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian constitution of law and freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law as he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned away the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by means of a different draft law, C-35," Chow said.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the Conservatives because it seeks the blame of the refugees and holds children prisoner for at least one year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts that concern Canada and which treat the country as a footstool."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that the country could have led to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would call in a vote so that every opposing Member would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than just one.
It must be said that at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, this measure was not least discussed.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" and "a solution right at the end of the table".
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, had turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the present, future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University of Education for Senior Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposed that Quebec should grant a special mandate to audit to enable it to carry out investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec audit authority could give the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Penal Code in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This is the request of the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of criminal prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, that he is currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcyclists, 131 persons had been arrested, although the Criminal Code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall experienced in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were pre-emptively evacuated.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has sunk in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfalls of 40 to 70 millilitres have poured down on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall have been expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimeters of rainfall.
Since the snow melt which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is still to be added to these rainfalls, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinian mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation here.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefrat.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation most closely, says Security Councilman Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National High Water Centre issued warnings on the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maschinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupon partially justified
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CNNR) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his latent speech on radio.
While the CCNR is of the opinion that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have had the right to express their views, certain statements "had contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such an unobtrusive way of speaking, which is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion about suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistedes sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment were inaccurate.
The presenters should provide both sound and misleading information.
With regard to the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any blame against his person.
The final point of dispute concerned the statements made on the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media-effective dispute in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-moderator had explained that he did not give in favor of Haiti's help, because one did not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already withdrawn my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unobtrusive expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, had to notify its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, from Montreal, Algeria, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxing and in the Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges to the tatami and into the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the battle of all places, since for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security officer working as a security officer and the UPS company had given his rivals bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Cup of Amateurs held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact Kickboxing and Thai Boxing," he explained.
"At present, I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"It had been invited to each category of fighters who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I pray 2009 in Toronto Bronze picked up."
"In 2005 I became in Vietnam behind."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I was third in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fists and footsteps are allowed as well as ground throws.
The two battles usually play on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who has emerged from this type of martial arts is the Vietnamese native Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the friendly pound guy.
"It is a bit like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without a tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant 450 million dollars to project planning companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the main share, namely the project management, of a total of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to assume its responsibility to deliver this important, hydro-electric project totalling $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energy gérance" consortium attacked the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Québécois Party, recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition as well as an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded-out game and depresses competition."
"This means that, instead of playing cards, we are now carrying out in an open way instead of in secret form," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resource, had responded in the afternoon by vehemently arguing that this contract had been about a scheduled game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered, persuading that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "missing her hardness."
She said it was "the minimum" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is common practice around the world.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity regarding its scale of work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the possibility of a competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the model of the consortium is subject to government investigations in the field of civil engineering and consulting.
A short fly over the Quebecer business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of a lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of it there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the Énergie gérance consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'energique de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has let the fact that the contract for the project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this torture and say, "You will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that the price is not decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract, approved to the "Energy gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" numbered more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their branches, in particular resource laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Energy gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, which includes the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti Liberale du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had indicated that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed it" before she specified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-building
Greener, but unwound skeptical.
Quebec consumers have little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, but also little confidence in the branded brands or eco-labels to control their choice.
Too bad, although it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it only conceals information in favour of a more responsible consumption: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, a lack of sufficient information that makes itself known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they pushed the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products forward in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admits that the environmental commitment of companies is as low as that of green corporate advertising, so the measuring instrument, which is sophisticated by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates, which are allegedly added to the fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands which declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently invigorating about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and doubtless nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are opposed to the stated performance of green products and services, which they are faced with.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their district and promoted the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption this year had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as King of Recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left behind in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they have used public transport or preferred the ride centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Access and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent to re-reent to its actual cinematic function, obviously will not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering rather a bond lower than the initially expected amount, which could lead to a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the light of sources that can be removed from the government's rumour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the bitt request has been corrected since the resuming down.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris Act.
He had sent her a final report several days ago.
However, the Cabinet's counter proposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the assumptions of state donation seem to have been really sidelined.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have any financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not have to provide to other cinemas.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for more than ten years, director Daniel Langlois had presented the Kino in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulties, which could justify the exception by the State Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, drive a privately funded campaign, from which they hope to raise a total of $700,000 in order to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009 only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not withdraw the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the down-corrected suggestions they made.
Secret of complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomats, which were spread by WikiLeaks, exude the secret of what the United Nations finds to be the inferiority of Canadians to the Americans; but with the same blow, they expose the sense of superiority that the latter feels towards Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the Conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more pious details than the mere substantial content on which one has to nibble.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the Federal Election Chamber was in full swing, reports on the extent to which the United Nations is no longer participating in the interventions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian-inhabited minority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life much more than to postpone the United States in this election to black Peter (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the literal Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "hearing silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he said, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the process."
The other expression of this sense of importance is reflected in the communication sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa Business Manager, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's continued confidence in the federal budget vote at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a 30 to 40 billion dollar recovery program," says Breese.
He had never mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle hints of Maher Ara, the "No-Fly-List" or even discharges for the purpose of hearings conducted by CIA muscle prots.
Another in-depth communication tells us how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe is ready to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State in Puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let's note that the moods are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "transformed".
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global lighting renewal plan
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the course of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs delivered to the earth due to lighting, if the white glowing pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market so far, were replaced by fluorescent or better light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that would lower global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance sheet, however, it would be necessary to deduct 5 gt from the balance sheet in order to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With compact light bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reducing this energy requirement again by twice.
On average, the compact light bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the Philips manufacturer put on the market this week - this company, by the way, has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a whitish bulb, which conveys an indication of the savings potential of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that itese completely novel bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries except producers provide an acceptance centre.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-flowered bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power stations emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would gain from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects excited announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a UN Chief Press Officer.
"It invites all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight to pass three days after the election on Sunday without any publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday there have been numerous calls from around the world, but the CEI may at last call out the name of the winner of the second round of the election under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects to cancel "frauding" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebell camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire Presidency campaign, had confirmed that the United Nations-led manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's followers from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's claims were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of a view that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is managed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely related Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, judged the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results as he knew he had lost; and to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of a country's unification and reconciliation process, divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for this in case of riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA), in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is set at 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
In addition, 3.4 million French metropolis workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were able to work every two weeks or whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and on Tuesday announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region Council (PS), and was sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of general property, adultery, complicitity in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini ready to fight and intends to address all the questions that will be put to him by the prosecutor instead of spreading brain spasms."
"It's easy to make a number of criminal charges against him, another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) prior to hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the Department, had the honour of sending a memorandum to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers to justify him.
A member of the Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keep his deposit, which he had to lead.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the related funds, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne district, was also accused on Wednesday of contempt and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor took into account not to deprive him of his freedomů, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons had been charged and released from detention on the night of Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials from the Aubagne district, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Discharge and misappropriation of general property by a public service officer", the other on the grounds of "committal in the event of misappropriation of public funds".
The life companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and neglecting social assets".
Among the people opposed to Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained for a similar case of fraudulent public acts that had affected Corsica.
The Fahnder suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminals.
The investigation against X on alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation indicate that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions under which a site in La Ciotat is to be used for the procurement and operation of a site in La Ciotat, which also includes waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchman did not benefit from the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iranian detained in France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomat's telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way in which hostages are treated".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Powerful noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "innocentness", "sofortige liberation" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do so."
For "silence does not solve anything", passing the attempts at discussion over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in avoidance".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "Ensaling for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which was due to come into prison on 16 August, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that "will intensify itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago but is still detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition demands the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released from detention after a judge's decision in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American Embassy raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the Frenchman?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was "not only surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to resist it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister for Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "stronger" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-establishes, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently located in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe by means of statements and organized "flight attempts" organized by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and assume that manipulation carries fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25th, 2009 called up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On which so much "thank you witness" to Mr. Assad is based, the Embassy of Paris asks itself.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to fall short of this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria".
A policy launched in 2008 "was perceived as premature and undeserved at that time by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian Role Building" Paris tries to "involve Syria to see what engagement can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow conflict between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her with "of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything".
"But we did thank them despite everything."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a communication, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the ash broth", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, so interpreted by government officials.
A draft law to encourage online gaming operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, described by representatives of cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal day-to-day life."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games were then again available from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year's time to prepare for the application of the law, he explained.
The government also wants to ask the manufacturers to put down the time limit for access to these games daily to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the responsible person added.
He will also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events related to intensive internet use.
The country is also an uncontested champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the referee country
In bright excitement due to suspected corruption, FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the world championships 2018 and 2022 award-winners, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 FIFA Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its headquarters in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the level of economic and political commitment to a world championship.
So the actions behind the scenes are threatened to stop until the last minute.
Difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could equally well have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to win the World Cup one time, in 1966.
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday by issuing a documentary report, which involved three influential members of the Committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the British leaders, who had been primarily lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of Tony Blair's successful chess show, which in 2005 had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to revalue the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain Portugal is not lacking in drums with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the file (stages, hotels, transport) has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwarranted statements made by the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA-hot approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which will delay the Asian chances to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the prospect of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (due to the time shift), which is the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the open-mindedness
De Gaulle had really stuttered.
Mitterand had made him believe that he was knocking.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to act as if the doubt existed from now on.
On the one hand, as well as on the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him to make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening, in the Elysée in front of the UMP MEPs, he would give the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
It's far gone.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment restricts the number of five-year term to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm thinking about the next phase."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS earlier than accepted to exhort for the campaigning.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded directly and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were to find a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself in the open.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obligation, the central bank in Frankfurt, undoubtedly cannot afford to affect even today's more than tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to exacerbate it.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in resolving Europe's public debt.
It did not dare to say whether it considered that the Central Bank could do even more, for example by stimulating its government bond purchase programme.
"I shall keep my thoughts on my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at his hearing at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the previous day in Brussels, had not shown a great deal of concern about his intentions, but was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would be "extended" and that we will "see how the decisions are made" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury bond purchases were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is by no means questionable (see page 29).
The economists do not expect any remarkable changes in the course.
If more than three months' bond transactions have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to make a voluntary effort to raise the unlimited reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already insisting today that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the commercial bank's economist.
"A gradual exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Bräms, a economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its intervention in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that will revive the markets in question", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on euro area sovereign debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent premature enthusiasm for the yields paid to the weaker countries," testified a key bond holder yesterday.
If the interest rates set at the rate of rise, the Member States would be even more unable to reduce or stabilise their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government covers Italy
After a worrisome start of the week for Italy, the situation has been a little relaxed yesterday with the fall of the average interest rate to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, qualified the situation as "undifferentiable" and expected to hear it on a "unpredictable" weekend, but this was immediately denied by the person concerned.
In any event, on Tuesday the shere with German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the difference between Spain and German interest rates is 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as "heavily concerned about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, it says that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting dwindling tax revenues which put the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget budget for the Senate for its audit is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will remain 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9%) and 3.5% predicted by governments in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the upsurge of a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamental festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since, despite Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) smaller stabilisation progress is required than from other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political impotence remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised by the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it has been proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative, yesterday's deduction from the interest rates on European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about normalization.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt mark, which is probably the most effective target of speculators nowadays.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas's economist.
Above all, especially since "the political time passes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this is also the case with the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan is based on the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the cross-border market (see below).
As far as the EU stability funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for it.
The first expenditure on paper from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States with supporting a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
For its part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front row, are calling for structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will add to the austerity measures, but will show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid follow a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are at all costs to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they draw up their own budgetary corrections and decide on necessary structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalising government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the way through Paris on 24 November, had first of all raised the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back in its own pocket.
Barclays Capital's economists, with regard to the market for European sovereign debt, consider that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A council which has every chance to be examined carefully in the European capitals.
Above all, when the market conditions increase.
Snow and Glattice: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and are threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert because of the threat of snow and snow.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Metéo France, the intense snow showers strike the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, some also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is considerable enough to create traffic barriers and affect certain economic activities, says Metéo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic officers, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been removed throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the motorists to be careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% of flights starting from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in the south of London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, it is worth recalling the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP, the State has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to give a part of the financial sum on the markets to its double.
Today it has finally come to first reckonings.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was approved by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly on this morning, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These measures are twofold: the creation of a special tax on opening up and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to article 15 of the draft law, goes "wantings of the public-law establishment Société du Grand Paris".
This is said to be "the product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a re-ordination of the already existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase the resulting product and to answer this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not included in the text.
Of the 4 billion, you're far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital stock, which will be raised by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be carried out for the project", the explanatory statement is to be found.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for three years and then just draw from the 4 billion," it explains.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually withdrawn".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billions promised will still be available for a long time, is in danger of creating a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and eminent spies
The WikiLeaks business has a double meaning.
On one side, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's move forward.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi cast nothing further than what you got to read for months anyway in every x-friendly journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frightening caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists stuff for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will see that every work (through the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templar or the Rose Crusher) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (still because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
It's the same as the secret files.
The Informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only regards what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as those who had already published Newsweek the week before.
Why, then, was such a lifting of the disclosures of these files made?
On one side, this is what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have transformed themselves, with the exception of some small representation tasks, into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-friendly hacker can touch the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal affects the victims less than the "cutters".
But we are dedicated to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's times, one could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have proved to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control passage stops to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the janitor of the citizen - can get to know the secrets of the power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets be held?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, since it gives up the public sphere; but to reveal in WikiLeaks' style that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this contraction that has been added to such tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer put any reserved information online - this would be the same as an outlay glued on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is up to the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In future, how could private and only certain ears be entertained?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to introduce myself to the government's agents, secretly moving emphatically on uncontrollable march routes, hiding their messages nowhere but in mere memory, and moreover hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe bag.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate's spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today's technology is progressing like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the filmmakers to explore a film band for band by coiling from back to front and venturing all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays do not allow anything but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro-portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, and this requires three and a half hours by plane, including switching.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present it is the messages calling for confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France makes its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or early financing) realized by developing countries.
And already the gross French fine-speakers are exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, with France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU drew all the registers to convince its partners of the fact that it is committed to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation transparency is remarkable and is valued for its actual value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released EUR 2.2 billion, which will lead to the right way to respect its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort has been made, without overcoming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen as a benchmark for 2009: international funding is maintained and provides 150 million in "Fast-Start" funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of official development assistance.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the previous year's expenditure or at global level for official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France states that it will comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € borrowed as equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously this is difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to the reduction of emissions based on the most effective technology), it is misleading to present the euro that is accepted as equivalent to a donated euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the country of origin should be taken as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and donating 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU where loans are used to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including among others) carry out their 100% donation obligations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spend €1 to meet their obligations, France will just give 10 cents and understands a similar use.
Nice hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France succeeds in believing that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who conducted the arbitrariness) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (Why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole climate discussion.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense UNFCCC machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its method of booking for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed topic): there is no escape from the question of "calculability" or the method of booking of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive on the issue of dispute as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "calculability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Vereinigung Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed, do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problems dealt with", had, between July and September, usually bought the food consumed by a child of about ten years at meals plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as sewing operations by laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The plate balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 that are potentially or likely to cause cancer and five that are classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disruptor factor, according to studies conducted by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, this survey is very good at the conclusion that the reality of exposure of the consumer to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptor factor is a cause for concern," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three have proven to be safe carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, which are included in lunch, where the study has found traces of a highly banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the bush, even the baguette and rubber from pesticides and other chemical substances were sprayed.
The analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in tap water.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unladen.
According to the study, the final risk to the consumer of this "pollutant cocktail" is "probably undervalued".
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
