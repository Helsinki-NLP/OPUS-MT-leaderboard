What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know either Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new members of CSSD at the mayor's office will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily News.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argôte that was born in the last years at the mayor's office, when it was the partners of the current coalition that headed in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected representatives did not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a fast in Prague politics has responded to Lukas Kaucky, the elector to culture in the test of the "sponsored" vocabulary.
And with regard to the political veteran, the elector Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf-thru".
"It's the only expression you're suggesting to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the clay.
From the vocabulary, whose daily newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-Eectoral Congress of the ODS, the editorial chose six examples, primarily those related to the mayorship of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pasty, "beef nerve", "tragison of the capital" and "delete".
Three of the elected representatives agreed on the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has actually rejected the test.
"I don't take care of these things at all and how am I to have fun with the representatives of civil democracy: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we are going to understand ourselves in our programs," he replied.
As previously heard, the Elector Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that this is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing in Kaucky and the only expression he has guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucky and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language lesson," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy,the elector for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of going to the bakery.
"It's about, I think, going to a company," Plachy is willing to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexic of clay in social democracy.
"I've consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really don't have something like this."
"The names are said to be used at times with abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whom party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that, Karel Brezina confesses about the nicknames.
The current daily.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the party members or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scammers during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little jouleo".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow the social-democrats to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor en droit de matraque" seems to recall that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate as a doctor in law JUdr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorbents" and has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared to be witches have common features.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "sorrior" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"Neither are young women judged to be healthy because they participate in the work and give birth to children," says Burkina Faso, a sister in the capital of that West African country, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit hunting to witches.
The case involves a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warned Die Standard daily about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprayed at her.
The BBC server transmitted this information.
Criminals claim it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves the ritual illusions became inflamed in the woman's contact.
The oil exploded, apparently, when the team wanted to "run the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorbents" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia no later than last year even saw the President himself participate in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a large witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and sought black magic to kill the President as well."
"The shamans of Guinea who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen in the villages of the Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
Farmers had to drink plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: Poels warm up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out of the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a record with three new leases for three apartments: his daughter, and his son, who was serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second class apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works with solid fuel," shows finger on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I've signed anyway" he explains t move in anger and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the nouns as "imoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be applied for.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something" by frowning the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touchscreen.
A single pressure and a paper with a sort number of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrive to find out about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to affect people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - asking for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new lease contracts in their letterbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still going to be a test," says the employee behind the window after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former minor apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported on this in a fairly sustained way before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a well...no board in the toilets, they ease themselves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, most of them, according to the employees, are pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign it now as promised in a special offer.
The other tenants will receive a discount of half the rental amount that will have signed their new contract before December 15th.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really the answer to the questions.
"One of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG acts both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will take the decision.
'These are not threats, but only information about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', reports RPG on its website.
"No one will go to court here" one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and thus people wait," she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, "it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments with rents 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the upholstered chairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments".
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," indicates the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a truly very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that there would also be a mini kindergarten with everything needed - colour walls, imaginary furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children from Arch. design employees can go there.
The Arch. Design. project-architectonic company whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini corporate kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially older children, and it was important that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as working contracts are reduced, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.They themselves who have imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they have obtained a staffing from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Mini Maternity School is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (at SEK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years they were able to provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After using the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of children all day. Children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions but they are more than three years old for most children.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace each other.
School operation is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it involves individual care and education, the mini kindergarten program is comparable to pre-school education.
Children do not just play, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginary toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and have no stress of delay to go to a school far away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
Toe resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stairway to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname Maison en oss.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, here is all that is ypic for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The frontal façade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colours and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of shine of the colors is reinforced.
The coiling and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood horizontally copies windows, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, eyeballs and slabs.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia on the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, initially insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-family home was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade.
For the facade have also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park, where there are other works by Gaudi.
The premises named the house hot just after its finishing due to its organic forms "the House of Bones".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the house that leases".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with vents of ventilation and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination seems strange.
In the course of Gaudi's creation, the construction guidelines were absolutely not complied with and were not hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the municipal council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It was not, for example, pleasant for the members of the municipal council that the pillars of construction were embroidered on the public side.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo asked (and was satisfied) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is divided by a staircase that accesses to an independent toe terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space liaison.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high-ranking society can communicate comfortably or restrict itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional weed and two floors in addition.
The game of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the light wells.
The double-colored game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was only enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
Casa Battlo House, which was listed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative company and they extended the field of visits to common areas and at the grind including toe terraces.
The ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summier: women have criteria other than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and summer provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement themselves harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: the weight, the size, the age, the state of health and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you place the mattress and the summier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where there is no continuous sleeping of latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Molding can also be formed there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The person who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a rolling layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a smoky layer of wet foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore assume poorly "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with wet foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropic, for example, have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy so you can enjoy a wet foam.
This miracle just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
There's nothing pressure on you and you won't go back to the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The wetted foam also works as a protection against equator.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the foot length, which is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm size therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, e.g. single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Matelastics and Decorators who for several years has devoted himself to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own bed and mattress, therefore be careful during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the bed to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses should have at least 15 cm, of which the shape layer and the ventilation layer should be at least three centimetres.
"At the touch or in the seat on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a certain type of summation.
The bed-summer, when the mattress and the bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; one should not wash it, which is usually done in the morning.
And since during the night we usually transpire from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a large (and stuck) sieve.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to claim a 25-year life for a mattress or life guarantee.
But it's all for his own sake.
And for this reason, an expert advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, for the coating of the mattress, for hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with sliding closures for the whole, that is to say, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for the big models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a sommere?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if not available) with air hole and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slats with 14/18 slats, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate the rigidity of the slats.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses as it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special bonding of the slats that allows pressure to bend the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", that's really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for the "masculins" began to use a mobile area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface on the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet summers with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattress and bed, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm, which the Scandinavians prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow has to be leveled (with the shoulder of the sommer or the area rolled into the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards bio mats.
Raw petrole-based materials from which polyurethane is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of ball plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "refreshs" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
Current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure so more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattress and bed is not easy.
Special shares may occasionally be made by manufacturers or producers with two mattresses for the price of one.
Like Magniflex, for example, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn on the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The age of wetting or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
It began as a material for NASA because astronauts were experiencing the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur fell to the heat and hardened, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleepiness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use the EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear of their children is driving more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, put in place at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as exemplified by the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be of the size of a watch.
The case of the little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even though the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage, but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware of them, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are clients who actually buy the product for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don't want to be under control."
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
In her view, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"In the case of a prepared rapt, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As the tracking devices develop, they (the criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
It nevertheless admits that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring Company, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, saying that having such a device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The apparatus may be set up in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a specified period of time".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned shall remain."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slided and finds himself in an extended position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software program.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to that used in pendants of the size of a lighter box or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Well, he'll figure it out after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as tracking cars.
This is a combination of GPS-based position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could do the turn of the Czech Republic with, but it can only last for two years.
The army bought 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence had already purchased 224 km of it.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army has purchased off-the-shelf ropes from the anonymous STV Group for SEK 40 million.
The General Staff gave the reason for the purchase of a huge amount of MF DNES detonating cords that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the military pyrotechnicists, which MF DNES contacted, even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual explosive exercise.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could stay there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it were true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, only 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, were sufficient, this means that the army, with its new purchase, - with the consumption of special units and engineering - ensured reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head off if they buy so many detonating cords from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we strive to content as traders," says STV Group's commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of km of detonating cords have been purchased by the military for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky from STV Group reported only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnics of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can even go up to four years," says one two who do not want his name published in light of the army's criticism.
The past life span, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The Department's other argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's 245 km supply," says the spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the advice of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicists that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords in a more modern and reliable way.
the Ministry of Defence today has serious problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What waits in a few years for this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of detonating old cords that it today buys "at low price".
So far, I am taking advantage of contacts I have gained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of its hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner place of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytlou loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the thirteenth year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open 4 guest rooms in Libérec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was up until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he arrived at another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels showed up", the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well," added Pytlou with recognition.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have obtained it in any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
In his view, the reputation for success also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I observe at their home above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized".
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovaksky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crown business firm.
'I can say that the award has not only encouraged me my colleagues and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," says today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started to specialise in vegetable oil presses.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really start to get to know the Farmet brand but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not go to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the top of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even release," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that, from time to time, unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained beneficial results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, Farmet continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We have built a training and research centre with the staffing, strengthened the presentation of society in international trade shows and won the main awards in the national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of employees are rising, and with them the number of employees is rising.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that deletes unsanitary regulations.
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business channel.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
This year's low-glorious winner of the Absurdity Survey was the obligation to deliver documents to the offices that staff members can obtain online.
More than one third of the 4000 voters voted in favour.
For example, the social affairs authorities requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request an extract from the Trade Register for the payments of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even more popularity.
If the last year's 3000 voters have come out, it's at least 4,000 this year that brought their votes.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the business, and this is becoming more and more.
"We are perhaps in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the world's top places," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of terms and conditions for the company, which is 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the greatest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's last survey, it's a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their meaning of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees return two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins at the beginning of November at Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a happening in which people from the political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the peak of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stickers in the hands of entrepreneurs, and for this reason my aim is to delete at least three dozen paragraphs each year, which make the company difficult today', said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd waste is not a blow in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days ahead to the office for the individual company in the place where the company was located, the intention of going to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed as the Individual Business Act was amended.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the way for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in place for 5 years, is the category called the 2009 Responsible Firm.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair undertaking.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, Regional Manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For the first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition organized by Vodaphone, companies that have no success stories with a single long-term objective for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another, their support and forecasting activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic there is no example the company of Prague pro software and Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the leading contributor to the fund for the sponsorship of children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old Podebrad paper factory, which employs more than 70 per cent of the company, has obtained the title of Head of the Central Bohemia region and has been third in the region in the competition of the Year's Firm organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced to 35 hours a week on average and without, proportionately, a reduction in wages.
The jury also gave him the title because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports a dichoyan activity in the near vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration can have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the responsible company IT Encampit de l'Region de Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the shadow that helps the local Rome community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
Last but not least, there is also, for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravie-Silésie region.
They were automatically registered in the responsible category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and had referred it back to the organizer before August 15.
Malfilled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in lice had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organiser Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police carried out arrests during a public competition.
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in the last few days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and trading in real estate Lubos. G.
The applicant had endeavoured to handle precisely a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a specified candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for an iniquitous offence as part of a public tender and competition." said Pravo newspaper, the head of Plzen Prosecutor Antonie Zelena, knowing that more explanations are prohibited because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor 24 hours later.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, one can only speculate in terms of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Terrains Fund said that the police actually arrested them in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The Cerna public competition has as its true name "Appel to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is in place when several beneficiaries of law appear.
"These individuals, in the context of the appeal, propose a higher value of their residuum rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of purchasers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably got away from it.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards to the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing lands for which the decision to set up a building had already been made.
Just Lubos G. had, for example, obtained land for the construction of public communications, in place of where the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is very far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept, otherwise it might put construction at risk by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallets to about 100 crowns a month from January onwards more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more for the supply of water and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be close to 100 crowns per year for households in the apartment rather than at present.
However, all suppliers have decreased electricity prices due to the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and thus have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count some hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Prags will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
The Prague price will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will, for example, increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get sick with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer a fashion and is very gentle.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally the best whiskey brand are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks most often brought by those who are sick, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashioned because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a daddy's bottle in the closet, it's sometimes whiskey but it's fernet and vodka that prevail."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," explains the department head.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman at Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today, alcohol is fashionable, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought home," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department of Pélikan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he was doing ten years in paediatrics just where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the broads about completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park in a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their out of common tolerance to the fact that their rejections are due to the drink that is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to the experts, however, there is no mention of child dependence in its strict sense.
"The term alcohol means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that one is not found in children".
"As for those who use acool repeatedly, it's rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the Pélikan Department Chief.
According to the Spokesperson Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the Paediatric Clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a grâve of intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the stastistics.
Intoxicated children who are returned to their homes after emergency care by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan he exudes three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, St.Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Or they still drink after bad results, or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"Of course I lived on the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at one time," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the medically controlled detoxification hospital is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the day after the "woody mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend an excellent evening and then a sweet wake-up and nothing hurt them".
"They're only amazed at where they are," Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education, counting on these children how much their drinking cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to pay for a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover health care expenses from parents, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transportation aircraft Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of aircraft Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of demonstration exercises or flights.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that have been in service in the Czech army so far and were in flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Press Department of the Ministry of Defence, Vodochody's aircraft are currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft intended for exchange have been taken over aircraft that have been stored for a long time without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"Biplaces L-169 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He assumed that the army would not remain uninvited, since the ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 with a value of SEK 200 million for the conversion of four unutilized L-159 single-places into two-places.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the one that takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"This is therefore the case of the person who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that while the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought and used 72 aircraft in Aero Vodochody, 24 to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has lodged a complaint with the European Court of Justice against the Czech Ministry of Defence because aircraft should have been chosen in the context of a European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the calendar is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than their ring are less likely to have prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years," announced the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the calendar.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
However, in the case of those who had the index longer than the calendar the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk reduction was 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - includes different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that testosterone helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that he does not seem to have "complete evidence" of the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer.
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the time there was compact snow, the detonators worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 motorway in the direction of Brno in the direction of Prague has the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK) said it to the information
In the 91st kilometer one truck was hit, in the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles struck, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also in the pit.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th kilometre towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers are expected to leave just after Brno at 190th kilometer or go by Brno and then enter at 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A series of several kilometres of cars were formed in this place.
Also on the D11 highway, there is an accident and this is just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimetres thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, there are car chains in Prosek, where Sterboholska Street is also crowded.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between the Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is still meeting.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
Czech Railways have already had to delete because of snow 7 quick links.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but are increasing vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there is beginning to be snowfalls in places and on the road to Blansko chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov area has been one of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Buhdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowbreakers and strawberries.
We can't estimate when they're rolling right now.
On the road to Hodonin caution is rigorous in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, in view of nature protection, maintained only by the aspersion of inert products, there is nevertheless a layer of 5 centimetres of snow alert CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in the Bohemian north, with often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the area of Moravie-Silésia, it fell to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as the XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm size ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the target's contact but also at any point in their ballistic path.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel flashes, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier mainly uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise target point, according to which he corrects his intended site and supports the relaxation.
"Does that mean you've reached 543 meters?"
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, said Audette.
400 delocalised jobs
Fujitsu Group moved its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year, in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace which is currently located in the Place Mareinbader office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located in the Marienbader square of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße du Quartier Niederrad de Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 more jobs that have been scattered to date in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working methods of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "For us, Frankfurt-Niederrad is a crucial location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the airport connection is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a large company within the region was the joy of the winners yesterday and the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith regarding the place of settlement".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its settlement is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place will remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical" and the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
A joint project of the municipality and a developer of private projects created a new entrance of the city between the railway station and the City Hall. The railway station attracted many critics, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas used to be used in part of the parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the notation and investment consulting company Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt specialist real estate group purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has a lot more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This old 20-year-old complex, named after its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industries.
Server Expulsion by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks are experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the specialized site in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This may conceal political pressure from the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", on Wednesday (local time) indicated the cyber-activists who created the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Wonderfully, our dollars are now spent to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The CNN television channel, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The President of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in the light of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," said the honourable senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous way, thereby putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions against him by Sweden.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats against the site have been raised.
"Calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety," Hrafnsson said.
That's also why WikiLeaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief Government Advisor Mr. Stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a polemic arose between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the President of the United States, Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government now goes to the test bench completely to protect its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre for the Fight against Terrorism, was appointed responsible for the fight against leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" that are made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confisors are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the slightly demoded ice confisor, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making the ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, has it in the waffle and then starts to sell it.
To know, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorcerers founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that ice creams released from its machines correspond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered over several days. Practical sessions are also held in the private ice cream shop.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is pleased with the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a quality European product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in corporate management and, after a few years, she wants to draw a few unique things from this challenging profession for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the housewife from Canada came because her children loved Italian ice creams.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is not only good taste, but also smooth flexibility and consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he releases a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of ice cream with milk.
The trainer was immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact of being misled by the spirit of time.
One who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients", may have used stabilisers, but most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will crawl nothing but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
The master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to refil dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the fruit sorbet recipes with fresh sugar and fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added with cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts for chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and walnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the taste point of view, this is not absolutely better.
The walnut ice cream does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists of much of the nuts.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture properly increases the taste of an ice cream," says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if fishing puree is to be used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
Additional sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vine is used to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice available is beaten simultaneously to make it oscillate and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo beards himself with puree fruit from head to foot and, in this way, eclaboshes his fellow students when the control of the colossal blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "an incident like this could happen during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has centralized the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the test biotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a theory of conspiracy, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that Mr. Harry Kuiper, Chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, as well as other EFSA experts, are in contract with the Ilsi Group of Pressures.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr.
The requirements drawn up by the paragraphs correspond to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry, which would in essence be controlled by the authorities established in Parme in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking head of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss Syngenta agri-food group without any condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
Not long ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which raised the suspicions both of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and of Members of the European Parliament.
However, the Efsa does not admit that there is any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those from industry, are exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFTA are not prohibited from establishing contacts with this industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilisi) based in the United States.
This body considers itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, the field of science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagreed with the fact that genetically modified plants were accepted without any food testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment was not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize is on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we find them?" questions Mr. Then about an accuser's tone.
This is also the point of view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the polytechnic school in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls safety research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell has obtained about 400 kilos in total.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her back tube.
There was a manife.
He was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators had come and started to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the closure of the construction work.
Breached in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (Crailler limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and rough paved, badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap, simple and earthy rock."
He claims that by cutting it at the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former French army ammunition deposit in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a cabin, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the parallel piles of stone weighing an average of 80 kilos of value between 6.50 and 14 Euro.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to be able to do so during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Private.
They came from all over and carried everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"it was not this political component."
He enters his car all terrain, turns his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did legal studies that he abandoned, and later he began to study biology before he became interested in computer science and eventually became a carrier.
And a stone lover.
He's stocking 40,000 tons.
He grows up to be treasured all over Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refracting.
Sculpted sandstones with art are laid on snow.
They were part of the bridge from Marienbrücke to Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes through the forest.
He shows a pile of finger: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"You're a travertine."
The parallel pipe was once part of the Neckarstadion rostrum in Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved by simple steps and carts drawn by beef, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were set apart."
It has not become rich, even less rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people. Furthermore, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycling company.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save there too.
A wealth of talent to conquer the high potentials
The counter has a strong flow.
16 students are busy buying salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-eating whites.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen automotive manufacturer invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
In the context of a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in amphitheatres before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify the exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the car group brings talent.
A young lady in the staff service shares pens, candies and maps with Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
It is Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look more closely at serious candidates and appreciate those who take account as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're looking for to attract students.
"In addition, the focus was on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In sector property, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a kyrical candidate.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, shorten the highly skilled labour force.
These are mostly graduates from the engineering industry who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the engineering position vacuum will expand further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for KPMG, an audit firm, accounting and consulting expertise.
It organizes expensive events for the recruitment of talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they will travel through the United States in this way.
Participants may visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who is to participate in the selection shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only cream from many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we stayed in contact with all those who took part in similar actions last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon." he says.
Apart from the direct entertainment done in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises do quite classically by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in professional fairs."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Show," says Sitha Stubbe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company, located in Bonn, employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being challenged on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and takes a lot of time," he assures?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his or her project to end his or her studies at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced to solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stubbe, head of staff.
For a long time now, money has no longer played the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or promotion opportunities are other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he questions employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context, while looking at employee framework conditions.
The head of staff, Ms. Stube, hopes that this investment will increase the image of the company with job-seekers.
"I think that candidates rely mainly on external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies that want to build up a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, first and foremost, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to get attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When employees are well treated and identified with the company, they only advertise their employer with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a south-eastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government imposed a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains currently prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that has led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost eleven people and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow for new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, the supporters of this solution want to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in the Gulf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which faces several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry created by Obama must present its current findings in December.
In October, Internal Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze ordered after the platform exploded.
Following that decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been disqualified after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector of activity are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, prior to the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
Indeed, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investment in new support projects has been postponed to a new level, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is brown oil; it exudes a smell similar to that found in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmentalist calls journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil sludge in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man sinking into the mudy water up to the chest, as well as the greasy drag around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the blazing water to the color of the rainbow.
One cannot see that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that once she was collecting shrimps from whole sails here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil spilled from an oil pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to come back for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the ravages jumps to the eyes when you cross the mangrove marshes crossed by streams of water.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat finds a credinated brown water. Anyone who dives in his hand removes it from any oil cover.
The roots of small mangrove emerge from the ground like lichen sticks. The isolated palm trees sadden their palms.
The clouds of birds are sought in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a phantom silence takes place on this paradise of ancient times that resembles a service station by the smell it releases.
"What's happening here is war on the environment," says Mr Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: "our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni live is a battlefield settled for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered this area; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in that region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this society: While more than 2 million black gold barrels are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters rise in the water of steel traps like strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They're up to 50 years old, most of them being roughed up by corrosion to the benchmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres of oil spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the oil spilled into the sea during the accident of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental catastrophe in the history of humanity.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, oil pipeline sabotage and siphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, and environmentalists regard drillinghead explosions and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipeline failure is "alternatively much higher than track".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of fireplaces and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with fireplaces up to the neck.
A light sparkles under one of the many tones that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
We heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours," said Michael, team leader.
In the first instance, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop pipe falls and eventually diesel is obtained.
For example, Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira," about $22.
The people of Delta benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
This is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines in perce throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The organized crime networks, which are also among its members of high-ranking politicians and soldiers, charge the lion's share in tankers and arm it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to allocate the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no illegal sabotage,ft and refineries."
But in the meantime, Ogoni's relations with Shell, in particular, have been so dire that it was only the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you unarmed," announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the northern part of the country want to benefit like all Nigerians from the raw material.
"In any case, this fucking thing has dropped our country very low," said Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "reactor catastrophic failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to lodge a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had clearly had more chance so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft present a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible failure of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in connection with the oil pipeline, it is stated in a position published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
She could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
The reactors produced in Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft are concerned.
Quantas Airlines, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, are among these.
The Australian airline has now brought legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with a federal court in Sydney, Australia, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in respect of the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the carrying surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbs that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations were the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the Spokesperson of the ASTB, Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all parties concerned.
After the plane's emergency landing, the Quantas airline had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11th A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor by a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilised.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany happy: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per location.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but were unable to finish the snow that was accumulating.
In addition, violent falsifications have swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this tidal season to take place along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowstorms on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather warning station Meteomedia has announced the level of alert violet has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt country, police authorities have announced serious road disruptions.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls affected highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and north Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fallen on the railways, catenary or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport in Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds blew the roads.
The snowfalls caused numerous cancellations of flights at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
One Fraport spokesperson said that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoons.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was stationary there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car toned on a sliding shoe in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: Snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will turn in the case of slight falls.
But the wind's gonna get worse.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per location.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could account for up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just decorated the group headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and it seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as writes the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoting a spokesman.
This spokesman did not state the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings or sell them ourselves, and to re-rent them later."
For example, the largest financial institution in Germany has already left its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the two-way loans totalling EUR 272 million from the holders of the equity, and then had them rehabilitated.
The changes aimed at energy optimisation have, according to some indications, swallowed up some 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed "green tours", to about 500 million euros in the meantime.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the properties will again be sold to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people weep for minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried minors who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to lift up the bodies because the safe condition of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no traces of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors no longer had any chance of survival.
Until now the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends organized a feast in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including clothes and surf boards, also had their place there.
Flags have been placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at New Zealand's Memorial Day that New Zealand had been fuelling the hope that the minors would go up to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrence Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said that he cannot resign to accept the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescue workers began to fire inside the coal mine on South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter Film an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, " Walhalla Rising", created by the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of by shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) who has only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his brow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. It seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is in a bad mood, he pulls out the guts of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the castle says no word on its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the most, in the turn of one or two sentences a few horrible agonism screams.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the scenery of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for mature filmmakers who have an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relative to the traffickers of bold and stylish drugs, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial cinema.
Most of the supporters of art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads around and in the guts.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the castle goes on, for reasons that can freely be interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues silently.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that there exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a pulsating film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a proud dream transformed into film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a lugubre sound band, but especially with an insatiable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the castle, preserves a certain innocence, all others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into warriors, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rot.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at agitation, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrassing works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, even less to be subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it refers to the reactor that Syria has built, with the help of North Korea, in a stone parallel pipe, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of an electric current.
According to a briefing from the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be well capable of producing plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with hidden satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented photos showing the nearby building, or even the inside of the building.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, little more information is available than at the time, and even over time the mystery is growing.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an el-Kibar reactor, but had little evidence showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapon program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "summary reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "pleasible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Asked about the way in which he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat only gave a laconic response in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had " enough documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly took the debris of the "unused military building" with precipitated precipitation and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received, through a member state, satellite images from commercial operators showing the time that followed the attack, and it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them in exclusivity.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to objectively establish their authenticity.
Syria has always assured itself that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis by calling it unlikely.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as has about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the El Kibar site and refuses access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a persevered silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in charge at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never make any comments on this matter".
For example, the investigation into this case has been long since June 2008 without a result and it " increasingly becomes a serious problem of credibility for the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the nuclear arms ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that, in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the neighbouring cities.
Washington's independent Institute for Science and International Security has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly adjacent to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spying on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by American secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallel pipe in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production".
It would have no "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor will certainly work thanks to unreriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are at the discretion of the plausible assumptions concerning the following fundamental issues: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would later have been separated.
It is not known whether the graves, which could hide valuable traces, have been stored in all three sites.
Once hundreds of trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place where the graves are stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998 just a few kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analysing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken terracing work at all three suspicious and displaced sites of huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to avoid suspicions.
He said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time spent shows the interest of inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported on this matter, for example, says Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador, who has been referring to what has been known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already referred to "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalating.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "It would serve this, if at the end they found nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been a bad thing since Angelina Jolie started her career as a director in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a history of love between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
We know nothing more about this story, but that is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian wand during the Yugoslavian war.
The Federations of Bosnian Women’s immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded that she meet with the actress. Jolie is herself UNHCR's ambassador of good will.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a bit about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that the Hasecic organization had subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the status of ambassador of good will to Angelina Jolie.
But by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a shooting authorization to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that she has made a lot of efforts to learn about the Yugoslav conflict, that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: the lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves his brow".
That Jolie's movie started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on misinformation".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring peace to it: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything goes well with the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry for joy on the background of a strong music, they whip feet.
Baileyu-Pub de Cork in Ireland from the south vibrates because the players launch and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beers of the opposing team.
This strange show is called "beière-pong". The winner grabs 500 Euros plus an airplane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer player, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to turn away from the devastating question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The native country is so far away and I have no job."
Finally, her girlfriend already waits for Auckland, "in less than two, she picked up her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people go away: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even plan a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed a great ease, grief now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is especially affecting the well-trained young Irish people who have only had moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes wrong."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibility of it, is leaving and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave the light is out."
The legal student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws powder in the eye and offers no prospect of the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old student.
She sees how her peers cramp themselves with a practical internship without pay to another.
She states that her greatest concern is to emigrate herself within four years.
"It's a sad and depressed thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" show, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," said the manager.
Its website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just goes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, because he participates in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live practically anymore."
It bursts with a laughter embarrassed through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of great brands are parked on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"These were moments of madness, no doubt money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, makes hot tea and says, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even though everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"People must not suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as we have experienced here in the island," he said.
"Working for a while abroad is not what can happen worse, perhaps that is what we felt first of all Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back seven years ago and in Ireland life continued, simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes on elsewhere.
In his palm tree, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life in New Zealand should not be as easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that concerns him very much in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that she will not be able to turn into adieu.
"Only, not much emotion," he said while drinking a long bottle of beer.
"A good-bye, but it seems worrying."
"Let's call it a night to see you again, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it has been following changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements are from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after having suffered a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which means that the regional average is down (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their country worked in practice; it was the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in a sharp rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken up support for democracy.
While this has been a good thing during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again fell to 32% this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their loved ones have been the victims of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriated from many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disaster-stricken country in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were introduced, ballots were distributed in the goutiers, polling stations were sacked, and intimidations were reported.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, would go to the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually abandoned.
About a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and requested the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a rather good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have assuredly stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they may be, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, whose opponents are accountable to René Préval, an unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal to declare the vote null and void.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support from voters, is declared by the election authority as having reached the second turn reached the second turn.
With an epidemic of cholera raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the present case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganisation.
Almost 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, clearly, Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Mrs. Fernández's choice, clearly in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigentness of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost her majority in the Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank into disarray after Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peruvian movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the corruption government), the Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheated: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, gave priority to growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs that she wants to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previously forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its dues in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owns some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve supervision by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude to the sanitation of INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer with her side.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very promoted.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it has refluenced.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repel many of her husband's policies without noise.
Half a hour for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves on November 27, i.e. 70% of eligible individuals, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments in relation to the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. I passed the test, but it's just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which has focused on Taiwan's complete independence, has won almost 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including tapageous field trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal hold.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious killing was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, conducted an electoral tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot at the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had an impact on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates have made use of plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid paralysing its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from attracting anti-China sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation that his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilitation, in line with its strategy to defuse Taiwan, back to the background.
China has not lost time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let us begin with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the presidential election in 2012.
The DPP has anyway re-invented itself.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a promoter of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party has a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's premature approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems excited by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to break the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have trouble choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
M. Ma's assessments were weak; despite the vertigo economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his office and local antennae would be re-engineered.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of non-return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nomination: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
At the request of a president, people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist who was hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of the "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; which "sets the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", has certainly made a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line in Spalding compared to the fulgurging success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the category of "instrumental album", a broadcast on a refreshing frieze of a recording that was one of the main favourites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" from the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" from the keyboardist John Beasley will be in particular in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favourite ruffled voice of New Orleans and a frequent guest at "Treme" of HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; which also strongly fits into a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the great category; in competition with Billy Children's Rich Chamber-Jazz Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead the classic categories
Classic appointments for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the appointments are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees who have links with South California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in league for a reward.
Conventional appointments are divided into 13 categories, covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choir and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year featured five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The appointments for the classical album are the symphonies n°3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - l'art des Castroti" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the choir of the Marinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 had its first performance at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magnate of the oil Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" by Dorman was nominated for his soloist instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer from Los Angeles said he had written the work for 15 minutes especially for the interpreter at the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, received an appointment in the category of orchestral performances for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who have received an appointment are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harpiste Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only vocalist-solist nominates; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blends, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording "Backgrounds: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project gained the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The critics took the project by claiming that he promoted both terrorism and traffic jamming.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious centre was respecting local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, the Bahamas, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes precedence."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at approximately the same time speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another apes planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America fell."
The planned Islamic centres have also been protesting in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families co-existent without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet of Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
She would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe that tolerates the arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has double capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she is very special, even though she is far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report contained in the online edition of Thursday of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an alien life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the search team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and the biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; for example, they suggested that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, organizations have difficulty separating these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough so that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using the arsenic can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenal was more common at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she says; thus, the researchers have assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs from outside of a motel at Bellflower were found, as reported by the Los Angeles County sheriffs on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two bib pembroke gallois - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say that," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter located in Downey.
Sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and absent, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the coroners Rickard and Peek had planned to show off regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events planned in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a pregnant Breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and the corgis, thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit so dogs could get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported theft of the truck at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redo again, the restructuring of MGM no longer expects the final green light of the yard
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A New York Federal Bankruptcy Judge officially praised the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that some $5 billion of debt would be cleared; opening the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision of Thursday that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no legal obstacles left before MGM to get back on track under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors general of what will be a lightened studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is currently facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was hired to advise management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the studio took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, auctioning attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of more 2 billion whose creditors were looking for it.
In the spring of this year, everything needed to be done when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million success award.
Barber and Birnbaum plans to revive MGM's production, which released only one film this year, and to create an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must make a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful game is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic jumping strings of pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more force; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button pile toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable pile toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toy toys of the size of a pig from India who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure equals a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy more, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14 inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have tested the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with game cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve calendar.
If you are distrustful when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don't teach as efficiently as Explore Leapster ($70, for 3-12 years), it's the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for every 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and electronic books and has an SD card entry that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The aim is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the toys stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6-12 year olds) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit at Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last buttoned-ball micro-robot.
False beasts quickly move on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
She's also strong.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to order in China
Tang Shenbin was surveying a place in the city as an urban training sergeant by rigorously inspecting his nervous loads, issuing orders with a low voice with a military authority.
He wanted women members of Chengguan, who were public officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and for their inclination for violence, to convey some impression to a group of spectators.
"Be straight!"
"Be breakthroughs!"
Show them, he says, "What pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed the adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and identical olive-colored pants, were in custody.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, line-up.
Four well-kept hats perfectly perched on top of hair attached by a striped blue and white knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree.
Guangdong Province has exchanged green grey from uniforms for a blue, which is said to be more engaging.
Wuhan, Central China, replaced the drop-eyes with a strong one: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur reballed his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police with 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, bile and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties in attracting attention to this underground urban brigade in China.
And for a reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media are deceiving the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing's inspectors, uncovered and online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after an eenth polemic on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real full cleaning."
The skeptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a height above the average of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First of all, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "internal qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District Management Office of the City, does not adhere to this description.
However, he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial traits.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured persons should not apply.
"We can't let someone who's boxing or a boss come and serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apples with a finely curved mouth.
She does not regard the development of her appearance as gender-based, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a disapproved air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague, said, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to the fact that their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed on greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to restrict their activities.
Each morning, the team faces about a dozen ambulance merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many small breads or tofu bowls as possible before they escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu while a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-carrette.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than rigid.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, studying post-work marketing.
"Large routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to forfeit the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that the Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of placid square Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the face of the disaster, got on a road to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, co-ordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a delicate image.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li, saying a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the public starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign arising from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced the honourable senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential until the scandal around his case made the big national titles last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator may still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign stated that the Department of Justice had "announced that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charge against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have attempted to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, initially released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had assisted Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, in obtaining a job of profit lobbying to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the honourable senator's case with her.
Hampton once served as a treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a colleague of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for one year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to conflict with the so-called ban on the turning door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients for an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be distrustful of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its section of public integrity, including last year's decision to drop prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking arms," said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens' Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the honourable senator, as his office reaffirmed in a press release on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethics Group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the honourable senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "martling" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr.Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his fourth Republican position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to give a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and terminate its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were taping far into the audience.
They sent reports of horrific testimony every minute via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case and the children being tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end in which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that sets out arguments for appeal, which may be available to the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports about the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a "circa atmosphere", such widespread and instantaneous saturation with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by public passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this at this trial; I think there is a real danger that new technologies will be introduced into the hearing rooms, which will affect human rights at a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, lawyer.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, claiming that the media were "fully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Courts of appeal have for decades recognized that the media coverage of well-known cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's murder, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "Le fugitif".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue states that some appeal judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instantaneous communication from the courtrooms may allow fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who are likely to be discussed for years, which is delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr.Hayes would have suffered injury when Justice Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Peter, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been criticized by the prosecutors, and that he wrongly put pressure on a verdict by taking the unusual decision to make the jury deliberate in one weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of intensive media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of Governor and Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly attracting the flames of the case's emotion.
"The daily bustle of the tweets of the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their emphasis on covering the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instant news was more incendiary than the press releases sent more slowly was a luddistic view that would undermine the Court's policy on media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they made a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that had overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the cleavage closer?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a preliminary sign of genuine bipartite cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not lead to any breakthroughs on the major issues to be addressed during the session of the "boiled duck".
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the Committee on the President's deficit on Wednesday was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of trial and mutual testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limitations of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides remain at miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections spark partisan passions and then they disappear.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of "bad ducks", Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the meeting of Tuesday at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "bad duck", with the ratification of the "NewSTART" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely or even inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done will, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to meet their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes, raising retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes in committee, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the struggles between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the spirit of support for the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
Those who are judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at that time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties saw 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, this week's civility could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will need to be made by both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
American released documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin part of the bribery and the protection money it collects, reported the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge cracks that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes its share as money goes up the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on Wednesday on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been discharged.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still a mayor of Moscow; and he was largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interviewed on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unusual to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City Government and crime led some people to name it "dysfunctionual" and to claim that the government acted more like a kleptocrat than a government", according to the Embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the whole bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militia are at second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (instead of organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for criminal gang protection is no longer as high."
The note points out that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but has admitted little progress.
The Embassy's note contains records of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said corruption is inevitable.
According to India, corruption costs would amount to over $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The announcement of the note of the American embassy, which was only carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow hour, will certainly bring dissatisfied within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin assumed that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and responded with anger to the statements made by United States diplomats in calling for Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in that country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Red veterans forced to face the past
In an ill-lit classroom with poor quality concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng high school referred to the man who had built him, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality, when headed by the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-time loyalty was finally questioned in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum made it possible for victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual, which for the first time teaches the history of Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, led jointly with the United Nations, issued its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, condemning, at 35 years' imprisonment, the former leader of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or excess.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements came in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas of their base located in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red combatants began to defy the government with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been in charge, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer red veterans fell into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although a few Khmer-red elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are unqualified low-grade farmers and records.
"They received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed in the Utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer rouges as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The ongoing Khmer Red Court also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and chief perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he would go beyond these four cases.
More should be done to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations have turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, a former district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Tha Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, during a dry evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on an earth road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said she wouldn't go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who desecrated the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians objected to this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the government's first textbook on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of the democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the ties of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are distrustful because they do not know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance made the reconciliation process complex and difficult," Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black sweat, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in that place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place in Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to abandon its military-grade uranium stock
The Belarus Government announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, a key component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a victory over President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Hillary Rodham Clinton's Secretary of State met with Belarus's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way to a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an employee who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton described the agreement as "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama committed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
Some dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, Belarus's President, Alexandre Lukachenko, said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr. Lukashenko.
"This is our product ... We are not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came close to the United States a few months ago, however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated as the equipment had been lightly irradiated, indicating those responsible.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, reported officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"Comprehensive coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence," and leading to the agreement signed by Clinton," said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specialized in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of human rights by Lukachenko.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential renewal.
"In welcoming the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government has not objected to the CIA's flights
The government did not object to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda in direction of Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered (cables) documents by WikiLeaks daily in El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed "to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe which charged complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the government of Zapatero out of the way" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to flights of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken off," says Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, although, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González forwarded to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on flights from the CIA.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information from CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly among Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 for a lunch between the United States Ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if Spanish judges are crazyly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric by trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the work of the PP in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored United States actions that could be interpreted as human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she said.
The parishioner who went to confession complained about being a mother in the network of the "accelerated"
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician error"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she uses as soon as she was little, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both of them from Noia, the village of the Coruña of which she was originally born.
Messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Teez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was hiss, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring township.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to search the labour market, she stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, they are supposed to have broken up, separated.
In March 2008 she is in Minorque alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course he now realizes what means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to come back this month or you're giving me an address to send the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I will take him when I come home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until 19 because I have to go to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if it were all right, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him with another person if that person is not my mother," misguided intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When she shot him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and so I save a little money from babysitting."
On 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, going to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me from the money".
On the Internet it has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician error (epograph)."
The last man who lived with her, vigilantly, expresses his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was over so that she didn't tell her that she was a single mother.
Mónica joined the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, from the Minorque Judicial Detention Centre.
Counsel for office, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she also had no intention of harming the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and putting her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric trial.
Members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the 18-N results, PP could be decisive in Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already referred to the general public because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training normally obtains in these committees is the one it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan populists obtained 610.473 votes at the 2008 generals, while at the 2006 autonomouss they obtained 316.222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by the PSC vote diversion and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could have passed from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would also win four (he has now 10) and PSC would not lose more than 9 members (he has 25).
These calculations would indicate that Catalan space is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member - it has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal comics, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the populists agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the majority either to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this formation lost its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Ångel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important cities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by agents of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various groups of Al Qaeda, among whom "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the bombings of Bombay that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" has "been debilitating" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators estimate that the cell, within the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only jihadist network operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, participated in other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be subsequent attacks similar to that recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqr Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Sadique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the leaders from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which were hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the name "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that until now no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia we sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the integrations of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend the tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign and which sum up to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populists arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security guard who gave the fact that 18 members of parliament won the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make themselves loved, because the candidate for CiU requires that at least one of the formations the oppositions will not vote in the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the PP president, in support of an investment "all sovereignist and independent speeches should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converged to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common a stake in undermining the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the Mas Investment Negotiation will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatric claims that the dead were not due to "lack of measurements"
Owners of Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 older people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the harm done to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discretion that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a substantial compensation that legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not cease to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the dead, but given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an imprudent indication from anyone else but the accused".
The person already baptized as "The Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 killings and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him to die by injecting him an insulin sobre-dose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sediative pastilles.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the Centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes the nurse used to relieve internal suffering.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he has done with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
The Caritat does not believe the hospital nurse's statements, nor does the number of assassins confessed, eliminate the possibility of the number being larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the First Instance Tribunal and the lack of logic in changing how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available for justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threatened
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat of Trichet's yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have been closed to force and the shares of European banks have been more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to err, and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, in the same way as it does, recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank required the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving unlimited access only to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the sale at quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not complete the expected results, they will reverse the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, that God will help us!
Just as at their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even planned to buy bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday, the one-year trading auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the entire curve, and clearly reflecting on a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for the Allied hole and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a period until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem with the stress test in July, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in self-governing communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has been 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will be benefitted by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to apply for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available in liquidity, triple over March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except for being, it seems".
Run, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm continues in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers him to be “no law” the next 16 judicial council of El Enebro, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's holding company.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding company business services does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors it was excluded by five of its seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of 18 January this year whose challenge is recorded in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
El Enebro's Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by Madrid's Commercial Magisterate Number 2, reopened the tonners' box in the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict resolves, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "unfortunate appeal of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural arguity, by clearly fraudulent the law and by abuse of the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January," according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the argument that, once the assembly takes place, it should be challenged on the grounds that it is "no right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully when the magistrate convened an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requests the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive matter that the judge must decide after the hearing on the challenge request for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered Formula One's world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the ascending path of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without reducing skills as a pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, is mentioned the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In fact, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching goals from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this computer tool in his Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a short time, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals work with powerful computer equipment to analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the bolies.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull bolies except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Material, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and autoclave systems of high technology.
As the only limitation of this technological development madness is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolds in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that goes on there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty have 580 people, including two drivers, Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety null.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago it could be said that R+D's progress in racing cars brought 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by IT, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will report on this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as example the redesigned shop located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implant 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open doors were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the placement of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive shop furniture (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as the major companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers at its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's deputy administrator, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse in the margins of interest, which will be tried to offset partly with increases in commissions and in the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million individual customers within three years, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need to use the public subsidies of FROB, is to win a market position by catching a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can get out of the bank-, its great task to do, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-13 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, this year will finalize his Optima Master Plan, established four years ago, even if initially the Plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional exercise.
Clients who let the savings banks escape will be their main objective.
For a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years' time it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he stressed.
And even if he believes that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks pay for their issues to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of the differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the banking sector is now "increasing commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everyone will move next year," he assured.
He claims that the capital needs "enhanced greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
He also mentioned that the FROB could replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive at the time of the closing of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but, contrary to what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through rest, which reduces the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among caisses
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector takes place.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, one cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most were fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we would go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes were already carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," stressed the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast by the Association of Aragón Executives (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is being carried out "at the maximum speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being achieved in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he felt.
"The transition from 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an uneven trial in history, reducing the entity number by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of severity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who doubt it.
The manager mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that started a "very important" concentration process and "go at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has drawn from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin chose to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tension has led to a two-way government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of NAFTA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and the 30% of State lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How do these movements need to be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not an error in its policy of communication.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks it with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary strictness, fines to countries which violate them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been a long time since it was defined, so now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought had to be done (tax rigorousness plans and fiscal stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that point on, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and its publication were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, asking for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible for a country's rescue and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although somewhat ulterior, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the Union reform process which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely penalised, they may be obliged to declare themselves in cessation of payments, and in that case the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we need to follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater peace to us.
And that we can grasp the opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the way has been opened for the thesis that order must be put at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the opportunities envisaged cannot be ruled out from abandoning a too bleak monetary zone in less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and law fraud
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
In principle, the expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the League of Champions caused a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the game was over (which their team was already winning clearly), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator's role in showing them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory penalty during the next game of the barrage game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach, José Mourinho, and various economic sums for the players involved, with two games.
Provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not more frequent in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the related case is due to the fact that this has had as a protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn displays nobility and honour and who in past occasions has condemned his players to a fine for similar acts) and to orchestrated dramatization, he seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode of more to his dilate history of historic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether such behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, i.e. whether such actions constitute unlawful acts; for they are actions which respect the rules of sport, but appear to undermine their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporty mind.
One of the goods that understands the sport mind is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of these assets to which the correct game refers is to avoid that the team of infrared players is taking advantage of the opposite team unfairly, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of Real Madrid's action is that it does not accept that it is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in hiding to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible in order to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the type of advantage that the infractors obtain from the deliberate faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cartons that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminateness, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass to the second cycle of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the boxes occurs with a less than the first cycle.
Therefore, raising the ladders is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport mindset, but part of which is strategic decision-making that favours the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without dispelling the penalty or fleeing it.
Although the line between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The polemic, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: there have been two self-expulsions and because of how to transmit the director to cause them.
The evil caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to catch Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year focuses on an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and the lottery, when December arrives also the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but who due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive adjusted your price to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting complexity, this year's calendar (like the night of St.Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, having so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of the Board of Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer now does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who provide quality at good prices and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros became majority in demand.
In a survey of various facilities in the centre, the collapsing of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group indicated that there was an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete formulae from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al), the particularity of the calendar assumed more anticipated bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they explained.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Some sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the parties.
At their six group menus they added one for the Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a preposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, like Catalan wine made according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts the opportunity to start seeing the end of the tunnel and claims that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate as much as possible".
That is true, he says, hope for the festivities has not decreased, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the discussions and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security rather than increasing, "is growing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particular feature of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are embalmed by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack from the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials, including the short noise and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
The Embassy's dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", supports the following: "transparency is often absent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for Southern Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with the implied support of the terrorist groups".
Hunted by WikiLeaks Leader
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorism officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to follow the movement and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, if not dated November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) ruled the order at Sweden's request, but he did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the permission of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "in order to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Even though Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the Red Notice appeal a free way for the arrest -- which the police's national body must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is located.
The movement indignant the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, leader of the security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the Missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he does not keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they are experiencing at the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridicule and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should interest us," he said for CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the views of Conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them".
Further on, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went back on his statements after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should transform it into an objective and use an aircraft without crew or something similar."
A person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and a potential candidate for the presidency.
"The person in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with blinks of eyes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the first internal revolt within the ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this cannot at all give him any headaches that he had with other outcast currents.
That's why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new reviews with blinks of his eye that allow him to shield himself to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the carodists want to send a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half more one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand the president a little more than making his position available for the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive to a road map until May.
For this purpose, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council on 18 August.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in return for its promise to schedule the Congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of ERC has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its linen in the family room.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog results symptomatically.
Considering the ideology of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he pointed out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. to include new figures from the Carod-based sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC be liquid once for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
For example, he was in favour of a reform of the statutes that allowed congresses to be carried out by elected representatives.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought this way in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave entrusted the management with the task of revising the assembly model in a specific congress for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains incomplete, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at stake, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 carried out in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there were 4 cases down from 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases one mentions that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitilán, municipe de Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage carrier of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan turret.
Very early in the morning Thursday, the four, landowners exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots of fire in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the Villa Guerrero facility.
Close to the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day a 50-year-old man in Nezahualcóyotl was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a head-on impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec's municipe.
In Chalco, with the fire of grace in the front we found a man's body on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a firearm of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a comprehensive search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, the hands tied behind and the eyes tied.
The man had an injury caused by a firearm in his neck.
At half a month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán de Zaragoza municipality was reported, and two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the Los Reyes La Paz building.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrectible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan of the Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan, which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executors had left beside him.
At Ixtaaluca, with a firearm in the neck found the body lifeless of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces were detected with her image.
Towards the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the Zinacantepec factory with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head buried and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what is happening to those who are not aligned".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and attached hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the masonry of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cannel tape and a message side by side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a flaw with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured him that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and had maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, provided Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years his country has inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local governments to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various ongoing and completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, that country's government's scientific advisor on climate change, assured us that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he has shown that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to do another similar to that in 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP National Leader has explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to ask for what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is legal.
In the interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, if necessary, to make a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think in 2012 and there was never an alliance for presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez convinced himself that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elevate the top leader(s) that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the relief "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's revitalization at the July 4 elections will be reflected on the next contest, even though "this is not yet the time to think of 2012."
"For the moment, it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that came from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that they have been "a great deal of hope in relation to them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armor'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech in the National Auditory, because there is no bash in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes the law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call upon senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twittered the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call upon senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitter Obama.
Its short message maintains a cyber-net link to a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as voting in legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we're hoping for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush-time tax cuts and government funding extended.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs stated that he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, a legend can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic Majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in that country for the last five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's party organizations are actively lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the Indiana law, Richard Lugar.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they are not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of Language Fun has been a walk in which participants have displayed the narration
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do I hope of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Flaisirs de la langue, a cycle which celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (regarding another fair the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"...we are embarrassed," slowly launched the Argentinean writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what is the "plea", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolism is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "in the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very close to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez also showed a wonderful narrative he called Eloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With magical realism keys, he speaks of a famous sorcerer who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narration which then burns to talk about America, the great news that had his own chroniclers from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narrations of conquering captains.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way they would never have known the history of America with an imagination that was even lacking in pudder."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called in fact the 'Cervants tradition'.
"It's because of his legacy that we're what we're talking about."
In turn, author Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le moie sur la plaie.
Cuban-Portorican has turned its attention to the great scourge of the social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - in the fights of the tactic and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tactful commitment that is not, of course, premature," she said, saying that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that exists between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this is due to the plague of the hired writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "after every assertion there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also bothering the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has been able to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentin finished by comforting himself with the underchampion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Saniste strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament when he held the rênes of Morelia with which he lost a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, because his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalty games he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his tournament rival, therefore he does not want the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the timonizer when asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers much of the final final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the arbitrator whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot us were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game one cannot celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalty, which does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalty, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately destiny has done us a bad turn, sometimes it is emotions or anxiety to hold the title in our hands, hands he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be an underchampion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People must go to Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing process at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to come to Service Centres for Visa Applicants (ASC, according to its stamps in English) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will receive biometric information from the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with a request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for commercial and investor visas.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and they will receive their marks.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra 26-dollar service fee.
For more information on the new procedure to apply for the visa, visit the following page: http://mexico.usembssy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will impact on the search for living people in space.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 hours at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured us that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments thought uninhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life, and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce it.
The 60th had just settled in the Congress, when an opposing bloc led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo appeared, which declared itself independent and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'torn' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, 'bipartism' is initiated, because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by the Paniste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way they represent the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme based on political will and if they did not, they would again be served by the two parties and in this way the opposing coalition would end.
"As far as this is concerned (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political correlation to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, abounded the Convergence.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now turned into a 'butin' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the MP, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they will not be allowed to go through 5 culminating agreements which will probably be Members, now in the five we see, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mayor of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 thousand pesos favored Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palauos was issued by the Mayorate.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipal transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued the past 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "banking account vendors".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to that supplier, which was observed by the Government High Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palauos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the Crown, as predicted by the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not re-used its services.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques issued by the Town Hall to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 to July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the foreign tourist's accident because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a pit of the Sánchez Taboada circle, Mazatlán tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the image of the destination to be treated and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid the nearby trades.
"The politicians know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Mayor.
"The workshop will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that it will happen again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Mayor has to change his strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it doesn't just depend on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They were not given the attention they need and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is well known to all, the maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that have to get online together with the company and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly, and be attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Hardly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that we should order first, clean and put on line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Asks for Results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, has proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations faced.
Mazatlán's business sector is seeking a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was set up by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 members of PAN, three members of the New Alliance Party, two members of PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of previews that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat each other.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, has proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations faced.
"We hope that the Members of Parliament really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they turn themselves into a carnival mascarade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that are being made by the current Governor.
"We will ensure that they do a decent job, and especially committed to society and sectors, because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure in a way that stimulates the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is uncongruous as an important economic activity generating foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified as detonating tourism projects that are helping to give the state over-the-counter and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among others toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a horse.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, a 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspiration to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana suggests one-year-old clothing.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I said to him 'we will see, my son', because he was very dear", recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, is size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family dream come true you can participate in the On Suche King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
About ten searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in sites that allegedly were used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, silver and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Sûreté.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was the information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of illegal migrants' ships, is clearly going to be defeated when the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatief, when he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the proposed Bill, which would allow for the detention of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was facing the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected from the back of hand criticisms that his party is not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers of smugglers and this is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees away and takes children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling Members that they do not tolerate such illegal migration, which is a criminal operation that targets Canada and treats the country as a paillage."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
However, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who will object would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, contends that this idea is not due yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January of last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the pequist criticism of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "lapin out of a hat" and "solution bricolated on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, just say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the creation of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest does not want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To break this deadlock, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he says.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Carest government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be more responsive to this type of crime.
This request would come from Operation Marteau's prosecutor, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed to him that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit the motorist groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Highly supervised river
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has fallen on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There's been a downfall in a road.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy precipitation struck several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
Additional 20-40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of total rain.
As these snowfalls have already been accumulated in some areas, it is feared that several rivers will be drained.
Warnings for flood warning were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers in St.Jérôme, Laurentians, and the Oaks in Lotbinière, were subject to flood surveillance and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the spillage of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the spillage of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefrat.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely," said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Quebec River Forecasting Centre issued warnings of strong rivers for several rivers, including Maschinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially flaked Dupont
Quebec's radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his gross language on the waves.
The CCNR found that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the statements contained "unprecise information on social assistance, unduly negative representations by Haitians and gross language that did not fit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during programming between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the shared Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the program were inaccurate.
Moderators must present sound information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had estimated suicide to be a cowardly act.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame was held in his place.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then delivered to a media face-to-face that had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator said that he had made no donation to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that needy people would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, CHOI-FM broadcaster has collaborated "in addition to its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
King of the King-Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatami and the rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for battles everywhere, because for those who don't like the game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the UPS company just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur world championship in Edinburgh, Scotland from October 23 to 30.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing," he explained."
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the San shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where the punches and kicks, as well as the ground projections, are allowed.
The duels are originally performed on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pubist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the most noted and most prestigious in China, explained the friendly gallard."
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first half-final fight (80 kg) before losing to the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analysed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then, the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded approximately $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert Hydroelectric Project.
At the heart of this Avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained the most important, namely project management, for a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was created in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydropower project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Stewardship Energy consortium dropped the profit-making contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to price increases.
"This is the new way to make collusion and reduce competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing this in secret, now do it in an open way," said yesterday the pequist MP Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said that he was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting my journey," she weighed, arguing that the PQ had been "unhonest" and "missed rigorously."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a limited alliance over time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The site is under construction and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec Business Register allows for more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
So Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the James Bay Territory has been responding to specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a special way since the 1970s".
The great patron of the Eastmain Project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised the concern that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on a bid and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Stewardship Energy Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consultancy engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including ground laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has acquired 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting on his participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the QP is also linked to these firms that "finance it" before stating that it was rather his leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he swims in a media world where messages for a more responsible consumption shout, deplores a lack of credible information, because he even calls it a brake on his commitment, says the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they don't believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are environmentally responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speech on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumer information, however, seems to be essential to stimulate this share of current consumption by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and suspicious nature of information would calm down the fears of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are also distrustful of the alleged performance of green goods or services that are being sought to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to change their habits and, above all, to change the brand name of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from local merchants and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year -, the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint in concern about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they had used public transport or advocated car sharing to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which just took its first shot.
Government loan for the buy-back of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus and the Parallèle, agreed to collaborate, but on a loan only.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who were hoping for a gift of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard, giving him his full cinematic vocation, do not get what they requested.
The government agrees to involve itself in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least from the sources of the state's officines.
A first action plan and 12.8 million application had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who was driving the file of eXcentris.
He sent him a final report ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift really needs to be removed.
It should be recalled that the Association des owners de cinépares et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the buy-back of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of environmental stakeholders requested substantial economic aid.
For ten years, Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, put the author's cinema at his premises in the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is raging in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize his customers.
Angus and Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes and des diux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we are unaware of what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks take the lead on what the United States considers to be the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time they betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread over the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the midst of a federal election campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States is not one of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins explained the situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than have this election be made on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands, at least, that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Business Officer in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival at the early February federal budget vote, through which Canada will have its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan," says Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast to CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the removals for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates to the fact that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries for a greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) that is almost one third of the additional reduction required to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to make in Cancún in order to compensate for the lack of binding commitments by industrialized countries to reduce them.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global car park emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that would increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But this balance sheet will have to be subtracted from 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the increase in the climate at 2 degrees centigrades to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the remainder, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the need for energy is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves of fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country will make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and $8 million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants costing $2.5 billion in construction.
Côte d'Ivoire is waiting in the nervousness for the announcement of electoral results
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said the United Nations Chief Spokesman.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the deadline to be set for Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in order for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But camp Gbagbo is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of fraudulent votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, stated that the intimidation of voters in the north of the country by the UN had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who defy any connection with the ex-rebels, found the delay in the announcement of the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until claiming victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that making a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the lead of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan areas (9.7% by counting the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published by the Insea on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% with DOMs.
The unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points in one year.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further rise in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in metropolitan areas (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months and over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan areas (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemic on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was examined and crashed at the Luynes arrest house near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was examined for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, reed, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, reports her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is a combative man and wants to explain all the questions the magistrate is going to ask him, not fantasy."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders; he is another thing to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, to the AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guerini, a brother of the PS's strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, through his lawyers, had to pass a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday evening and crashed.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but make the discharges he had to handle work.
As for the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he never knew of them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne agglomeration, was examined on Wednesday for diverting public funds and complicity, and was released under judicial supervision with a prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client was able to explain the facts to him."
"The Instructor Judge took this into account and did not deprive him of liberty," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, reported the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "trafficking influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined for one for "deletion and diversion of public property by a public service mission person", the other for "complexity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "abuse of social property".
Among the people confronted by Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
The investigators suspect that their societies have served to launder the money of great banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a La Ciotat landfill, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in Haline in France, put diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going up to giving them advice on the treatment of their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchman had not, in return, had the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée Councillor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own law enforcement nationals to Iran.
"Does sound," they say, "complain constantly" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocentness", "immediate release".
It is necessary in order to contain the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
The Iranians are "masters of dilatory manoeuvres" because, through attempts at discussion by discreet channels, "silence will not work," the Iranians are "masters of dilatory manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will intervene on 16 August, the day it takes refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require a large amount of money to be paid to Iranians" (230 000 euros of bail).
And he says that Elysea anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. claims extradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian underground equipment acquisition networks for the nuclear programme, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted a merchanting?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he says, has not only "been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot come back to the decision", he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée's advisor consists of a phone number, pick up, and then inform the American diplomat that Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through press releases and "runs" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and notice that manipulation is bearing fruit as several press articles impact the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media flash" of French officials.
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, questions the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their words of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "vises validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived as premature and unmerited by many critical voices in France and abroad".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord seeds between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "We certainly do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we still thanked them."
"It should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a press release, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans passed midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Ministerial Manager in charge of the bill.
Online games will again be available at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents are applying for them, adding the person responsible.
It will also make available people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the unquestioned champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: FIFA refers to the host countries
On Thursday, because of suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates the World Cup organizer countries 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where struggles for influence and lobbying may take a step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen Competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities among the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides a measure of the economic and political challenges of a world.
Traces in behind the scenes are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations which led to the suspension of corruption by two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which welcomed the World only once in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that spans three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What dissatisfied the FIFA and embarrassed the English leaders, who have started an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the JO-2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to bring England's bladder back to the EC?
Nothing is any less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Global-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could bring their ambitions to light.
Any reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, which has become a weighty outsider despite the shortcomings in its file (stads, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" in a barely veiled reference to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the USA, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favors.
The world's leading economic power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, seems to have a long lead over Japan and South Korea, which have built a very nice project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World 2026 to China, a great deal wanted by the FIFA, which would in fact undermine the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new areas, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the television rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate for the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not clean well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then it must be done as if doubt always existed.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that he would make his decision "someway in the fall of 2011".
He referred to the prospect of "two mandates" in front of UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at Elysée, so a bit of febricity was seen.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of quinquennates to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentions the presidential, about the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the next step."
His statements earlier yesterday did not make him more candidate than the day before; they did not make him less.
If they raise comments, it is for a double reason.
Acceleration of the competition at the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entrance to the lice of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is obvious that many of the PS are calling for an early battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who was clearly resigned.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that Frankfurt's issuing institution may not be able to afford to be as durable as it might be to worsen a situation that is more tense today in European bond markets.
Political costs would be all the greater.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the ECB's active role in the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The day before the hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, in Brussels, did not appear to be more dissatisfied with his intentions, merely pointing out that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of further procurement (see page 29).
The economists also do not expect a significant change in course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB will continue to make unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists now expect this arrangement to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
"If this would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to host an atone market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of the yields paid by the most fragile states," testified a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly away, the States will be particularly bothered to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrisome start of the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a little, yesterday, with the reflow of bond rates to 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
At a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Mr. Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecisible" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the individual subsequently denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German long rates had reached the 210 basis points record and the price of cover contracts against bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to a certain affluence in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said "strongly concerned" with "market turbulence" and with a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonia of tax returns that goes along with, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget in the Senate is set at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be set up after the holidays, for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from the international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator to the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required in Italy are smaller than those requested in other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up an unfavorable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crime mechanisms
Christine Lagarde again tortured him yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it has been demonstrated yet Sunday and night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although anything relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about a beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas's economists.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it presents, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-oriental investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries which are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both of them want to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the necessary structural reforms to restore confidence in the long term.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advance in the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over its hand to the portfolio.
Barclays Capital's economists, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 orange watch departments
Snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later at night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm on time, are expected for the relevant departments, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The relevant departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Du Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are sufficiently significant to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Meteo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned for heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take their vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some cars TER has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
Civil Aviation Branch (CGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, the billions have been full.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is referred to for the Grand Paris Metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop in the markets.
Today we finally arrive at the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first one, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It reads as follows: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernise it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mysterious.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from $4 billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project takes place," can be read in the explanatory memorandum.
At the SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the moment you create revenue (both taxes, ndlr), you can cover the three-year studies and then tap within the 4 billion years after, we explain."
"This will be included in the budget and drawn from time to time".
The GPS estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, could lead to a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Vengeance hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, there is an apparent scandal, a scandal which only appears as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read for months in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Khadafi's caricatural disaster profile has long been for cabaret-material-skatch artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (don't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reassert what they had already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) the chief of secret services (if not, as I know, editor of Liberation), who holds only as true as he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as that that Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the disclosures on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representation exercises, have become spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under the wrong light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is taking a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal doesn't put both the victims and the "strikes" in crisis.
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved to be complete since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eyes of power.
But when one shows, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control ratio ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's revenge - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is within the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future the States will no longer be able to publish any reserved information - this would be to publish it on a sticky poster at the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to be able to maintain confidential telephone relations.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved in and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction falls within the realm of science fiction and is, therefore, romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence on uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in closed drawers with key: in the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving into crab, that is to say, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wires (telephonic).
Video cassettes (analogues) had allowed cinematographers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the installation, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the travel that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques should return to horse-riding cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand the secret of embassies.
Embassies are now requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France embarrasses its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly released financing (fast start or early funding) made by the developed countries.
And the big French dolls are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out of the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large-scale event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has raised EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which sets it on track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at things in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be "new and additional", according to the Copenhagen agreement, in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and it adds 150 million over three years for fast-start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures from previous years or at the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each one chooses his or her method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that a loan of €1 is equal to a given one.
Of course, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given ... At the most, should be counted on its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France only has such a reasoning: it 'respects' its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document for verification by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (otherwise) respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-by!
In summary, France, in its fast-start financing, is operating a double scam: on the one hand, the evolution of action over time and on the other, the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can suggest that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that Bercy has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (Why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely tired...
Early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the whole climate discussion.
But it could be an additional sand grain in the huge UNFCCC machine.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (other crucial chapter being discussed at the moment): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of recording loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Therefore, hope rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (Ex-Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one cash in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as potential or probable carcinogenic substances and five are classified as carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, we see in our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogen residues and three identified as some carcinogens as well as nearly 20 residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, as part of the study, presents traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide that is still banned in France.
The same for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in the disease of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
