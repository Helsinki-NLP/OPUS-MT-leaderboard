Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home win in opening - Savo Volley second victory
Seven times in a row, Hurricane-Loimaa played the men's football medals in the Championship League in the season 2018-19 with a home win when Raision Luima fell 3-0 on Saturday.
From Romania, Eemeli Kouki, the returned general player, was 22 points the most powerful in Hurricane.
There were a few moves abroad, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from the Lighthouse.
We got a deal pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Kokkin, Tomi Rumpunen's support played at 18 points.
The most effective among the visitors was a land team fighter who played on a match-by- match with Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points.
The victory of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with the other players, and it brought an extra bonus to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medal tube is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Highly effective Savo Fulley
Miro Mättänen was 18 points with Savo Volley's most effective when the team dropped off the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 next door.
Our game was breathtaking, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we got a squeezed victory.
At least I had no knowledge of the different kind of download when I played against my team again, Määttänen said.
In the season 2000-01, Antti Siltala, who started his career in the next 3 Series, scored 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Miro was a king, Sillikin played a good game, Juvinen said.
The last season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden Sammo while Thomas was then also the main coach.
Thiago Maciel was Duck's most powerful 14 points.
The star of Mikkonen again Aka-Volley
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen has won the league spot exchange and started this season again strongly.
The hack made 25 points when Aka-Volley took the season's opening victory after having dropped to Kokkola's Tigers 3-2.
It's been a long time since we got here.
Of course, there was a loss near today, because we had four items in the 17-21 loss.
They dug some sort of winning, and the fifth one came in at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few months ago, the Tigers had been the most effective of 28 points in the finals of the match by a fighter named Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
I didn't get much grip on this guy's hacker, Mikkone praised.
Finland compared human capital to the world one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital," says the journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top wizard was almost the same as in 1990.
Earlier, after Finland, the following were Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst places in comparison were Niger and South Sudan.
In measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has guided human capital in the context of economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held the Atletico discipline, the local game ended without goal
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois went to the great fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless match late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Antoine Greismann and Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid were closest to the goal, but the Belgian watchman Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times in a loan penalty when he was a Chelsea player.
At the start of the week, the International Football Federation, FIFA, chose him as a goalie for the year.
In real, Gareth Bale got the best goal spot, but his shot passed by at the end of the goal opening half.
After a break, Bale was replaced by a travel agent.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real’s supporters shouted in the match the name of Cristiano Ronald, who had moved to Juvento.
The United States is now being attacked against abortion... a powerful document tells us why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the top nine members could be elected by President Donald Trump as candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice might be overturned by the famous Roe, named Wade, who made an abortion in the United States legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern’s and Annie Sundberg’s documentary Reversing Roe - U.S.A. and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received different degrees of support from most of our country's people representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas is to be found, who, due to legal constraints, has remained the only doctor to perform abortions in the state of Missouri.
An armed guard in the clinic tells us he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind the clinics of the deadly terrorist attacks.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
The Lutheran Church Association was guided by women’s trust in abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but really they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of abortion herself is enough.
Deaths in the United States were about 5,000 a year.
The legalisation of abortions was primarily defended by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967 in California, the abortion law signed Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan, in turn, began to confuse religion with politicians to beat up voters.
His abortion party also turned his successor George Bush older.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
The document on the deepest core of the matter provides a basis for policy-making on abortion.
When religious organizations in favour of racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a peony horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary political ties.
This is being written in the United States in a situation in which the president of the religious right, who has been caught up in his oral harassment, has chosen Kavanaugh's highest court, which several women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israel's army fired seven Palestinians, among whom two children at the border with great demonstrations
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, when Israel has set fire to demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air in the border zone when demonstrators threw Israel’s troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun to use force so that demonstrators do not break down the border or aim for it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians died in Gazan demonstrations after March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, the wounded are 12 000.
Protesters demand access to Palestinian families in areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
The Palestinian sniper has killed one of the Israeli soldiers.
Explosions sent from the Palestinian side by lions and helium balls have set off forest areas and agricultural lands in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty shot - she couldn't shoot herself
Wigan's top star Chey Dunkley seemed to have dropped him in the penalty zone.
The divorce judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the jacket was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe her eyes.
I'm guessing the situation stayed in trouble with the referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty shot in 85 minutes when Santa was dropped.
Ward showed up with a penalty pinnacle, and Mario Vrancic hit the 1-0 profit margin.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The last one was born against QPR in a stylish way on the breast muscle last Saturday.
The job tasted again for Puk.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and untiringly defended them.
The fight for Norwich was five weeks ago.
The team will continue in the league.
There's a five-win pipeline back there.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled in - In Finland about 40,000 people experience interest in children
According to the estimate, two percent of men and a small number of women experience at least some sexual interest in their brochure age.
In Finland this means about 40,000 people.
So far, sexually interested children or young people have been hard to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients as well as helping people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy, and meeting hours were very quickly completed, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
The sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many.
Most of the pedophilic feelings in themselves have not carried out their imaginations and thus did nothing criminal.
However, this is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, Ylelle's sexual therapist, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for President Donald Trump, the idea may sound strange suddenly, but Trump is one of the top prize winners on the basis of betting efforts.
The background is that Trump has a role to play in getting North Korea, at least at speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The main favourites of the Nobel of Peace are, on the basis of the reports, the President of South Korea, Moon Jae and North Korea, Kim Jong-un, who met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the koreas is significant, as last year the intervals were very bad.
Yet, no doubt, the reward of Kim, who is leading with his nuclear weapons and his country with an iron extract, would raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and the Peace Prize will be given the most attention on Friday.
If the prize is not awarded to those who participated in the Korean peninsula, there is one of the leading candidates for the Congon physician Denis Mukwege.
The renowned gynaecologist has taken care of thousands of women victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has been working to draw attention to sexual violence, a terrible by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered as a UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told us that this year there are 331 candidates for the award.
The candidates' names will not be made public.
Trump wouldn't hurt himself if he got the Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say that myself, Trump said I was smiling.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
But there are some things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Committee in Norway, which decides on the award, has often acknowledged people and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-stakeholder world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, the reward of Trump would require an ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like respirators and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred in Luhja in the first instance occurred on 8 September.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system tool, the fire department tried to make transport normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not open, because the road has car drivers in a shock and they drive how to happen, the firefighter Pasi Kläriäinen told STT at that time recently.
At that time, even the wrong direction was taken only after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Transport Security Liaison Officer Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, the motorways and tunnels must not stop for any more than one reason.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional situations, there can be no risk of transport by means of urgent solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always be allowed to move as easily as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is, in particular, prohibited, as is the making of a U-turn and withdrawal.
The same prohibitions are also applicable in tunnels where driving lights must always be switched on.
It is also forbidden to stop without compelling reasons, as of course parking is also prohibited.
Again, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow in his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for this action, Heiskanen says in the Transport Security bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even if the ship was caught in the lakebed.
The Ilves fans, carried by the inland ship M/S in Tampere, would have liked to stay on board the ship for the victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed, says Juho Syrja, head of the ship at the time of the event.
The M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinä to Tampere, went off the route late on Saturday night and was stuck in the bottom of Vanajavede in Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the vulture.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party in the boat until the morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them on the fire station to port and by bus home, Syrja said to STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlin to follow the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the Ilves 4-3 win.
On Saturday’s day, the oatmeal was due to the surface of the water at Vanajavede about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest path sign was covered by loggerbacks, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark autumn.
No more mention of collision
A little after the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki had been crossed by the ferry route, the harei took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi River.
According to the Syrians, a greater drama was not associated, since the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground caused a more significant collision.
Depending on the distance, no leaks or pressures have occurred on the ship and the crossings of the ship are normally maintained.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship started towing off the lowland.
For the sake of certainty, we are still in the yard to check that no damage has been caused by this, Mr Syrja says.
On the other hand, it is believed that the next cruise booked next weekend in M/S Tampere can be handled appropriately.
The ship's cruise season will continue with him until his independence day.
Do not use in ambulances
The rescue department got an alarm on the case on Saturday night a little after noon.
In Viila, ambulances were alerted to accept evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
Last night, the firemaster Matti Willman told us that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the dark and rather harsh wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency announced, half the night before Sunday, that all persons on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 was established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge candidate, accused of prosecution and drinking, may be left out of top office.
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well fail to pursue his duties, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior in their studies.
Aalto reports that doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in office with someone else.
In the United States it has sometimes been the case that the President’s candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice has led to numerous conflicts.
In such cases, the candidate for judges has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to maintain his face.
The name would fall into the ranks of the Democrats
The United States Supreme Court seeks to be superior to politics, but, at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
According to Aalto, if Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain to the Democratic Party in the upcoming interim elections of the Congress.
It would increase the willingness to vote among young people and women, who would more likely vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
This is not an opportunity for every presidential term, since the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life in the United States.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70-80 years of age.
Part of Republicans also hesitates to appoint
As Aaltola points out, the candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States of America’s Supreme Court of Justice will normally be examined in the background.
Although Trump has only assigned a week to the FBI's additional investigation, Aalto says it can still bring out something essential.
I think it might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
Aalto says it is certain, at least, that Kavanaugh's suitability or inadequacies will be actively discussed before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate between 51 and 49 votes, but at least two female Republican Senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be to put the name to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
The woman identified as an agent for the Salisbury suspect's military intelligence
The Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes the poisoning of Salisbury as a military intelligence agent of the suspected Russian military.
On the basis of the photographs, she told me that it was a military intelligence at GRU Anatoli Tshepiga.
The Bellingcat Online Community and the Russian Insider Russia reported earlier that they had exposed another man suspected of poisoning to Tshepiga.
They said earlier that they have found evidence that the men’s current identities are covert personalities.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified a young Tshepigan Bellingcat's publication.
He identified the same man in the photos of the British police, in which Ruslan Boshiro was a man called himself today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Novitshok in March.
The scripts survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Russian hero's honour in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
In September, suspected men reported that they had been to Salisbury as tourists during an interview with Russian TV.
Old people with throw-off walls for war reform
A living example has now been obtained of what the Sipilä Government's definition of the restriction of change in the war reform means in practice.
My municipality of birth, Vaala sote-dienste, produces the Oulunkaare Municipal Council, whose former Regional Director, Attendo, was elected as Health Service Director in 2016.
The leaders of the municipality shall warn the council of the restriction of change.
If war expenses now rise, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were scared, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of old age care, which would end the hospital care of the health centre’s bed department and a small unit of memory patients.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn apart from the health centre by long distances in Vaalla to be treated as a home.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay customers for it.
The Left was not in bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, close friends and other parties' representatives as well.
I presented the Convention of the Sote Landschaft with the details of how the old people in the municipality of Vaala are already being treated at home most throughout the North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Western was also a member of the local council.
The local newspaper did a big thing about it, and it again raised Oulunkaare's editors on their back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Pregnants only talk about a service seal, but do not tell us what level of care it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the treatment is completed.
Without a nurse?
The health centre’s facilities are terminated because of the absence of a doctor’s night care.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of how central officials rotate the authorised ones into inadequate information and place them in the back against the wall with a restriction of change.
This means that the central aid is to be discharged from the people of Vaala, who will remain there insecure to live on a voluntary basis if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there one vote in the centre of the city that the whole country would be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdoga opened the Grand Cup in Cologne
In the city of Cologne, Germany, thousands of people showed their opinion when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoga opened the greatest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of Reinjoe from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the signs of demonstrators, and the slogans condemned Fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest in advance about the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Also, the supporters of Erdogan had gathered in the vicinity of the Great Fair.
However, the police had isolated the large area from the mosque’s environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdoga congratulated the German visit on its success and assessed the fact that it confirmed the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdoga met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel undertook to rebuild their relations, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup in 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Review Surrounded Visit
Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation at the opening as a review of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he had come to an Erdogan protest in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
To Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's German journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three charges of the journalist's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kucaki.
The prosecution reported on Friday that three people are being charged with the murder of Kucak and his bearded murder as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people during the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée from his home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and Italian mafia.
The police have suspected a murder-related investigation into the Kucak.
The case and the article published by Kucaki have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
The distribution of cattle may have problems in scattered areas on Sundays
Due to the error of printing, the Karelian will also have to be mailed as an addressless one on Sunday.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the paper in scattered areas where distribution into collective boxes is required to carry out external memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing will put extra bulbs in the region.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa's in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip, which she booked for Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed from one year to the next.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate accident, which occurred in 2014 and which caused the death penalty, things are fair.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, so his journey dates back to about the end of the year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours, and the unobstructed space is 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometers, while the Finnish astronaut tells of his coming pages.
At the same address, he also bases his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book about space travel, and I saw Star Trek on television.
Starfleet wars have been seen, and that's why the idea was put...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a tough host
Manchester City continued its lossless course in the Valioliiga, when it fell on Saturday from its home field on Brighton's painting 2-0.
The sixth guaranteed victory of the championship team is the goal-spinners Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to steer his fourth hit from the nearest distance to the empty finish when Leroy Sané found him in the back of Brighton in 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw Sterling with Brighton defense in a 65th minute playtime.
The Argentine made it easy to invest in 2-0 finals against the penalty cloud.
With six wins and a single equals, the City that started the season leads to the Valioliiga at 19 points.
However, one less-played Liverpool is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in their seventh round in a series of three Chelsea games.
Youth career selected by new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Careers selected new decision makers for their next three-year period 2019-2021.
The president was Anu Sivonen from Upper Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The council elected 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Careers will inform you on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby to be known for its quality and safety.
The Youth Career Conference in Joensuu, in its three-year objectives, gives three promises: we keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal activities regardless of location and background, as well as support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, Finland's Youth Careers will tell in their press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver"
The Swiss newspaper Blick's interview with the British driver of Mersu asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver, Sebastian Vettel, at MM points at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari said that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he will move to Sauber.
Of course Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the gloves at the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional driver. He's a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his cartoons.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed about formula number one, I played F1 game at PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The race starting at 2 p.m. begins with the Lord of Mercedes, Bottas.
The evening will be followed by a race for a moment.
The Championship Champion of the A-Young Football Series became a complete farce: the opponent arrived only with 7 players.
The top league of football boys ends on Saturday, playing the last round of the season.
Before 1 pm, the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: FC Lahti Academia is in its first place in practice a point against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn in the last round, the second Ilves in the Championship must win the PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Laity.
However, the Lahtian championship was in practice confirmed even before the initial ceremony, since Vasa IFK had only arrived in Laht with the power of seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasa, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the break, the bays led 7-0.
One reason for the players' loss is that the team has played part with the same players in the A-Young SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Second C block.
Vasa IFK has played second in practice against the fall of the entire season.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK in the guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua at Lake Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno, according to the rescue agency, there was a lot of luck.
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up at 9 a.m. on the roof in Eno.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were lightly injured, the rescue agency informed.
Good luck with that. The press release says.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet after the rain.
The police department went to the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways of investigating: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments already made, abroad planning does not slow down
According to Chief of Supo, Antti Pelttar's intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As the intelligence laws enter into force, the budget should be permanently increased to around EUR 10 million.
In Helsinki's Ratakad, the National Protection Police (Supo) are already preparing for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, a master of supo's own-spouse, tells the West Media that equipment procurement has already been carried out for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is horrified by a video in which she sings in the topless, campaigning for awareness of breast cancer.
Tenni's superstar, Serena Williams, is gonna be upsetting again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing his Instagram account a video in which he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says the news agency AFP.
The track is a 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams is supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I used The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to regularly carry out self-interaction tests on the breasts," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this placed me in an discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the color of the skin all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it plays a lot of lives.
Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53, is the second author of The Divinyls.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
The video's comments praise Williams for his courage.
Williams left the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a highlight in the open-ended U.S. tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams attacked the main judge of the match, claiming, among other things, that men are accepted much more harshly than women players.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for heights
In addition to traditional Chinese cuisine, the restaurant serves wonderful landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejang in China.
It is literally located in a rock tongue.
If you want to look at the forest that spreads below, you can look at it.
Rising landscapes in the highlands make restaurant visitors immerse themselves in the mountains of Longquan.
Access to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's toilet is.
A walk to the restaurant requires good basic condition, the place is told.
The loop run of the corpelan ends today: This is how everything ends
Everything good will end in time.
Today, this is how it goes to the native landslide of Korpela, which has been quite liked.
The third period of production has gone like hot stones: last week, 722 000 Finns were watched on television as their first show.
The top figures are no longer of any practical importance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to continue.
In the final session, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku will again be taken forward with a genuine leap, and Jaska's mother will guess the first thing to do.
Even between the merit and Misa are warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then the images appear again Laiho.
The police are also suspicious of the man in the bones.
Yet no one in your part will know the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, in turn, will have to hear incredible news.
The final will of the distance will be revealed, which will bring a woman's tears on the edge.
After a week, on Sunday night, Sorjonen will continue.
I'm playing the alley today on TV1 at 21.05.
You think it's good to go to work tomorrow in a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The cold season is getting hot.
A lot of people will decide whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected because the disease may be infectious, even if their symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the hippies.
In the latter option, you may already be infected with others, even if your symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
So you think you should stay home?
According to prevention, the flu is infectious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected for days before the symptoms start and from day five to week.
Children may be infecting the disease longer.
As soon as you recognise the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when you cough and you don't have a fever anymore, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
It's also worth avoiding your workouts.
It's too fast to get back to the gym to slow down recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, remove your handkerchiefs and throw away the scrap paper.
Painful, though?
If you have to leave your home when you are ill, consider using a protective device.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers should not be put in their noses or mouths, Poland says.
The sanctions are also limited by the machine.
Then how can you avoid being infected?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the U.S., average blood pressure touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missile: "The man is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the misses are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23, which was the case with Alina Voronkova.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been given the crown of Finland in 2018.
She lives in Lahti today, where she moved 15 years old.
Alina's mother is an inker Finnish and father is a Russian.
The father's Russians were bullied at Voronkova at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted for my Russianism.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina tells us at the semifinalist release of the Miss Suomi contest.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to high school.
Soon, the missikanotar found new friends and the ark went rolling hopefully.
Then, when I was 15, I thought I was an adult, but I really wasn't thinking about that afterwards.
Three years ago Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurr , who is familiar with the Pelicans Rivers.
After a career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, a couple lived almost a year in a distance relationship, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winner's three and with it I'd have a career, then I don't want to believe that it would in any way affect our relationship.
Even if we had to live apart, we have good faith and the good side of the distance is that the initial stone remains on top of the full time, Alina felt in May.
Happy to continue growing, death on our laps
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Still, there's nothing you want to give up.
Continued growth is being sought for sustainable alternatives, but even the theory of a moderate economy is collapsing with major problems.
Over the course of a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that used to be only dreamy.
However, the prolonged overrun of the Earth’s viability and climate change make this market economy’s rock foot a threat.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmä, Sitrator, at 4:00 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbed and another, born in 1968, less.
Older men have already left the hospital.
The police have caught one person whose potential contribution to the beating will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect related to events.
Events are being investigated as a murder enterprise and as a gross assault.
IFK Mariehamn Important Point - The Interin Coach was wrong
IFK Mariehamn Simon Silverholt’s balancing goal against Inter brought an important point to the team on Saturday for the men’s football league.
Silverholt finished the match by 78. minutes.

An important goal and a valuable point, the head coach of Mariehamn Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not start a battle that he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily the fury paint brought us stronger according to the game.
According to chief coach John Allen, home team Inter, the game was under control, but the finish again caused pain.
One defense error took us from a full pointer, Allen's trouble.
Again, we were the best!

The magazine showed its underpower, the venue is not yet certain
Jori Lehter’s strong underpower playing arose as his NHL partner Philadelphia Flyers played his last training game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehter entered Michael Raffle twice in the finish line.
In the last few days, the magazine has been on the rise because of drug suspicions.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehter is one of 23 suspected drug associations, some suspected of drug use and some suspected of selling, for example.
The magazine has denied it was guilty of a crime.
The team and the player have been discussing the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, the journalist Sam Carchidi, who was closely following the Philadelphia Inquirer, estimated that Lehter was part of the six-attack group, five of which were given a seat on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, in the training game, the magazine was excellent.
In the second installment, Lehter fought under the helm of the helm, pulled the defenseman against him, and entered the opening place of Raffle, who had been waiting for the finish.
The second time a double cooperation brought the goal at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, the defenseman Urho Vakaninen expects the team's training management solution if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, the horizontal said in an interview on Boston's Twitter account.
In river boys, the Vakanian played for Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
In Boston, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.

Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goaltender Mikko Koski.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played for over 20 minutes and put a goal against Tampa Bay in the local game.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus's defenseman Markus Nutivaara entered his team's comfort goal in the middle of the deal when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.

The recent picture shows a change: The strongest man in the world has lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, the most powerful man in the world, went through an eye-catching transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall was able to eat up to 10,000 pounds a day for food and, according to the Mirror magazine, he weighed 200 pounds the largest.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
Britti hunted for the world's strongest men's competition by all means, and a family man promised to quit his career if he got a title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen in April, the strongest men in the world in 2018.
In fact, Hall published a picture on Instagram, where he significantly poses his active career in a cleaner condition.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he was training five weeks a week in aerobics today.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall will do four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world, the Icelandic Redman, known from the Game of Thrones TV series Haf the Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crawled to the farm in Pyhäjärvi - "Sustainably closed with rock"
The inland ship M/S Tampere drove to the farm late Friday night in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue agency received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday night after half past noon.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has turned into a caroline, and is firmly attached to its bow with a stone, described the fireman Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers on board and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue agency, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're being transferred by bus to Tampere, told emergency friend chief Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m.
Ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers at the port of Viila.
For some reason, a ship that had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had departed west of the narrow Jumusensalmi route.
The police will find out why.
The dayfriend firemaster Matti Willman told us earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the dark and rather harsh wind.
According to the rescue facility, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will start checking the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, the M/S Tampere is currently a restaurant-based inland waterway vessel with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
The vessel also has a meeting room for private use to rent.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was discovered in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers charge Robert Helenis for unpaid fees
Boxer Robert Helenius's night fight against Erka Teper is a shadow of a conflict of money.
Evening-Sanomat announced today that Boxing Manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkinla have submitted an application for a total of EUR 80 000 in outstanding management fees from Helen.
According to the request, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done," says Kokkala to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent it to Iltalehti in return for the boxer's view.
Helen denies that he is obliged to pay the required sum.
In return, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a difficult economic situation to Helen and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorship revenues for him.
To put it another way: Helenius was obliged to pay fees only percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, just receive the income they arranged.
This is also a normal and unique practice in professional athletes' management.
The wage work has never been agreed, and it would also have been absurd in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In return, since the beginning, Helenius would have liked to agree on income distribution in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He, on his own behalf, made the proposal a bad one and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helen did not fight once when dealing with Kokkala and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Heleni had been shown an "individual but large" decline in the manager's work.
The same arguments have been raised this year.
Heleni regards the subsequent activity of Helminen and Kokkala as a poor face, in return stated.
Today, Helen meets Erkan Teper in Stuttgart, Germany, on the seventh edition of the IBF’s heavy competition.
A hearty man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt the late radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
A long-range radio driver and journalist Erkki Pälli died of liver cancer that was unhealed at the age of 83.
The driver's death notice was published on Sunday in Helsinki Sanomam.
The report tells of the death of Päll on 3 September.
Päälli reported on a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by knowledge of familiar destiny.
He left on Facebook earlier than good-bye, says Ile Vainio.
The auction takes Erkki Päll as a multi-talented participant, who became a great editor.
He recalls Päll's being a man with fast hooks and fun things.
I already got to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finn's album at the age of 12 and started there as a storekeeper.
We met Erk at the time.
He was then the editor of the Finn disc and various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I began to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of opportunities where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor for all the artists at the party.
He was always expert and saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, for music, and for people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to his interview with the skin.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a highly respected radio drinker, but he also wrote great news stories.
He interviewed me many times, too.
He was good at talking, Son of a bitch.
For decades, Pälli worked in addition to the journalist's work with Fazer, a label company called wishe Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Lori's records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became acquainted with numerous listeners in the high ether.
He retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Ski Federation announced that the financial period ended in May showed some EUR 450 000 in profits.
The association describes the "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, burdened with "a significant debt in the balance".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala congratulates the rapid response and strict fiscal discipline.
Last autumn, we responded as quickly as possible to the situation by taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning and financial management of the operation has been impacted through the whole of our organisation, Kulmala says in the press release.
We have also succeeded well in the partner acquisition and, in addition, the return on the World Cup was the maximum in the past competitive period.
However, in the future the management of costs must also be accurate, while at the same time we must continue to look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Ten bodies lie in the back yard of the hospital in the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates those from the area where injured survivors have been collected for the purpose of assessing the need for disability and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to post-mortem conditions.
One of the people in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returnee from Baharudd who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I talked to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
In the yard of the army hospital in Palua, Dwi Haris lay down, who has had injuries to his back and arm.
He was at the beginning of the storm at the local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited back to the wedding party.
I probably had to go under the wall that had collapsed in the cracks.
I heard my wife shouting for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe," Haris told the AP, according to the British media.
♪ Small shops are being robbed ♪
Back in the evacuation center, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her fevery baby.
He described the atmospheres in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere," said Kusuma.
Many of the inhabitants of Palau have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Although the household would somehow be able to do so, possible post-fouling could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants alone.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison fled after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there might be about 300 fugitives.
The prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners raged and set the prison fire after the guards had refused to leave to search for their relatives suffering from earthquakes and tsunamis.
The return airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first to land in the field was an army C-130 transporter that brought aid supplies.
Commercial flights to the Return field are only permitted to a limited extent.
The pilots will have to land in the field without the help of the air traffic controller, as the air traffic control tower was damaged by a bad earthquake.
Rain wipes over Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, the entire earth spreads from the western direction to the west, says the Institute of Revelation.
The rain comes mostly as water, but in Central and Northern Lapland there is expected to be sluggish or snow.
The packs of the previous night are not repeating because the temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
A brighter night keeps the lowest temperatures under effective control.
Just in the west, you can get a quick side, said the emergency meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will turn eastwards in the morning.
In the south and west, there are pouts or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures will travel up to the altitude of Oulu at 10-13 degrees Celsius.
The beginning of the week looks similar for the temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are valid in marine areas.
True autumn storms are not expected in the near future, but otherwise there will be a typical variable autumn weather.
It's just that the fall's starting to blow on, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final not seen on TV
From IL-TV, you can watch the red rug of glamour and the spray of the Miss Suomi competition.
On IL-TV, the entertainment editors draw a live broadcast of the Miss Suomi final from the red carpet of Billnäs.
The shipment will start at approximately 6.50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in Billnäs's pot in Raasepor.
Before you start the final, you will be able to watch the atmosphere from the top of the spot on the IL-TV live broadcast.
The live broadcast begins at around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
In the jury, they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other representatives of the judiciary are the well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Managing Director of Jouni Kaupa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer of Siiska Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the Missiles.
Russian Dimitri's and Inger-like Svetlana's mother believed her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
Recent Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova's parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova were proud to follow her daughter's first few moments at the end of the crown.
They said they were going to rain to the audience in Pertunmaa, and they were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an ingar and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks of a smooth Russian, even though she has lived in Finland for her whole childhood.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was less interested in acting and many other things than the career of a miss.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty that I should get sick.
But he said he wanted to be a radio driver.
Only later was Alina excited about the beauty contests.
Parents hoped that Alina would get to university before taking part in the Miss Finland contest.
This was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to do a lawsuit before the missics.
We asked last year why he was not taking part, but he wanted to finish that candidature.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults too.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be there, I see it.
Alina's boyfriend Jonas Hurri is hockey in Japan, and he didn't get into Finland to encourage me to love the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a miss year.
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be!
The parents were hoping she'd be here soon.
Now it's been so long for a visit because of the missiles.
It's already a shame, even if we've put out messages.
A young man died on the run in Lahti - police caught three people
According to the police, three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
The Hämeen police did not comment on the course of events on Saturday, nor on the possibility of overruns by the intent of the investigation.
Nor did the police comment on whether the arrested persons and the man who died over the course of his life felt like he was a former man.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a mother-in-law in Finland - thought came up with the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At the time, my husband's speech, in which he suggested it as a person in the story that I developed, went on to tell the Spanish cartoon blogger, mother-in-law and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo tells us that he was in Brussels as an EU translator for economic and legal matters until after the fourth child became a returnee ten years ago.
I'm very happy as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what the big one would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then 2014 became a comic.
Piippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix from a small point of view.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of the Creator Spirit began to be produced, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I did not get her attracted until the summer of 2016 when I donated the Vivien with a drawing disc.
His passion lasted tens of times a strip, and then it was necessary to start trying to laugh at Piippo, who tells us that the drawing was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
For the paper I didn't even try to draw, says Piippo about his relationship with the drawing he usually does at night.
The manuscripts pop up all the time, but usually I don't do it at a time.
It takes up to several hours to make a stripper on one of the three screens.
I might do a screen at once and I'd love to play with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the most difficult because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells us that he appreciates Scott Adams Dilbert's current comics.
As people with a creative touch, the L-theme has been roamed by a carrot-like mother with a salad hair soap.
Other people are the Man, the Pissis and the Twins.
In the creative world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a compulsive bottle, even if something is in place between the physiotherapists.
Piippo tells us he's reading his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you're drawing and you realize that this is what I've done today.
And enough challenges for the mother!

Indonesian earthquake: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung stayed alone in the air traffic control tower until he safely transported hundreds of people to travel safely from an island filled with earthquakes.
The young man was in turn at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave the location before being able to take the Batik Air passenger plane off the runway.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Air Force told the AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was shattering and cracking.
Eventually Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he had serious internal injuries.
Agung was welcomed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transporting the helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a member of the Air Force told The Jakarta Post.
The collision continued to increase as the flight entered the air, and a force of 7.5 magnitodes was finally measured.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism in the social media.
He considered Europe's conclusion to the trade war in Uple: "You have to look at the next twit"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director-General Olli Rehn said, in Yle's first impression, that, even if tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the decisions taken by companies to invest.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, the Rehn believes that Europe is a very good place to work.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States and has helped to calm the situation with China and Japan as well.
Europe does not seem to be bursting into the feet of the trade war.
I have to look at the next twist and then assess it.
We have quite an unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, but he said he was in the interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
On Thursday evening, the markets reacted sharply to the deficit budget presented by the Italian Government.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of the population.
He thinks that the situation in Italy is a matter of concern.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and unsystemed loans are more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are at a disadvantage, and the country seems to again exceed its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe into the new economic crisis.
The second thing that is trying to do for Europe is the UK's difference from the EU.
Ehn was hoping he'd make it up to me.
There would be much more negative effects on the conflicting distinction.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his duties after a year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name has been mentioned.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he wasn't going to comment on it any further.
HS's super-populated Black Box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsingin Sanoma will continue again in the beginning of the week.
The other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
23 October Black box is the first time to visit the Tampere theatre.
There are still tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere presentation has been sold out.
Tickets sell Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will report on their long-preparated true story, which has not been previously published in any of the HS instruments.
There's something again that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from across the globe and a talk about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilija, one of Black Box producers.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and to continue the discussion.
The Helsinki Languages have organised the nights of living journalism for three years.
From the beginning, they have been popular and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the house.
The Black Box was awarded in the Bonnier Gaaal as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners thanked the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show is also held in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the performance has a different content from this autumn’s evening.
The missing mushroom maker was found to be the "premature experiment"
The drone skills of the Finnish police are at the top of the world: "We are asking for training"
According to the head of the University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drones in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in a crime scene investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the missing funnel drone in Raahe in just a few minutes.
The Vice-Chancellor Kimmo Himberg referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "by means of unprecedented experiment and effective education we are also the top of the world".
Drone's a pretty new hijacker, and that's the newer police job.
There are no statistics on whether the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
It's very interesting about it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to look at the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's becoming more widespread
Himberg points out that in winter conditions in Finland it is very important to find someone who has disappeared as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost ones were found using the drone only within a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Even now, drones are being used in police tasks, and their use will become more widespread and more widespread in the future.
That's how I'd dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to the search for missing persons, according to Himberg, the police can use drones, for example in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, we need to go a little further to check out an area where there is perhaps fear that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for pre-information.
Karelian Rugby ascended to the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrates the victory in Kuopio on Saturday for a 2-division victory.
The Joensuus were still in the middle of the match at the 7-12 defeat to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and took off to the south’s visitors 26-12.
At the same time, the two-division championship knew of a historic rise for Karelian Rugby in its 1-division.
The club has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-section 1 division.
The company is going to take over the series, but it knows about the work for next winter.
The current grid of just under twenty players must be reached by 25.
The 1-division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the acquisition of funds must also be in line with it.
Kotkanim starts the season in Montreal, confirms the main coach
In the hockey NHL, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien confirmed on Twitter that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkanemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super-lovaus Kotkaniemen, 18th round, with the first three summer bookings.
The attacker joined the Montreal training strength from the end of the season and has presented strong extracts in the September training games.
In his first training game, the Kotkanemimi managed to score a goal.
Chief coach Julie said she had taken a big step forward after entering the camp.
The NHL's body set will begin next week on the night against Thursday in Finland's time.
Montreal meets in the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
Much has been said about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, the president of the Nokian government, Risto Siilasmaa, told of his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of management.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila denied the accusations sharply, but earlier Nokia statements have mentioned the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, in part, caused the mobile phone business to collapse.
The risk-taking capacity and the flexibilities of the increase in the company disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the cream of the Finnish Business Centre, was also held in Helsinki.
In addition to Barack Obama, the stage was marked by 12 stars of business.
That's enough talk about good management.
Gary Hamel, the legend of the professors of management, said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally bound to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods trade chain known for its wide range of creations, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot be merely to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book’s introverts, said that the most successful leaders are researched to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the characteristics of a good leader must be met in one way or another with the life cycle of the company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lectures at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of an information flash.
A good leader requires a lot.
That is why management goes wrong so often, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the scenes together.
However, they did not consider whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for the outsiders to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived on a gorgeous red carpet right from Los Angeles... spending most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived on a mission in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finnish dress also featured a pistachios.
A little bit of a pod's jet.
I came back from Los Angeles.
For a long time, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me his stories.
Chafak tells me that he's going to L.A. to test.
He's been doing commercials, among other things.
Working in the United States, he describes himself as interesting, as he is in Finland.
Though, according to him, work must be done even harder, for the model’s work is always easily replaced.
I have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreograph for Sonya Lindfors 30 000 euro live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30 000 cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
The winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors, works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to his immediate environment.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been absent, the winner was described as a winner.
In addition to Lindfors, there were a number of international artists as candidates for the award.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group of live art in the field.
Danish police found a great Volvo on the mission: "We can't tell you where"
The extensive searches by the Danish police have produced a result.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed at the bridges of Juutinrauma and Iso-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Iceland was closed to Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police searched for black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Department.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't yet tell you where the car was found.
According to Storm, the sought-after black Volvo is not in direct contact with the police.
She says the greatest danger is over.
Danish Ekstra Bladet told us about a police briefing on Saturday.
The investigator, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was at the expense of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of crime they're investigating.
But Skov told me that it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the paper, ferry traffic restrictions have been withdrawn.
Copenhagen police also followed events on their Twitter accounts.
The STT states, however, that according to the police, the general public no longer has a cause for concern, as the threat was to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of discord - now the people are voting on it in a contentious election
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name.
Under the Macedonian and Greek Governments agreement, the Republic of Northern Macedonia would be named.
Greece has so far prevented its veto efforts to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum is not a new name, but rather a question of whether the voter is in favour of membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by adopting the agreement.
The vote began on a veritable basis at a school in the centre of Skopje, at least in the capital city.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted in the school, wished to support the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change for young people in particular, he said.
In 1991, the name of the independent Macedonian Republic of former Yugoslavia was used in official contacts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The national-minded right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the voter turnout exceeds the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A majority of two thirds of Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also still has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations will close in Finland at nine o’clock.
That's a great win!
Robert Helenius knocked off Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night in Germany for a heavy season of professional racing by Erka Teper.
The 34-year-old Finnish took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, Stuttgart.
The final match of the night was the heavy Intercontinental title match of the IBF.
Its winner can be given the opportunity to take part on Saturday in tougher tasks of considerable economic importance.
Helen solved the match in the eighth round, when he struck Teper with a strong left hand.
Teper couldn't get up from the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" already hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helen and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
Then it became apparent that the German was twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken his name from his professional career in 28 games and suffered two losses.
Teper, who was a clear favourite, won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career.
Hamilton's deposit order to win - difference I've already drawn 50 points
The Formula One Championship approached its confirmation again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Gp and ran his MM-lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel at 50 points (306-256).
There's five more races left.
Master Bottas, who had left the Pope's age, was driving second.
Last year in Sotsh, Bottas, who had won his career, held a lead spot in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to pass Hamilton.
Wettel drove to third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen to fourth.
The Red Bull Max Verstappen, who started the last line, was fifth.
The two of them assaulted a Jew in Joensuu, caught a block away.
Two men were assaulted by beating and kicking a 31-year-old Jew in Joensuu at Sillakatu 12 on Saturday after 6:00 p.m.
According to the police, the men also rang the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached the suspects, the 35-year-old, and the 39-year-old, happy man, shortly after the event.
They were caught in a suspect's robbery, the police tell us.
The victim suffered from a stroke that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will leave his office as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his references that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
US Securities Commission SEC has accused Muski of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach agreement with the United States on Napht
It is time to put an end to the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada.
The United States has set the ceiling on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have discussed the weekend closely.
Canada's Chief Adviser, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
On the demand of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement for Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador take office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the United States Congress to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were being set on fire in Kaakkur. The fire department was being alarmed.
Candles burned in a apartment in Oulu Kaakkur on Sunday caused fire alarms.
Ten units of the rescue agency were called up because of a possible floor-to-floor fire.
On the spot, it was found that candles burned on the sauna of the apartment house had appeared to the opposite house as a fire, which had therefore been reported to the emergency center.
There was no fire on the target.
Police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - rapping on the field and at the metro station
The police caught eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of men played in Espoo, the Western U.S. Police Crime Commissioner Temu Värtinen confirmed the STT.
The reason for this was crime and protection against interference.
The prisoners were released after the situation was calmed down, Värtinen said.
It's interesting to hear earlier about the Night Words.
The fight ended with 0-0.
After the end of the campaign, a large number of viewers ran out of the HJK’s dedicated audience.
The situation led to push-ups and fist fights between the team supporters.
Horsemen, among other things, were needed to put an end to this situation.
In addition to the field, the rapprochement took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the raging that took place in the field.
There have been no criminal reports as a result of the events.
The table stone jammed its butterfly swim at the SE World Cup, Laukkanen also swims in the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have moved to the finals on the final day of the World Cup 3/7 races in the Netherlands.
You're going to be swimming in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Table Stone hastened Finland's record at 50 metres of butterfly forest, where he was the second of the originals in the 22.82 period.
Previously, in September, Table Stone swimd in Helsinki on the voyage to SE-time 22,77.
Ari-Pekka Lukkkonen, representing Cestus, was a butterfly of 24 in the period 24,68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was at the beginning of 50 meters of the chest at the sixth time in 30.48 and moved on to the final.
At the beginning of two hundred meters of confusion, Laukkanen was 15 in time 2.14.25.
Students play a rare taste: the ancient tragedy - the relieved Orestheia acts with its visuality
Ancient tragedies are rare in Finnish theatres.
For example, the National Theatre last saw the ancient tragedy of Sofokleen Filoktetes in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought the only complete drama trilogy, Aishylus Oresteia, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat open! projects that started in 2015, acting students from the Theatre University work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, as well as the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, a Berlin resident.
His international first night in Oreste was in Berlin in April.
The agreement on Orestei is to summarise the report on the end of the bloodshed of the condemned Atreus family and the successful birth of the rule of law to twenty minutes, in particular by consolidating the choir parts.
The work succeeds in being a very faithful spirit of the fine Finnish of Kirsti Simongrand (2003).
Dramatic lights and the revealing theatre space pages highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
In turn, it focuses on the dynamics between the dissipating actors who act as namesakes and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returned from the Troy War, and this catch of war, Kassandra, are shown on the stage, as was the custom of the ancient tradition of performance.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the antiquity strategy.
Rather, in front of the viewer's eyes, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to identify the master phase as a close group of actress students, directly one organism, a group of rhythmics.
Especially in the choir parts very expressive, sculpture-like group formations, the actors who are inclined to enter their rights in the open, only with the decoration of the white curtain, on the stage.
Impressive.
The Orestean performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen carrier
The new will begin to be seen in Europe, in particular through the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA Car Show, Hyundai will supply a new version of the thousands of cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By entering the market, Hyundai will continue with Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles.
In this quality of the world's first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, Hyundai Motor's Vice President, In Cheol Lee, said the agreement at the publication conference.
The fists rubbed several times in Kajaan
A little over thirty men assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and represented it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in the removal of him from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, he was still beaten by an evildoer.
The police caught the assaulter.
The police force continued to act aggressively and kicked another police officer into the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the prison to calm down.
The case is investigated as three assaults and as a violent opposition by the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, there was also another case of assault on Saturday morning.
The victim assaulted two men.
First, about 20-year-old Kajanian man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and a man who had previously beaten him was still kicking the victim.
The outsiders pulled the criminals further away from the victim and there was a police call.
However, the perpetrators had to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask the incident observers to contact Kajaan Police at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at poll.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
A long line radio driver Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Päälli, who was known as a long-term supplier, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio drinker Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
It's time to go.
Even the doctor has said it, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the 11th century a month ago.
The security of trade and of sets must be ensured
For the first time in 1984, I received a newspaper contract.
When these rings of years make a point of surprise, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of the retail trade workers, I was amazed and at a moment even slightly angry.
I also spoke about the case of the trade union for services (PAM) working environment expert Erika Kähä.
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers say otherwise.
There are only cases clearly proven to be serious by the police, and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, businesses have a responsibility to analyse their situation in the near future on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect any of their data," he said.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In situations of violence, there has always been a problem that there are not always physical injuries.
Mental trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the difference between a situation of violence and a situation of threat when even a certain level of aggressive threats have to be calculated as violence, even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though no actual action is taking place.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store's got guards.
The release of market opening hours was also a high time in the media for its impact on the safety of sellers.
"Then many employers arranged security services at least for night hours and alone to prevent work," Kähär commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
As a result of the guarding, the situation was well maintained, a perception emerged that the guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to find solutions to eliminate expensive security services.
A minor assault is a crime of a lawyer, and it is quite understandable that a salesman who has been abused does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
However, according to the same section of the 2011 Act, a minor assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think there's a need for precedents now.
The next time a commercial aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When the court put a few criminals in prison, and sentenced them to a severe degree of punishment, they would get cleaned up.
The society in which the grocery store must be in the small town, open almost night and day, must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed with the Miss before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's coronation this year does not see the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast shows the Viafree website.
Former Miss Finland host Heidi Sohlberg and host the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet work as Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the three of the publishers told the incoming visitors and media representatives about the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula the violent applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now look at this our man drinker, Sohlberg glowed at his fellow audience in cheer.
Frontline races are followed by many years earlier, Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg was looking at Saro.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the just separated Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though at first seemed confused.
Sieppi spoke of his resignation for the first time in the weekend of the Night-Sanomia.
Missikaunotar told us that he does not want to open up the reasons for this distinction more precisely in public, because it is between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he was not rushing into a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marital status became apparent at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The drinker three laughed at the crap.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi made a mistake.
The northerly man tortured the tied to his open mate by cutting, burning, and feeding strong sauce.
The District Court of the North has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison.
Among other things, the crime instrument was a belt, a cable and a handkerchief.
The court condemned these items as lost to the state.
Rak's case involved a suspect of gross rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the district court.
The Kokkolan cause included four assaults, gross assaults, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty, and two injuries.
Crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the last acts, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last week, on Thursday, the district court of the North Sea passed its sentence and ordered 34-year-olds to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
34-year-olds were also accused of two gross crimes of liberty and of the serious rape that took place on May 22nd.
However, these accusations were rejected as unimaginable.
The case was handled behind closed doors in court.
However, the district court issued a public statement of the judgment.
According to the District Court, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and repression in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with tobacco, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to have lost its criminal assets: a belt and cable, a tie, a bath belt, a knife and a vessur.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between actions.
It can be read from the judgment that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
For the victim, 34-year-old should pay compensation for pain, breakage, suffering and temporary harm a total of 5,800 euros.
I don't think he's got the money he's got, 'cause he already has an old debt in his inheritance.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The afternoon will not give you a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case in the recent district court where it is written by law.
Europe at the top of the four-point Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their lead in a traditional gambling game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup to 10-6 in Paris, while on Sundays, twelve games will be played.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon the winnings were equal to 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had been able to reach the same level.
On Sunday, the twins will be looking for more history.
No European player has won five points together at the Ryder Cup, and no American players have been able to win as three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJK condemns its supporters for the brutal harassment of the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football league team HJK published on Sunday in Tapiola, where it condemns its supporters for their behaviour in the Saturday FC Honka match.
"We regret events after the Honka-HJK match for our supporters," the press release says.
At the end of the game, some 50 HJK supporters ran into the field and some seemed to try to challenge a dispute with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
It was not the situation that caused the organizers to calm down, but the police and also the horsemen were needed.
When HJK announces that the team’s players and staff are shocked by the events.
Post-test events are not consistent with the values of our traditional 111-year-old company.
"We strongly withdraw from any action which endangers the security of fighting events", states the press.
HJK's permission to assist authorities and event organizers in identifying factors that threaten safety and eliminating mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support in every way positive, happy and encouraging action in football viewers.
"We don't have any strength," says the press release.
The Filipino inventor flies by drone car - this is how to avoid traffic congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He's now part of a growing group in the world who swears to have invented a flying car... or at least his own version of it.
In competition, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production of his equipment.
According to reports from all over the world, a great deal of his property has been used to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight, and he flagged his aircraft at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will give rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL foretells: Working activities starting tomorrow will be visible in day care and social and health services for children
In the public and welfare sectors, the prohibitions of over-work and exchange will begin tomorrow, especially in the social and health services and in the day care of children, JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine estimates.
The effects will be wide-ranging and will certainly be seen in such a way that there is not enough staff.
Everyone has to think about how they're gonna get their kids.
The employer's task now is to make sure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Lainee, in the early part of the year, employees were also at a low level when members of the JHL were in over-work and in exchange for the reasons of contractual negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for employees not to have been hired, but to have been overworked or changed.
This is not yet a job-fighting operation.
It is absolutely normal, in terms of health and safety, that regular working hours should be taken care of for every worker and that they should only be taken care of.
JHL opposes the action of the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies against dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, director of the labour market of municipal employers, does not pre-assess the effects of the over-work and over-turn bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may weaken.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have prepared what is to be done.
The area is so far from being so extensive, social, health and technical, that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary greatly between sectors, regions and employers," said Jalonen to the STT.
Mr Jalonen says that, last week, experience was already gained, among other things, from the activities of the Super and Basic Care Association and the trade union for the social and health sector Tehyn, which lasted for three days.
Their effects were rather small.
The JHL ban on over-work and exchange concerns, among other things, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the work struggle concerns almost 100 000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Lainee, JHL's actions may last for a long time.
The Federation has also prepared for other work-related activities if the drafting of the notice of termination continues.
The government should now admit that we are running into a wall and hard.
Jalos believes that both the Ay movement and the government must be opposed.
This is something special that the hard ones are already in the pipeline, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen is updating.
The great Coral Cross is born with the power of children and adults in the gyms, studying raucous and seahorse animals.
Last spring, the Great Coral Rift of the second collective in Hamburg received its first performance in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like previous works by the group, the Great Coral Rivet is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
However, this time we will also build a clearer, more limited presentation, which will refresh and crystallise the initial observations.
There are plenty of hundreds of magical magic in the theatre game for children's parties.
The child's perspective has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
Nevertheless, the great Coral Cross is not a presentation of children, but a presentation by adults and children in co-operation.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practice and common lessons also dissolves distance between adults and children.
As a result, the great coral reef resembles some of the sabbalet, fitness circuit, and natural awareness attacks, but finally it is located in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The large coral reef begins with a visit to the commercial lanes of corals and of organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
In the six different fitness settings, e.g. escalators are taught about the animals of the escarpment and the sea horse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and shiny paintings and costumes will help you to discover the coral reef in life.
There are both divers in the large coral reef that observe the coral reef’s life and corals that are being viewed.
There are also coral-looking organisms.
The visions and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life escalating.
Be a landscape of some organism, an organism that looks at the landscape, and another organism or landscape - and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for children.
In other locations, the group seeks to exercise its thinking and activity at the border to which, when it consists of both children and adults, it is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration is held on behalf of threatened corals at Sitrator.
Man’s transcendence of destruction should not be allowed to take hold, even though it might be difficult to understand the importance of exercising his own compassion in the face of the visions of destruction.
Others have built their work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life by political gesture.
There are also other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and play it clear space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood had no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people are starting smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others also say they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his sister in the fifth grade from a "boyfriend" weekend.
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I could not imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned all our childhood that drugs must not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and that they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I am constantly seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup in their pictures and wearing clothes.
Snapchat is used for taking and sending images that reveal the evenings.
It's harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood didn't have smartphones.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think about me.
General: Authorities told the head of state that the case of Airiston Helmi was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed above, the security police and the defence forces went to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that Airisto Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but rather to organised crime, says Yle.
The unnamed sources' information confirmed Ylelle's Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the protection police this week visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees for the ongoing investigation.
This is seen primarily as an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in the interview of the Superior.
According to the above information, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found to date in the material seized, but the investigation is just on its way.
We can't yet know what can be revealed there, one of the interviewees of Yle says.
A week ago, extensive search for homes in the Turku archipelago and the mainland raised the question of whether the investigation is about mere economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
It was earlier this week that the case was discussed both on behalf of and against the allegations.
Video: The dream story saved Liverpool’s series
Liverpool's 100% start on the Valioliiga was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 game on Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be just a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and fled to the 1-0 guest win.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent the entire Valoliiga signal that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klok came to Western London at the same time.
The Reds had begun with the Valoliiga with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule on his own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league win from Anfield Road during Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard has been involved from the very beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first balled in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorge.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard leap forward and sent this perfectly weighted breakthrough.
Hazard ran into the edge of the penalty area, but bombed a perfect left leg bet at the back.
Pool's brass guard, Alison, was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position slightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned up Mo Salah's guidance from the finish line.
In the second period, Chelsea-vesskari Kepa also made a real move.
The Basque guard quickly responded to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the pole from the pole to the corner.
At the other end of his life, Alison threw a zero at the Hazard transit.
The best place for visitors came in 72nd minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino at his center.
However, the bag of the Brass Star was headed toward the country teammate David Luis, who saved the master’s lead.
Nor did it last for 89th minutes, when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to fire at 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombarded it to the top of an unopposed bet.
Liverpool's 100% league launch ended with a 1-1 game, but it's still in the league, along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship skills two points behind the top.
The poteros are deep in the movement debate
I remember when some decade ago a newspaper asked various Finnish influences, which divides the people of Finland.
Juice Leskise's answer was the only one left in mind: the nose-end.
Some have a nose-end in their last name and some have a no.
Well, there's a lot to be born anywhere, and here's one offerer.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abandonment of the annual clock shift.
A lot of people agree that two-time clock shift times a year has been a fool’s job and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems at least the easiest step in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to solve what time is finally to end: the current summer or winter time or another time zone.
This also makes it possible for the people to say their opinion on the hostage page.fi.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is intense on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
In winter time, defending their fundamental position with the influence of morning light on the well-being of people and on the summer time, the influence of the evening will on the outdoors and thus on the well-being of people.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies also show that morning light is raging on a man’s day and giving expression.
On the other hand, if not particularly affected by the wake-up in the dark, there will be more light on the movement of people outside and better opportunities for, for example, autumn courtyards.
The additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for the hour.
I'd like to take both of them, but bad, though, in our place on the north side of the earth, there's nothing we can do.
Winters are too dark and summers for many too bright anyway.
The typical debate on the subject is that one’s own view is pursued and one’s view is strongly opposed.
The opponent's arguments are not exactly heard, because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost all people have an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat useless to try to turn one’s head.
There's a lot of dirt in it.
The subject is extremely easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and there is enough mutual experience to justify it.
The same type of issues are usually discussed more sharply and equally infertilely.
It's a shame if the wrong choice is made, but I don't think it's gonna work out.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels as if it's a waste of time.
Josba fought for the guest victory of the clairvoyant
Josba's first guest game in Salibandy's Divar produced a full three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left the Seinäjoki river to travel home with joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
The grass still led the goal at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and circulated men in the chains.
In the time of 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi had a six-five-year-old.
Both teams were left behind for decisive minutes.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was of fire, anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (+0) also played his goal at the time of birth in the second chain.
Josballa is six points after three series rounds.
The next one is O2-Jyväskylä, who will be visiting in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary party
The 200th anniversary of the Eno church will be celebrated in some of the sad atmospheres tomorrow Sunday.
The destruction of the church's ravages a week ago was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party tonight.
Although no one would like that, Eno’s church is now the oldest church of the Joensuu congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite the municipal and other associations of the world.
Family meeting starts at Eno church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the congregation house at the cattle's table.
The program has all kinds of things inside and outside for a long day.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who retired for 37 years.
The Church’s birthday celebration also means the end of one era.
The church house, built in 1982, has already been closed for the last time today.
Now we're in the dormitory in the former town hall, the chaplain Markku Koistinen says.
The church house destroyed indoor air problems, but the church has been in a healthy place for the last 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the head of the Tesla government's speech, and the fraud charges were settled with $40 million.
Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed on a legal case with the US Securities Markets Authority (SEC).
SEC suspected that Musk had committed a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being abandoned by the company he set up.
Musk may, however, continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to resign from the place of the Chairman of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire the Chairman of the External Government.
Musk is also subject to stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent directors and continue to monitor Muskin's communication.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and the disadvantages of Tesla's shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secured.
Tviet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
SEC suspected that Muski had committed a security fraud.
According to the Agency, TV was false and misleading and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other management or potential financiers of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it will challenge the company and Muski's case.
The SEC said it demanded that Musk be sentenced to fines and banned from acting under the leadership of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went down sharply.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, says the country’s disaster agency, according to the AFP.
The number of deaths is expected to increase further, as destruction is in the process of being resolved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami, which attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was issued immediately after the outbreak of the tsunami, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are, at least for the time being, from Reign.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to be dead.
Rough requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been called upon to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without being exhausted day and night.
One of the rescues is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to be 50-60 people in the ruins.
The chief of the rescue agency Muhammad Syaug told us that one person in the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular for business travellers, was made alive.
We also heard people asking for help, he told us.
According to Syaugi, heavy clearance equipment would be quickly needed in the area of the quake and tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you in and around.
My friend's family is still missing, and one of the writers was on Facebook.
Phone numbers of politicians leaked into the hands of harassment in Britain
Many British politicians were disturbed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
Interferences came into the hands of ministers' telephone numbers, among other things.
This was the application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, were being disturbed.
Several members of the public received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption, the application brought the public into the hands of politicians who were at the Conservative Party's annual mobile application.
The audience got access to profiles using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
Logging into the profile led you to look at and edit the stored material in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a while, and I called it a hit.
Michael Goven's profile image was changed to media mogul Rupert Murdoch's image.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the conference application allows login to other people's profiles at these email addresses.
Then the login person can look at the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The conference application made public the phone number of each journalist, politician and participant, Foster criticised.
The Conservative Party Publicist apologized for the data leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now functioning safely.
The UK Information Authority ICO supports the data leak.
The application was produced by the Australian Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the lack of confidence of the Conservative Party in security matters.
The Wall Finland audience has a large group of knocking Polish people every week
Accurate viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio general of The Wall Suomi.
The Wall, a rapidly expanding American format, came across the Finnish version of Nelose last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made in format.
At the Polish studio, the possibility of pictures was exceptional, as the size of a large 12-metre gaming wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the programme’s studio audience, which was besieged to be Polish.
There was a conversation on Twitter about whether Polish people might be sitting in the studio in Finnish for playing games.
UNNE Sormunen, the head of the four national programmes, will give an insight into the issue for the Iltalehähte.
He tells us that there are players close to the studio, other Finns, Finns living outside Poland as well as Polish viewers.
The public is made up of international artists in Finnish production, as is the audience of the The Wall episodes of other countries in the same production mode.
In Finland, too, there are so-called professional clubs that go through the descriptions of the different programmes.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if it is not a language to be played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are translations for foreign languages in the studio that perform the translation work.
There are two interpretations that interpret events as a simultaneous shut-off for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then directs the audience and tells us what kind of a note is being thrown there, for example, and what is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was performed in domestic production recently.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly replaced by a simultaneous interpretation, and he knew everything that was spoken of in the pictures in Finnish, the sum of Rings.
Japan’s southerly mound is moving toward the main island - the authorities warn against landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taifuuni Tram, but according to the authorities, the major injuries have been avoided and the victims of death are not so far known.
On the southern Okinawa island, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK General Radio Company, people have been evacuated into shelters and the electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the pilot trains are in places to stop because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka at half a day's time in Finland.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to the savers, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the past is darker than ever.
It's been a bad start.
The sky darkened almost as soon as the team disappeared on Saturday in its home field for Vaasa Sport, reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Portuguese now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points for the sixth round.
No US defenseman or two lower chain players have yet scored a goal.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
Sports against the audience was all over the place at the time when the game was almost half the time.
Six games have only been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be concerned, because we played that little bit.
Especially the second batch performance was shamefully bad, the Äss power 1+2 made Jarno Kärki told.
The victory for sport, of course, tasted.
The team had a game on Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible.
Maybe it did, but the Äss didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day Pirkko Hyvininen wonders the audience of the event at the large hall.
Somehow it thought that maybe this year not so many people would come, Hyvärinen considered in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the SM competitions were held at the same time as the bread day, so it might be expected that the number of people could slightly fall from the previous year.
In contrast, however, it happened; the corridors were blocked before ten, the sellers reported that the products had stopped, the news story was sold more than 500 doses and the number of cars also heard a rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen tells later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, there was a special amount of programme for families with children, which seemed to attract them to the record.
In addition, Hyjärinen estimates that the event will be further away.
The sellers also roam to Liper from a larger area every year.
This year, almost a hundred shopkeepers from the rapporteurs, handcrafts, bakeries and harvesters had arrived.
The bread day's mom, PIRkko Hyvärinen, loved the audience from the hall's audience.
The first harvest of the bread day was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
The winner of the red-bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäinen, celebrated the day in the torture scene.
7 x most beautiful lights - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for the decoration, and read the book untiringly.
You should bet on good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniem.
Do Your Eyes a Service
The importance of lighting is growing, the more years old are behind it.
A sufficient amount of light can help in the problems that many will experience with age when the accuracy of vision is reduced and the glare is becoming more and more acute.
Parents also need light to grow.
Six-quarters need light three times more than two decades.
It is therefore worth investing in the effects and properties of the lamp for health reasons.
A good light gives enough light, but it doesn't glare, some kind of hint.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful decoration can only be demonstrated with correct lighting solutions.
The interior designer of this moment is able to choose.
The favourite is Japanese style that combines gestureless, Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, in the 1970s, the inspired modern and playful retro style with strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream has risen to buum.
The truth fascinates the same way as in the interior of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Reveal Your Personality
On the other hand, more money is being invested in home than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to be tailored to their own homes, even the bravest lights that have a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we're very design-conscious, Jokinemi says.
Not the latest trend light, but the timeless classic that has been saved for many years, may be purchased at home.
Certain timeless, decorative and elegant classics keep their surface year after year, something says.
Thank you, and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are breaking up.
The Canadian terrorist played in orange music in a total of three league games with no power points, KooKoo tells in his press release.
In August, O'Donnell moved to KooKooho by means of a one-year agreement, which included a lasting trial period for the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played in KHL's Kunlund Red Star ranks as well as in KHL's farm in VHL's Heilongjiang.
There's no information yet on O'Donnell's new association.
Players want to show example in recycling - the goods go out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
Games speciality Pelimies is now also recycling packaging materials in addition to the games.
The products of customers in the stone shop are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
For example, products ordered from the online shop are packed in packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us go for re-use.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in order that it can be used, says Ville Puurula Oulu Player.
As a pewter material, the company uses mainly newspaper and other similar recycling materials.
The bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to move on to the recycling material in the envelope.
The movement wants to set an example to others as well.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an additional problem.
It's not a big problem. It's not a big problem.
It also comes with economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
The recycling is a natural fit for the player's activities, since in addition to new products, the movement's main product range includes used games and equipment.
Each fashion-conscious purchase: One shirt works in each suit
Classic clothing works from one year to the next.
They create the basis for a good wardrobe, because it is easy to assemble a variety of different costumes around high-quality classics in an affordable way.
The classics used in the wardrobe in autumn are high quality needles.
This category also includes black polo.
A black needle made of natural material with polar tubes cannot have an error acquisition.
The clothing can be combined with straight trousers, tylled skirts and jeans, and around it you can create both a restrained outfit and a sloppy style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trend watch comes from golden brown and wide speckle pants, black poolones and grey ankles.
The classic pooloneule, together with other classics, the blue-green scotch skirt and the red loafs, form a feminine and sophisticated costume.
Bring it to a black pooloneule by combining it with casual trendy garments: a jeanstock, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence sabotage has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence service SVR or military intelligence service GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking words "diversionno-razvedyvataja" group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The experts in the west of the Soviet Security Service (KGB) are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage attacks, says the archive manager Vasili Mitroh, who had fallen to the west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil processors and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired the DRG groups for cover operations for the Bundeswehr, railways, horsemen and road workers.
Russian paratroopers using this trike in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up inspection stations for you from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
The agents of the cold war hid supplies of mines, explosives, lighters and communication equipment for the sabotage groups.
Even in 1998 the KGB was found hiding in Switzerland, where it exploded when the authorities sprayed it with water.
The police reached out to four rads in the province at night
The police caught up on four nights between Friday and Saturday in North Karelia.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from the Gulf of Con was blowing at 1.57 per thousand.
At half past four o’clock at night, he drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanis.
On Lake Polvi, the Kurevarant, the car fell into the pit at four o'clock, and a 19-year-old local man in the car blew up 1.54 promile by the police.
There were no serious injuries to him while driving out.
A 20-year-old extra-urban man in the centre of the weird city car blew an alchometer at 1.33 percent.
The police suspect that these men will be involved in a serious road drink and that, in addition to the driver at Polvijärvi, there will be a risk of road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man who was driving a van at the crossing between the Oillands and Hoikantie blew up 0.52 per thousand.
He's suspected of having a DUI.
The police are asking for observations on the stabbing that took place after midnight at Turku railway station.
According to the police, a man was assaulted in the parking lot, representing the station with life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on the security camera.
Dark-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets immediately exited with a dark farm car in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left by bicycle in the direction of the center of Humaliston Street.
A pedestrian died after freezing under a bus in Por
In the porn, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident occurred after midnight in Raumantia at the time of the Neath.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
The police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps the risk in line for the rest of the time, the trial period for the magazine ended
Mika Wousala, the sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (center) has played an important role in the team's initials, underpower playing and the four-field defensive role.
In the trial, Filip Riska, who played for the first time, will continue to play for Hämeenlinna at the HPK for the end of the season.
The success of risk 33 in the roles offered to him was assured by the management.
Filip has been an important piece of work for us in the beginnings, underpower playing and the defensive role of the four-field.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to this experienced player, HPK sports director Mika Vouola commented on the club's news release.
The wish is that the value of the risk will rise when playing hockey league solutions.
Riska, a central attacker from the Pietar Islands, has previously played the league in JYP, Luka and Sport.
On the other hand, the striker Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probation period.
The reality today on TV: The climber was killed twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
Last night's movie was made on the basis of them.
Everest is now getting his first night on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating snow storm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's guidance for 2015 tells of the survival plan, which has been treated with cereals.
Tragedia has been made with movies and documents before.
There's a lot of real-life events going on here, too.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers’s life could have saved an eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of this, and as a result of air pressure, he lost sight, and the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey, and he didn't come back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only begun.
When the storm got up, he got lost, and he couldn't find him back in the camp.
When the man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
Like a miracle at the store, however, he still got to his feet and found the others.
The evil-frozen Weathers was supposed to still die, and once again he was left on the leash of his own happiness.
It's clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the climbers began to believe in the opportunity to give him help.
In the movie Beck Weathers, Josh Brolin plays.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is a celebration of the 200-year-old church of Eno
The 200-year-old church of Eno has been celebrated at the church mass today.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and for the celebration of Sunday the whole family was prepared.
The party began at the church church of Eno at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which an antimia of a cattle table was served in the church house of Eno.
The church was full.
There were 517 participants in the family meeting.
Eno’s church master Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy yet for a long time and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
Many people have been touched by the fire of the rise - risk church, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The church of Eno is now the oldest church in Joensuu’s evangelizer congregations, destroyed in the fire.
The tree church of the climbing hazard was completed in 1770.
In the morning, there was excitement in the rush, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The medicine flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-type storm came from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicine, is named Zorba.
The Institute for Air Science in Greece has provided a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The images taken from the area show plenty of floods all over Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how, between the houses, the city of Kiato in Corinthia has suddenly appeared instead of the street because of the floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the peninsula of the fear monstrosity, the wind caused a strong sea trip.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation invites the monitoring of weather information and instructions from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicine, brings down heavy rains and even floods.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 shows that only once or two years of medics occur worldwide, typically on September-October roads, when the temperature of the sea is still high.
Now the storm left the floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece for refugee camps on islands, such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by the earthquakes will also remain under the storm in Athens.
In Greece, my medicine was also raging last November.
You don't have to go to the sea now, you're still flying on schedule, on the Greek islands threatened by the fall storm, and thousands of Finns are on holiday right now.
It is advisable to be careful when walking to the sea, not to fly the branches or other bulk on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed to a good 3,500 people in Greece during the Finnish weekend on vacation through solar travels.
The instructions are needed, as even the storm of Zorbas, which is horrid, has been predicted to break down the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of Crete’s island, wind speed can rise in shrubs to 45 meters per second.
The heavy rains that increase the weather’s whimsiness.
According to the tour operators, all travellers from Greece to Finland who have reported their telephone number have been warned of the heavy winds by SMS.
In the air still the sun and heat
According to the solar communication expert Inka Ikosen, the worst has been avoided in holiday destinations by early Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and rose according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we've been monitoring the situation all the time.
Let's go ahead with safety.
I supported the media officer Antonia Schroderus tells us that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our target staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told us on Saturday about the early night.
Tuilla has a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers on the most popular islands in Greece, namely Rodox and Crete.
In addition, a few hundreds of passengers are on vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island will reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodoks had mocked the sun and the temperature was 27 degrees.
It is estimated that Zorbaksen will soon become huge in Turkey, although slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tuilla, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Hussi completely identical evening outfits in the mission - this is how they react to the situation
Media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-ended evening dress.
Hussi tells me he got a dress from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by runner Shirly Karvinen.
The two themselves also noticed the same costume and looked at the situation laughing.
Karvinen told her that she was busy preparing for the night, and she had to get on the plane.
Hussi works as a missionary backstage and red carpet drinker, and he talks to the most prominent stars on the scene.
Huss has a recent move behind him, because he moved from Kampi to Jäkäsaare on Friday.
So far, I'm gonna stay there, see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi considered.
Before I moved, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress broke, I got a flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi tells us.
Shirly Karvisen's attitude on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected the curious eyes of pensioners
The drinker and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told us on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final that she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland photos.
The speed has even been enough to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I made makeup and put the hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
I'm having an evening brief at home, Karvine's laughing.
Karvinen tells us that he pulled his makeup out in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also aroused the attention of travellers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes from the mirror.
At least my makeup was fun to others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that he enjoyed his plague as a designer of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience to date as being also stopping.
Karvinen tells us that he visited to welcome the single programmes on Friday.
It's kind of really raw.
They are people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How am I supposed to wear the upper knee boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothing is clothing that works from one year to the next.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals are fit.
A few years ago, the overcrowdings of the spring and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to their names, the boots on the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
The visible boots share the user's opinions, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
The superiors, in fact, fit whatever housing they want.
It's about a jeans, a pizza, a nice or a jersey, a leather or artificial leather cap on the boots.
The long boots look good both in the party-alooks and in the arches.
The black capers fit very well for the very small size of the habitat.
They adequately balance the pink, flowery plumage and modest, muddy needle.
Fresh but autumn-style everyday with a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro-retro.
Even though they have a certain fineness, they are perfectly suited for a relaxed everyday life together with a T-shirt, long shorts and a trendy box.
It's wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operated for the end of the year and take passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi robotic cars play the role of the bus simulator, as next spring the traffic on the robotic bus is to be started.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robotic cars can cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Head of Transport Management.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically between other transports without any special transport arrangements.
The driver is always responsible for the safety of the vehicles.
The vehicles constantly sense their environment with several different sensors and assess whether the highway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, snowflake, as explained by Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars travel all autumn three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robotic car stops recognize the stop markings.
You can probably get into the bus from the 1st stop in Otkare.

Let's hope for a quick recovery to the metal bridge!
The rest of the tour will be done with the backup, the pages will read.
Mokoma's fans respond to a worrying photo update in which Basti-Santtu lays a spark in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty much a worry that how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones are getting better over time.
A quick and quick recovery for Santu and a good tour for the other band plus the supporter!
And thank you for yesterday's great job, but do you promise to continue to leave off such strong drama jobs? writes a fan.
Police controlled hunting in North Karelia and Savona
The Eastern Finnish Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and Finland's rice centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police personnel reported on the social media on Saturday.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter had a hunting card and a hunting permit required in state countries.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons were reviewed, as well as the permitted quantities of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in the channeling process.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was seen during the inspection, who lacked a required hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned an unauthorized request for 12 days.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of having been drunk.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the criminal proceedings, police times.
To sum up, hunters respect the right to hunting very well.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone's permissions have been checked."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (coc.) will be travelling to Turkey to monitor the selection of future quota refugees to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from the Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a few times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment, the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organization (UNHCR) first selects people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressed position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and the sick, women and children.
More people will be chosen in Finland than there is in the quota, because in practice some of them do not arrive for different reasons.
The same is true of NGOs working at the border with Syria and Süleyman, the Turkish Minister of the Interior.
Ilkka Salmi, head of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
Speaking about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota for a couple of years was 1,050 years, but no agreement has been reached in the government since then on raising it.
The assembly has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has recently fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this term of government, a mute visit will be the first to be made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Previous Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (coc.) and Paula Risikko (coc.) were able to take up new duties before visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 in EU support for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hacks - no longer know if we're crying or laughing
Last Saturday, the Karelian announced a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law initially prohibits the holding of all animals which are not permitted separately by the regulations of the ministries as productive animals, pets or other business activities.
All other animals are, in principle, prohibited except for the animals mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill comes to law, it means that in Western democracies we are rejecting the general principle of the separate prohibition of action which endangers the security of society or the good manner.
We are now in the process of establishing a ban on all activities to which the law or regulation does not specifically permit.
The change results from the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and do anything else before the law or regulation adopted by it is adopted.
Government activity in lawmaking has generally been weak.
Now, if we go to the path where everything in Finland, in principle, is forbidden, what is not allowed separately, we do not know whether we are crying or laughing.
I don't doubt that the Animal Welfare Act would require an update.
But this kind of law project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think it will accept such a 'all things are prohibited, which is not permitted by law or by regulation separately'.
I hope there is a sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tip: Four trendy hams in autumn
This autumn's trend dress comes in snakes.
It looks particularly good in skirts.
Combine the snake-shaped skirt with the uppermost parts, such as the pool or the ordinary T-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn there is plenty of silk, and the silk skirt in particular is one of the most trendy items in the season.
Combine the gorgeous silk skirt finely with the female upper part or loosely as a pair of needles.
You can play more bravely with a silk skirt and throw a foot, for example, with skunks or the trendy cowboy boots in autumn.
It doesn't matter whether it's gray, brown or multi-tone, all the rose-sex skirts now belong to every woman's black-have fabric.
Merge boldly with different colours and also play with the screws on the top.
For example, the combination of the screw and the ball loss is beautiful.
Unsymmetrical pearls are a breeze of the lightness of summer that can be taken with them to autumn.
The unsymmetrical gem is feminine and playful at the same time and is perfect for the everyday as well as the party.
Alexia's baby, 3 months old, sweetly bruised in Jer's lap.
In Karalahti's family picture, attention to the center rises to the sweet three-month-old Alexia baby.
Nanna Karalahti tells us about the Aito day home set up for Kerava.
The sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family allowance at the beginning of July.
The first-born son of the couple, Jax, was 2 years old in May, while little Alex is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a Spanish Marbella training camp with Martina Aitolahti, which included the entire Karalahti family.
On Instagram, Nanna published a picture of the Spanish atmosphere in which the entire Karalahde family is positioned.
The children Jax and Alex are in their parents' arms.
I'm looking forward to a sweetly muddy baby, Alexia, who rests on Jere's father's arms.
Thank you for this.
Appreciate goodness, forgiveness, human generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti among the family potrets.

In addition to Karalahti, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisantti, who is responsible for the education sector.
Johanna Tervo was hired as head of the day home.
In Turkey is invited to download mobile phones in the event of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew up in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned in particular of the storm in Greece of seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast, CNN Türk writes.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
On Saturday, the disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure the functionality of Internet access so that people can get up-to-date updates, says the local Anadolu Time.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows and to move, for example, garden furniture out of the wind road.
Turkey is expected to be hard rain and the wind is expected to blow at 28-33 metres per second.
In Greece Red Weather Warning
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service provided a red weather warning to the regions of South Greece, Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies of Greece warned Finnish people in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also published a storm warning.
Passengers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, the wind was heavy and rained.
People were quite calm, communication manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui Travel Office told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, too, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the needy Finns.
In Greece, several ports did not operate on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, was told about the travel agencies to the STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disturbances were expected in air and sea transport.
It was reported on Saturday that the weather situation is being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason for Mercedes' better than Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too much in time for the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason for panic in Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was in time for the best part of the whole weekend, but they were just too fast, the fourth driven and their depositor Sebastian Vettel and the Mercedes-speed clearly left behind Räikkönen said.
Ferrari had a hard time already in the last race in Singapore.
A question was asked about the sudden fall from Mercedes' carriages.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
During the time-times, a rare treat was seen for Räikkösen's upcoming stable in the Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replacing the Räikkösen next season with Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also took the last time session.
For Swedish driver, the 10th starting point is best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers were completely missed in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging him in the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked off Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in the evening of Stuttgart was progressing in the steady signs.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he didn't get any good hits.
Clearly more extensive, Helen controlled the match with his hard bands, who found it well.
The Finnish was also clearly better in physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the resolution came in the eighth installment when Helen struck Teper on the left.
The hit was so hard that the hangman who had been fighting in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius was very moderate in fanning.
In his pedigree interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he switched to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We were brought in today.
Helen was delighted right after the match.
This was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps it would even be possible to get to the MM game, Helenius commented on the season before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before the Teper attack.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may increase
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country is calling for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Deputy President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
The rescuers are looking for those who have been trapped, as well as the dead from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port city of Returnu and the neighbouring town of Donggalasta.
So far all the victims are Back, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in fallen buildings who have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has been damaged.
Saviors tell of the cries of people trapped in ruins, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the beginning of rescue.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has appointed an army for rescue and grubbing-up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as in the disaster zone, electricity and telecommunications are in many places cross-border.
Fuel reserves are also coming to an end.
Miss Finland’s hesitant answer and lengthy reflection caused a laughter
Billnäs in Ruuk is currently choosing Miss Finland.
In an interview round, a question was put to each of the Missifinists.
The finalists pulled the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoske, 23, the hesitant answer brought about sweet, but benevolent laughs in the audience.
The question to Anttikosk had been raised via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book that the missionary has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
The public was given a break in the debate at the time of the laugh until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
I'm sure something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is an economics person, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski got the audience to excite the applause of laughter.
Anttikoski, formerly on a Missile, drew attention because she did not want to put on underwear for her principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 a.m. when the crown will be abandoned last year by Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple porridge cake will take you by language
This recipe is for you who have good, acidified apples from behind your own, for the domestic apple is in the store at shocking prices.
The pear may have to be bought, even though it is already growing in many people.
This cake can also only make apples if the pear does not want to buy.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if you also put the pear in the cake.
Shell the apples and pear and remove the seed cells.
You've got to stay out of it.
You can melt in a pot.
Add the eggs and sugar to the foam and melt the butter.
Combine corn starch, i.e. milk and bread powder and add them to the dough.
More almonds and wheat flour, mix well.
Sprinkle bread with bread paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar at the bottom of the mouth and spread pear slices on the top of the sugar.
He cut half of the dough over the pears and the apple branches over the dough.
The end of the magic was tossed on the apple fields.
Grow in the oven at 180° about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool down in the blood and then cancel the waiter.
Just cut the cake when it's really cooled.
The cake is a fragile structure and is easily crushed, as the cake has almonds and corn leaves without gluten.
Rua is organising an international crime fiction event in January
Kuusamo Ruka will be held for the first time in January, the International Literature Festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers as well as jazz music.

In addition to the Swedish names, there are also visitors from Iceland, Norway and Finland to the event.
Finnish writers at the event represent Max Seeck.
According to festival organisers, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo’s unique environment provide a framework for a unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
The researchers at Sydney University who have analysed the subject have identified two slightly different "coalities": generally attractive coolness and, in that respect, the opposite disconcerting-coal.
Interestingly, cool people had many socially desirable features, according to the description of researchers: they were outwardly oriented, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
For the alternativeists, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and blemish.
They were thirsty for experience, and they only cared a little about outsiders' estimates.
Both types combined a good sense of self and a stable emotional life.
The role of harden is not cool on longer: the high status of teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the American study published in 2014 in the Child Development magazine tells us.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good - looking gangs, and seeking favor from others, were at an increased risk of abuse and delinquency in adults.
In their human relationships, they were less successful than in their time with their unobtrusive peers.
The high-status-signposted slugs, badges or watches don't make a person cool or, at least, really attractive company.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, the vast majority of people were prepared to become friends with their usual market shirts than with those wearing their brand shirts, despite the fact that most people chose a brand shirt when they came to visit.

Reserve yourself if you live in the area of the Peloponnese, the Ionian islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on their Facebook pages.
According to the Grand Duchy, the Greek Air Science Service has provided the areas with a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported as a weather service in Forecan blog.
According to it, the toughest bushes in the storm are up to 45 meters a second.
Due to the comparison, the Kuisma storm struck Finland at the beginning of the week, with its peaks blowing at just 31 meters per second.
The blog says that the greatest concern of the Zorbas storm, however, is not the wind, it is the heavy rains.
During the weekend in Southern Greece, more than 300 millimeters of water can come.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Master Bottas was shaking and chewing adrenaline in Sotsh, will he be sent to Hamilton's help on Sunday?
Lord Bottas would shake for a little more than ten minutes after his gp pole ride in Russia when he was in front of the media.
A fine tour left the first star of Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton, and was certainly an important criticism even for the Finnish rider who has gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the settlement round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured out.
I've only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (in the middle of the year), so time has passed pretty much.
This track has been good to me before, and I got again good rounds.
It is not easy to bypass the Sochi track, so the departure is particularly big.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer the conversation whether he was winning tomorrow or whether he was jesating Hamilton, who was approaching the title of the MM.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you left the pole, Bottas poled.
But as a stable, we're fighting both championships.
Lewis' leadership Sebastian Vettelin is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it's got to be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, though, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was truly happy after driving, and Mercedes's stable boss Toto Wolffi also tasted.
Lewis had a plan to win the Lord, but he didn't succeed in the seven-year-old.
The Lord knows that he must tear everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was chewed out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To the question of whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive properly, Wolff answered the arguments.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning, see how the race goes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish Championship on the track
The Rallicar SM series has rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by the windmen Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg at the final rally in Turku and Salon, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen secured his career's best achievement when the third place in the final race sealed him from the SM4 category of the Finnish Championship for two-wheeled cars.
Honda Civic’s competing Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started at the main stage of Turku’s competition because the starting points were clear: an investment in the top group would be the back of the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twins had to give a balancing when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
It had to turn time blind for a third pin.
In such a situation, it is not suitable for the roost.
On Saturday, Jussi Tepo's speed was only followed in the second series, Kinnunen told us.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and war against terrorists is "almost over" according to him.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Friday in Germany that it is planned for October to hold a meeting with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey in addition to him.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court of Justice's drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who is on trial before the Supreme Court, received extraordinary numbers of people.
In the United States, at least 20 million people received the nomination drama of the Supreme Court judge with full effect on their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Donald Trump named Kavanaugh and Californian professor Blasey Ford, who was charged with harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee telling his story.
According to preliminary results, consultations were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers in six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
More than a million more people followed the online consultation.
NBC reported that the livestrim followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they made their year-long record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure rises by over 10 million, according to the count of those following the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made $8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are channels' own, TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but in any case, they are dizzy.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually only allowed to play sports matches and the great Oscar and Grammy Games in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as the President's speeches and in 2016 also presidential debates.
The U.S.'s most watched program, the U.S. football league's final match with the NFL Super Bowl, is definitely on its way.
This year Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel along the grid.
According to Nielsen, last year Trump’s first speech to Congress saw a total of nearly 48 million people and a fair 30 million people on duty.
What's the big deal?
In the United States, the appointment of the Supreme Court of Justice is an extremely important case, as the posts are life-long.
Trump was able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing the then President Barack Obama from appointing him as a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called 'va' language whose vote could resolve the position of the ninth-spirited court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, in his voice decided that those of the same sex were granted marital law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative.
His choice of the highest court may lock the court for decades.
Children have the right to have access to their parents
Only children under 10 years of age see the health data of their children on the Kanta Service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation in the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at small children’s health data or recipes.
This situation was provisionally corrected in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
After that, practices have been promised to correct, but the repair has been amazing for a long time.
Now the repair is under promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than the appeal case.
Then, with the understanding of the earth, it's a button-print: when you hold the stick, you open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has bank IDs or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is paid, and you don't even get a 10-year-old.
Thus, in practice, no one can see the four-grade data in a sub-school other than by asking them to be printed.
It's not about parents' rights, it's about children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child to have parents involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations where all things cannot be freely discussed.
They are often related to sexual health, from which freedom to care is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI started to close down the Kavanaugh harassment charges
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment charges.
One of the women was earlier this week in the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied charges of alleged sexual harassment in his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
I don't want you to go any further than a week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation into a more limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan
The attached bulldozer continued the bulging in the room.
The police tell us they put a man in a police prison to "rest up."
The police were attacked by a suspect in Kajaan on Saturday night.
The official will inform you of a case that started when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a brutal dispute in the central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the food business.
This followed the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by putting him on the ground.
When the third party got involved, the man hit him too.
Third-party assault led to the invitation of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaan to the police station. The police tell us.
The suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police report that they've passed through a man's prison to "rest himself."
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition from the official.
Subsidiaries are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawes - "The water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organisation (UNICEF) and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF in Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue operations, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF is always in full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue operations are underway in the city of Sulawes, but the situation in the Dongala region is slightly further north.
There are still places where connections don't work.
Assistance measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
The buildings are often light-weighted at Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter, for example, from tents, and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent.
For the first time, most people are able to offer water treatment tablets that UNICEF also has in store.
Water systems are to be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water will be transported first by truck, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and combining families is one aspect of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected for emergency aid will be used.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started collecting money to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Mr. Elon Musk, as the Chairman of the Tesla Government, will end the $20 million fine on the tweets.
The founder of space rockets and electric cars, Elon Musk, avoids fraud claims under an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will terminate his duties as Chairman of the Board of Tesla and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk resigns from duty as part of an agreement he entered into with the US Securities Market Authority.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud due to the arguments he sent in August.
In those Musk wrote that he is preparing the electric car company Tesla to withdraw from the stock exchange, which got the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to serve as Chairman of the Thessaloniki Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" of its government and take the two "independent directors" of its board of directors.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Muski.
Musk is still going to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal $20 million fines of the Musk, the Tesla company will also have to pay a $20 million fine to the financial controller.
The Tweets misled investors.
According to the SEC, the Muskin Tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private shareholder.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock market at $420.
Tesla's share price rose by more than 10 per cent a day after the tweets, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Muski's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
In addition, he had not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with the other management group or the board of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14 per cent when the Securities Controller SEC announced the fraud charge.
A new agreement is expected to confirm the company's price.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the bells of the court don't ring when the wise men don't move.
It's a technical defect.
The bell of the Church of Helsinki has stopped.
The wise show us 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt was a part of the exorcism and the struts were to be called to themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It has been visited by the repairer, but some part has broken and is expected to have a new part, Suntio Evelina Jamsen tells.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki on the Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last sentence is no reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
