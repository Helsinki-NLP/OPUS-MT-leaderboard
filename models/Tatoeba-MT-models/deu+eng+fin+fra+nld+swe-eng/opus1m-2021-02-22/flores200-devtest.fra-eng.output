This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already very widespread theory, but provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional disposition.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown oak on the top and pale or caroteneoid on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and barbules – researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The feathers structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for controlling or displaying the temperature. The researchers suggested that, although the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather rather than the down of a chick.
While scientists point out that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult, not a young one.
A trapped car exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and hurting more than twenty others.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin, put in a envelope a pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified their identity, the elector throws the envelope in the ballot box and signs their voter card.

Since 1988, ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by highly supervised volunteers, according to specific procedures.

His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish at the tenth place of the group of women sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first arrival, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth arrival.
In the category of women sitting skiing, four skiers did not manage to finish their course; with regard to giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race did not succeed in classification.
Madhya Pradesh police found the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
Assistant Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, Commissioner of Police, said that the accused had a hidden face when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit him, none was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The route of the accident was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the Red Audi TT driver.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
While she is in custody pending her review and trial, the eye evidence could be compromised as her portrait was widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered that the publication of photos was potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has informed journalists that no other comment will be made at least until the indictment is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley question.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees for a period of only five years.
Gunners in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers because the test was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is an interim manager of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four firefighters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained on safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the road to further elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
The department responded by calling the report "very regrettable" the adjournment by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 0719 local time (2119 GMT Friday).
The Mariannes North Island Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific tsunami Warning Centre stated that there was no evidence of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took hostage from the Hong Kong tourists by taking their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza pulled with his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Several hostages have been saved, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released prematurely, as have Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the baby's lung ripening.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager.Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more... I love her and she'll miss me... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the respondents share this view, and wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was to swim at 100 m and 200 m free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome his pain, as these were prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number known to date on January 25.
Several people checked the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed, and more particularly how the Earth has formed, since comets have been colliding with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month to legalize marriage between persons of the same sex.
He described rumours as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is believed that he will be presenting himself to the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, not on the ground radar systems previously used, which allows air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop in Wembley, and the parking spaces and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport has led to the possibility that the game can be played in private without the support of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the birth of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and from the University of Uppsala in Sweden have indicated that the new species has evolved in only two generations, although this process has been much longer estimated, following the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinson, Geospiza fortis, and immigrant beech pine, Geospiza conirostris.
We can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled to the end, which can be twisted and tightened. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be made very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand painted images in the books called "lit manuscripts".
This is what we call the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Chou juice changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with the clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water hunt in almost all the houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Residues of sewer systems were found in the houses of the small towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women were side by side.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 metres high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is making transportation much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other horses.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free company cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task dedicated to every feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called riots.
The bats consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with a large number of sisters and daughters in their families.
Lion troops act as packes of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other great felines) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and draw with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (Gree Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones able to row.
The tearing of the tiger does not look like the expanse of the lion, but rather like a sentence whose words would be screams and melts.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, the ocelots track and find the animals to eat (bees) through the smell, relieving their journey on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very furtively. The ocelots track their prey based on their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population of which it was born (e.g., if it moves over a mountain chain or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return backwards), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new features or adjustments to be a powerful competitor compared to what it had previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "specification", which simply means the formation of new species.specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exile (i.e. expiate).
The plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We manufacture our home and our plant-based clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals would not survive.
The mossaure was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing, except the other mossaures.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth as razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not size against it.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual feast dishes, such as leprechauns, peacocks, snails, as well as laurels, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they were resting on the side while they were eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these American or Asian foods that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Because there were no large forests on Canaan's land, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found the Greenland — and so appointed — by travelling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, esquimaude tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "scandinavian", there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776” could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The disembarkation of day J and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Free France Americans and Forces had freed the south of France and headed to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term " civilisation" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civilian and which is related to the Latin words "civilis", which means citizen, and "civilis", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
The cities-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between States.
The articles required unanimous consent from all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most titrated team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, escrime, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, the Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" from a geographical point of view.
The first information concerning Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European browsers passing through it made mention of it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat during the first Japanese war (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which he handed over the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the three window hall.
Most of the contiguous buildings in the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continued to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world is the 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photo sensor format of digital cameras.
The size 35 mm is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family) are equal to or closely related to this aspect report.
The rule of third parties, badly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that gives dynamism while offering image protection.
He indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion has linked the European States to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the rotor.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Great Britain is mining international waters in order to prevent ships from drifting into entire maritime areas, thus representing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only caused a shy reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its sea war without limits.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a inclination for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different times; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there has also been an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the time of the Three Kingdoms which took place for 60 years between the dynasty Han and the dynasty Jin.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloody times in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'year.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual slopes of Muhammad.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When you get into the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. From the inside of the cave, very few things in this universe can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Gizeh plateau, or "Gizeh Necropolis", in the Death Valley in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol "to push" looks like a V and the symbol "to shoot" looks like a staple or square with a missing lower side.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the arch, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the arch) and pull the arch.
An archet to the top usually produces a softer sound, while an archet to the bottom is stronger and stronger.
Don't hesitate to write your own marks on the pencil, but don't forget that the printed archet brands are for a musical reason, and that they must be respected in general.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Miss Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a bunch of salesmen.
In a carross, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shout and shout threats against the king and the queen.
The king and the queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their bodies.
At some point, a crowd member burned the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial system to cover much of the expenses and interests of the obligations issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the extended exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the XIth to the XIIIth century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperatives to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also has a greater impact on road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism was an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichete and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would have been preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was regarded as that of feudal Europe.
His reputation as a luxury epicentre began around the year 400, and lasted until approximately 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were once again charged with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style had its apogee between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, east.
However, owing to the slow pace of communication, Western modes were able to charge a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing.
Livestock farming is a farming practice that produces sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livestock farming is a simple, often biological system using seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signify their belonging to a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manieuisms and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, grief or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered ferocious or wild; some wild children have been locked up by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a serious mental or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When completely raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within their physical limits) that are almost identical to those of animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but more a means of helping learners who discover new learning such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but Microsoft Office’s little trombone man is one too.
Virtual layouts are integrated into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, through extradition.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care placement system is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care placement is expected to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usage and compliments.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's speech, indicated how people who could not understand the speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such capacities for interpreting human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes the reserve of the variations expressed.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variation between the two basins at each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (food, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little the same as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional wake-up during your sleep period and drowsiness shortly thereafter (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent wake-up, in order to make you reconscious without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of the bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based options include drinking plenty of liquids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known as diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the opportunity to find an absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach the illumination. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the mahayana love path and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awareness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through substitution armies, on battlefields in both Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retire and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost from day to day, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most effective means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Marines' work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfereing with the ability of your enemy to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean with soldiers and equipment to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that would wander on hills or other pasture areas, often treated by herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been conducted today.
The "carways" were built in England from the 16th century.
Although car tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and to draw higher loads than on slightly more accidental roads of the day.
Cruises were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a strip of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was the walk: humans stood up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopitheques, were not standing as usual.
Bipedes were found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to alleviate the suffering to come.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a manuscript project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house on a few streets.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed-reds, which are very suitable insects to pester humans.
Reductions, as well as bed rouges, are nidicols, i.e. suitable for living in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the U.S., there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (SEP), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their interest, or in the child's interest, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is the guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimenting, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, ask questions and make observations, but also directs scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to death of cells or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to those who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to get to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science is now showing that this carbon-based economy has outlived the biosphere of its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, there are few complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and of their interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
The insects were the first animals to fly away. Their ability to fly has enabled them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemeral.
A few thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes 10 km wide.
Not less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Gizeh pyramids were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City is drafting its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemicals such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: the earth, the water, the air and the fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that the latter transform themselves into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil size.
You can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms the energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like digging a hill with a heavy cart. By dividing the core again, then releasing a bit of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is finer at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is finer. It was easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
The theories of the content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or they are attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been interiorized as they matured toward adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, pushes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the theory of Maslow's needs hierarchy and the theory of the two Herzberg factors.
In general, two behaviours can arise when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is trying to remain "good friend" (or girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into a ungrateful individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in its own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose itself the tiring process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, lesions, tumours and traumas affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies enables us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science-fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automation by task machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include monitoring, planning and programming, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focusing on the contribution of solutions to everyday life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been planned in several home computer and video games software.
The excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outputs. Students can look at the old objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb artwork while sitting with their class.
Taking part in an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as albums.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blog's experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having a public usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical public, the blog author is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "enforces students to become better acquainted with the world around them." The need to raise public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When in fact they are in good use, blogs "may enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical minds: by actively responding to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on specific topics" (Orvec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art and museum galleries that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south you will find the falls of Niagara and to the north, the region of Muskoka and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these, and many others, are doing from Ontario what foreigners consider to be Canada's quint essence.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent alone, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury resorts.
The Arabs have also brought Islam's practice to the land, and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco of Gama discovered the Cape Road linking Europe to India.
To the north, the area is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels to say that she is married regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours which they consider to be harassment, as they are often followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to hold good (cultural differences or no, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the tenth century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Mérinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt and baptized Casa Branca after destroying it, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to make purchases.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, potterys, maroonware, narguiles and beards of all kinds, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located to the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorillas in the least expensive mountains of Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to travel in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at Risk because of the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" program on PBS.
The city strongly contrasts with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic style than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located north-east of South Africa, along Mozambique's eastern border, from Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most popular attraction parks in South Africa and is considered the fleuron of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and retention rights for the park.
It can be advantageous to get a Wild Card that gives access to some parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island has its name in Hong Kong territory and is the main tourist centre of interest.
The row of buildings that draw the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a sparkling bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of the port of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the sea front of Kowloon located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the ground on the northern shore.
This is where the British settlers have invested, so I think it's a good starting point if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past in this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not merely mangrove marshes: they also contain some of the last remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/merchage areas.
Sundarbans is a natural reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 tigers of the Royal Bengale and 30,000 deer stained.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese cabiners, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a bridge in the Oyapock region of Brazil. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres tall; it is 378 metres long and has two tracks of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was only opened for circulation in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The Guaranís were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or picking.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant Indian province”, was born of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Polo's Asociacion Argentina.
The official currency of the Malouines Islands is the book of the Malouines Islands (FKP) the value of which is equivalent to a sterling pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged to the only island bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The sterling pound is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it may be that the British and American currencies are. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Maloines' money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical areas and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are no really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are wild species; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals must be kept!
As dociles as they may appear, bison, moose, oregnal, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous naval deadlock in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered at a peaceful gathering held in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and range northwards from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Bathing is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink water from the local tap without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to security warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the boxes arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would deviate.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking gives the traveller peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transportation, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also reserve the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or provide you with other documents needed for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any change or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late in the night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, because ice crossing can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks found there, and outputs can be difficult to identify.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in the right mood and to keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkness interferes with judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On ice and snow roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on the naked asphalt.
During the blizzards, it may fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powdering or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In the current language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African soil, especially in savannah, with the aim of attending the striking show of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lions, guends and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A walk safari (also called a "brousse walk", "padest safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the report was announced, you may face a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes makes it easier to dry them. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be lent, even if there is no iron in the rooms.
If you don't have iron to iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the tissue overheat (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different water purification methods, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to cook water for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a known company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread of venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to buy exempt goods from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, often passing through isolated lands from the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow paths and tight curves dominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbours, Austria.
Fruit pastry is usually served there: apples are cooked and cooked all year round, while cherries and plums point the end of their noses in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, nuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry very well with a cup of coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the balls of Berlin, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to the regions.
A curry is a grass- and spices-based dish, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia, with 17,000 islands, is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javan cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours that the Javans prefer being cocoa, peppers, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stables are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on each side of the seat.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: in fact, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a horseman is projected from a horse, but has a foot taken in the stride, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear horse boots with a smooth and narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a sticker to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the mountain panoramas are breathtaking. Mountainers from all over the world continue to discover new, practical paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding to take off a snow-covered runway with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski booms", which organize their whole holiday according to the ski in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years ago!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational skiing club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but it does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on the affected terrain and which require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little further than on foot – but you will only rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on down-tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In conventional circumstances, travelling across several countries therefore means having to make multiple visa applications and to undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without ironing through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to request a visa separately for each of the Member States of outer space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years of age as antiques.
The criteria vary according to the place where one is located; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Crafts may be considered as antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
The breeding of reindeer is an important means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as herd animals.
Today, many Souls practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the sociable region.

The opinions presented are often superficial, general and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent time is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social changes or loss of human lives.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are storms, tornadoes, marine trombes and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snow storms with violent winds, and storms of sand or dust.
Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this may affect the routes they plan.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search of "Hospitable Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role plays, much of the first aid, and sometimes arms handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex-change operation abroad must ensure that they have in their possession documents that are valid for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the name and sex desired varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is also variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scanners by preserving their privacy and dignity.
Breaking currents are the currents that come back from waves that break on the beach, often on a pile or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep waters can be formed.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim backwards, which may not be possible.
As soon as you get out of the current, the return to the swim is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you have been identified or not, you may want to wait for the help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honey moon phase is less long), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty re-adapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be as necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound and light at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show begins.
Usually we hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a book of history.
The Sphinx is placed as the background canvas and the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the Island of Livingston and the Desception, where the caldeira flooded with an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the mountain range of Ellsworth, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The north side, or Sentinelle, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote places, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by shipments that require data transmission at a distance and telephone.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those planning a Sabbath year have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them choose this opportunity.
This is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
Often, having attended sabbatical courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of doing higher education in your country.
In general, enrolment fees are required to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Recreational navigation is a national time pass in Finland, due to a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is between one and forty).
Most of the cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterized by a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only travel on land with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the above map, Berlin is not at all located near the seafront and no visit of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never stolen before or experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is not different from the fears and personal fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about aircraft operations and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or the fact that not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver fast deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repair, the issue of time limits is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air cargo, on some routes, it would have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get this done faster was to send it as a registered baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel first-class or business-class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, to ask your business to do so for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it is unnecessary to seek reductions for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very dearly the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their tariffs in knowledgeable terms.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but the Russian language is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent correspondence platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrne is today a modern, developed and living commercial center, located around a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern commercial centres are paved with traditional roofs in red tiles, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews regardless.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that they are the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being self-centric, gross and arrogant.

The national park of the lakes of Plitvice is densely wooded, mainly bees, spices and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The area also houses a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the brown bear of Europe, the wolf, the eagle, the hive, the lynx, the wild cat and the great tetras can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stars to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and in addition to its bright colors, you will be entitled to a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Like men, wear pants covering their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from the warehouse at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Majorquine cuisine, such as similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.

All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a nounous form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be monitored are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the next vowel.

However, those who speak a little Spanish could quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to ensure that it is not necessary to study it separately.
The pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at their time was not as worrying as today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, easier access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructure located in remote areas where air conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry flowers, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of the cherry trees were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the aristocracy near the Imperial Court.
The plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove them if only "one".
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the sampling of "species" will also have you evicted without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once arrived on site.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong radiation of the sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of Bible patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish colony of Kyriat Arba.

There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, congregations often breaking into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals could not go after the trip, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man at the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the boreal aurora, for the sky will be dark almost all day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one to which Westerners can be accustomed.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their family name or function.
Harmony at the workplace is crucial, as it focuses on collective effort rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to get the agreement of their superiors for any decision they take and are supposed to follow their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
