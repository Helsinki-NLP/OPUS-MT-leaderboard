Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez skipped a helicopter over Bogota, the capital of Colombia on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it went 160 km/h over the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many baths had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the road infrastructure at a low rate, many of them come up with a solution in the form of a small black box that stands above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile of a motorist's journey and transmit the information to public servants, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to reform the obsolete system of financing the major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of planning of major axes has suddenly led to a lively debate and energized alliances.
The libertarians joined environmental groups to put pressure on the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel, and then to use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Freedoms Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of Congress are unable to reach agreement on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for ways in the next decade to move to a system that allows drivers to pay for the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turnaround.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to begin recording the miles travelled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes paid by Americans to the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are no longer buying as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The fuel tax is simply not acceptable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this from user fees to mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the urban Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set out in the state's ambitious climate change laws.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Proponents of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay at the mile.
"It's not just a tax in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go along the road of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would cover approximately 10,000 cars.
But the President of the Chamber killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to work or to town.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state kilometre fees instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smallest steps and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and such things are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at Nevada Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada CALU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full location devices."
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily journeys and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location and time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company did not intend to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to break through the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have benefited the planners of the major axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you do not record and locate their speed," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have equipment at all, preferring to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing appliances to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay the parking fee, provide a "drive payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on the mile payment is not just a huge diversification.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the Bay of San Francisco area, the officials say that Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be taxed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that each pays its fair share.
"There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unpublished listeners
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he completed a luxury re-edition scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the screen.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone hostage.
On the day of his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, date 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to have the pop scene cut.
A feast for his fans
Don't be surprised, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will take the form of three discs: the original album, new studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five specially dedicated songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and bags, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a sparsely controlled rock electricity.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrying intro before a light cavalcade that gradually slows down to allow room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even Gravity?
With this played title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enveloping, are eager to leave the Earth.
Bowie at least enjoys playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-to-turn informant, man on board a rocket, potential Martian...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising, therefore, that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, of the Louis Vuitton brand, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and emphasized that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before they were released, the members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the military's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a range of tasks - to reach the 10 year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadien, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay for another year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who said to a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service for retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesman for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to give the tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney's channels is scheduled to take place only in 2014, and details the release of its Disney Junior Division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of an American western city where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode consists of two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence prosecutor, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: "Although my efforts have clearly been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, saying the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In connection with the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with spying and stealing of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, said at Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany has been severely tested following complaints that NSA had been listening to the cell phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States", it would have to be taken advantage of.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green MP, published a photo of him on his Twitter account with Mr. Snowden.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that, according to counsel from the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the MP.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world and senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter provides an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix on demand video service via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows the lead of its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date in relation to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
The Rogers Telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16th.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It's been about two and a half years since we've been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions as a new framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been consulting the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decrease in net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The Montréal-based company explains this decline by cost of depreciation related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
In December, Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for a total of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They amount to 1.8 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from the 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues rose by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of clients of Cogeco Cable is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of clients fluctuating like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in canned beef-based products, sold by two small, low-price British distribution brands, today announced the Agency for Food Hygiene.
Regular tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the UK agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a driver who was moving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal at around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for baggage by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened canoe with them to the descent of the plane.
New baggage charges apply to bags in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier Spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to have this price paid," she explained.
Airlines started paying first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These fees are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new expenses will not really be used to raise money.
It is about making the customers of Frontier the most faithful that it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers buying tickets at the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the tail at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand luggage costs will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often rouse about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not affected baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first charges for hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost Algerian company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, who closely follows the surcharges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently travelled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the unusual baggage charges imposed by the company.
"I had never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see tooth crimps and a fight burst at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning."
Frontier also acts as Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for baggage when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his final effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the miles premium by 25 per cent on one trip.
For example, a 1000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal customer in his home city, Denver, but his activity is back and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, based on the financial results released on Wednesday by its parent, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to correct Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA challenges an "internal error" and not computer hackers for failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shade said Friday it was a bug that caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," said the spying agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to an attack on distributed denial of service [DSD] were false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overburdened and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system.
The NSA once ultra secret, a time nicknamed the "No Search Agency", has been under fire from the projectors and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at the national level and abroad – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disfellowshiped consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-City now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to drop its employees.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Working Relations at the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition was very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he would sell it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day within two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge with fracas in January for the partial resumption of Amiens-Nord's Goodyear site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, is today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive recovery, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After abandoning the plant's purchase project in January, you are returning today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "wrong" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this flash-face.
Is it to please Mr Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxation and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours of work is disabled in France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours of work a day.
But I have no prejudice over France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to enlarge.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closing of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting benefit, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan is buying Goodyear's closed plant.
Therefore, Titan could move machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them from the approximately 1,200 existing employees of Goodyear.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on departure benefits for all employees.
Therefore, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on departure benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give job-time guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in reaching agreement between the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buying the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The profit of Bombardier decreased, while deliveries and orders of aircraft declined
Bombardier Inc., Canada's aeronautical and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and from contractual issues in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of commercial deployment by next September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the pilot only stole three times, and the question was then whether the test phase was on track.
Results were not consistent with forecasts and the share price declined by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doersksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from "overperformance" to "sector performance" on Thursday due to low stock market growth potential over the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although much of the decline in aircraft deliveries has been anticipated, we are truly disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation Division," said Cameron Doerskens in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight trial program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew out for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest to 177. It appears that potential buyers are awaiting the results of flight tests to validate the company's assertions regarding the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial launch of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the programme was moving forward in line with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly out in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly afterwards, said the company.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was evaluating the in-service schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This delay in flight tests – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerskens.
In the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted result by action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 million to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that he delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared with 83 before.
The delay in the Aviation Division was $32.9 billion as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues declined by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that revenues from this division increased from nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transportation Division order book totaled $32.6 billion as at September 30, a slight increase over December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from performance problems with respect to some large contracts.
The leaders announced that further indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's course of action, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to $4.83 Canadian in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third largest aviation manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists were missing in a gouffre under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, we learned on Friday from the Speleo relief of Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to practice and the other no, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were then without news from them since, specified the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, Technical Advisor to the relief speleo in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on site
Some twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Speléo relief, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firemen were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, forwarded the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Chasseurs, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps pending the rescue, specified the prefecture.
Feeded, they should come out of the cavities with the help of the emergency workers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
On Thursday, the German Journalists' Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations on U.S. and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice," she says in a press release.
She found the Washington Post information "scandaluses", according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected masses of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union, who claims 38,000 members.
Redemption lights: a Member asks Brigitte Grouwels to resign
The minister Brigitte Grouwels' draft "relifting" of the lights poles in Brussels does not like everyone.
As a reminder, Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in central Brussels a test project to re-establish 16 signposts of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is in the long run to re-establish all the Brussels signage lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "department" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with the crazy spending of Bruxellois' money on relifting the Brussels region's coloured signposts, Brigitte Grouwels continues his flamandizing of the Capital," says De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally repeated herself in dark-blue-black the Brussels poles.
According to the MP, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Bruxellois deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who himself implements the NVA program.
It is high time to stop the Trojan of Flanders horse.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Bruxellois!", concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico de Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The ecotax portico de Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents at this tax took place on Saturday, was disassembled Thursday morning.
The cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and the traffic on the national was diverted into the stream.
The dismantling decision, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was made by Ecomouv, Port Manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax portals in operation in the department of Finistère, with the other two being dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed goggles.
They can thus acquire a hearing aid, a charger or another storage box.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for 50$.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibre or an intra-auricular earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him here,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frace it."
There is no recipe, no way of using it to pass the invisible wall and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of its presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle wake up in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my gestures on a daily basis.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought on the day I found her empty body, crawled into that hospital bed with smudged sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial adieu focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small diurnal or nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that believed in mourning.
And then she turned out all the while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost my mother's person but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect life and released the person I loved, and behold, I found her full and full.
This diversion from my life's path remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that beloved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and outside," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was ill...
He was talking to me, encouraging me all the time, living in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said the dead were not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I keep dreaming of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me to the contrary and register in my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was standing out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the level and he was smiling and glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happy to share what happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am happy to share this common memory after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor's house that I was at the time.
Despite everything, I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learn Arabic and interest me in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, have not been, with the retrogression, anodinary choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled me are always present, so that I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a life-saving spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself alone, anywhere, at any time, in unusual places, uncongregational moments.
Then time eased the pain.
Only the lack, this empty without response, the need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me of the hollowness of her gentleness.
But she's there, silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes standing on me, I see the deer who tightens his eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front on the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
Its protection is constantly felt, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually got a smile again, and saying his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hole of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites herself in my dreams when morality is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in the difficult moments, the decline in time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the path she had set for us.
If a being has loved you very strongly, the absence cannot tear it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend his funeral, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have different beliefs about hers, I always wonder if my actions are in line with her vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in a different direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he's there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
Of course, the immense pain that has invaded me has eased, but it is still near me.
Very often it "disappears" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that at the awakening I am even more saddened to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up, anxiously, and I lit the headlight by looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to point out that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be with us and to support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it is going to expand, and what is happening in Syria is going to expand as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded signs that accused him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide assistance to him.
Cocainoma lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarborough
Counsel feared that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed to the public.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarrough concerning investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromise because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "first-rate case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with fellows.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Datta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed to the public.
Today, at the Liverpool court of sittings, Ditta, who works in the law firm of Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, disbanded after being convicted on two charges of obstructing justice after a trial of three weeks.
He admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, up to 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a football stadium in Ewood Park, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied the use of cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and taken from him a sample of hair.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients would call him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of which it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If anyone has to know that the law must not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the investigation of the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He has been too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and has let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal conduct and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr.Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr.Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he began to get drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backgrounds of the senior members of organized criminal groups who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr.Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of cocaine possession and now hinders justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminals in court.
That this case be used as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and you'll translate in court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the MotorCity Casino.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seaboard covered with a light coat: you could get the warm blow in Menton with the bill of illumination.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is more settled by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To ease costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 wounded.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff went to the exits or on the tarmac.
The police quickly intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
From the classical song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school customers who will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, are allowed to get a grip on classical singing.
In addition to this performance, the Royal Lyric Art Society will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the room of the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the Lyric Apo, the concert-benefit held last August, with the participation of the soprano colour Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a benefit activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft in the ears as an air of bat.
Without giving any precise figures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future stands out well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are running and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years," commented the administrator.
"I'd even say beyond," added Director General Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, sequestration, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reaction of the police involved and their ability to start the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of the incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet through a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the St. Joseph's Oratorium as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", which was allegedly masturbate in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Somis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratorium Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal concerned only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I was in that place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has a special feature of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been committed by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the St. Joseph Oratorium, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be committed against children", "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on victims", "have been aware of and nevertheless stifled by sexual abuse, and have "consciously and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective action must first go through the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the Court's admissibility has been granted, the second stage is carried out, the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the district of LaSalle, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The aid was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cooking restaurant on Avenue Dollard, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the site took nearly an hour to control the brewer.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the chief of the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on stage.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this storehouse, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might need to be temporarily housed, said SIM.
Many opposition to medical help to die at Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the proposed Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec.
It is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If there was a focus on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des care palliatives du Québec also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she regrets.
According to Suzanne Fitzback, the majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, felt that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the lead.
For her part, Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the notion of end-of-life should be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press goes against controversial media law
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask ourselves the following question: what will the Parliament prevent the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?", said the newspaper contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is drastic and very punishive, and we refuse to do so," explained Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent news radio stations and websites.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "maintain the media." The Standard, in turn, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "have suffered a hard blow" and fraughted the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill coincides with a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media have aroused the anger of the authorities by disseminating images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were defaming the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn after a closure of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be fined up to 20 million shillings in Kenya, and journalists up to 1 million at the additional risk of being "deleted" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations".
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animate blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Build to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission for Wages and restored their mirror wages by about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A year difficult for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval has caused a great deal of emotion to the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
There were almost 30% of the required staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the department's head, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We have not resorted to troubleshooting, explained Mrs Beaudet.
Some of our activities have been rationalized or reduced within the level establishment, the time things are changing.
It is certain that we have worked hard to get our young [residents in pharmacy] interested in coming and staying here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 is much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists return to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain it have borne fruit, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it's much better, stressed the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
That will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of people] is always precarious, because we have a youthful environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always roll at three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more and there are no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama egrene, in eight chapters that will emerge in two stages (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenary that has been accorved to sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a brindilla silhouette, a diaphane complexion and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay bare on ice paper will show up in far more sulphurous situations on a large screen.
A Nymphomaniac extract raised the temperature on the screen: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in full ecstasis with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their incompetence in the closet, he had recourse to X professionals for the most daredrous sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last cuts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A Chamber of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at Narbonne's CGR Mega, as a precautionary measure, as a result of pickling the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility carried out the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on tear jet bottom?
Or involuntary incident?
It is still that the directorate of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers.
The room was ventilated and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman has tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in lemons at Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning.
It was during the passenger baggage examination that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three previously drained lemons.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took the lead in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation," said Jacqueline Roby, the CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, 173 drug seizures have been carried out by border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1653 drug seizures were carried out by border services officers in the Quebec Region.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short SA-8-range soil-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new air raid from Tshahal in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in similar circumstances to that of July 5th: at that time it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time aimed at Yakhont ground-sea missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation from seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investment.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P showing at least one chance in three that it will be reduced again by one year.
"It is increasingly likely that the government's strategy will provide sufficient foreign exchange guarantees to meet its high external financing needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and anticipates that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits made abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities resorted massively to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapses, the agency considered that a devaluation was increasingly likely, which would increase its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been demanding the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had provided it with an appropriation of $15.3 billion and has currently made available only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while underlining "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," said the expert, interviewing the AFP, as the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015.
The only hope is to improve the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of the opponent Iolia Timochenko.
"Reporting the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, representing the quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
United States Green Fire at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said that on Friday they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus coming closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review deadline for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, planned by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", the two groups announced in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the time-limit for examination provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other courts fulfil several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
The Congolese army chases the M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the northern Kivu forests and mountains bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being chased from the north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and accuse it wherever it's hiding because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, Spokesman of the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganise because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the communities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way alter his claims to peace talks.
According to Ugandan mediators, they resumed in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
The hills that dominate Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, are marked by a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the leak of the government garnison and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's most important in terms of numbers, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malavian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was re-engineered and the army took the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is today unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be touching at its end," predicted an expert on Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, who deny it forcefully, of militarily supporting the M23, which was formed from former mutinated Congolese military.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hage, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisal following the shelling of Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the people of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day freed by the army," says a resident of this neighbouring locality of Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported a fall in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in withdrawal from the Group's objectives.
His net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, one year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced one year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpj for this year, with 25% of the expected production growth by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) decreased from $45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a net decline in profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
Transport of coal: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) has been requiring fees of $150 per student (up to $300 per family) for students in two-residence school transport, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," Lefèvre explains.
In her view, the CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for further time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to work together and to find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation was part of a complaint process.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu emergency
In the face of the freony conducted for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, on July 10, decided to "decelerate the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies which will not be able to take place on November 4".
A formal request "to avoid any risk of taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed to avoid hampering the PS campaign to a few months of municipal women.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Even if APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, about one quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings to the Hotel-Dieu emergencies will all have received orders to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency specialized interns will allow for five general medicine interns to be held on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is programmed for the current of the month.
"The Hôtel-Dieu emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," assures Loïc Capron, chairman of the PAHP's Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he said, claiming the permanent presence of Smur vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, he also ensures.
But it is for the SRA to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are gradually happening," said Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for which, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," complains urgent physician Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed of his position as head of the SMAR at the beginning of July for having led the fright against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warranter" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are evacuating and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly ingested.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting for Lariboisère emergencies.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" at several sites are not likely to represent "alanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already underway since October 7 and is expected to continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also participate in the establishment of an "ambulatory care facility".
"Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose themselves," says Gérald Kierzek, who is "dangerous" and "medical regression."
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternitys.
People are not crazy, they go where there is the best care offer.
If the minister doesn't take action by Monday, we'll change the briquette, Christophe Prudhomme, urgent physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Paris UMP advisor and elected from the 4th district, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would see her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable schedule of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says a U.S. official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the NSA's listening affair after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about this, a U.S. official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of the anonymity, this officer did not specify whether such supervision had been established in the past.
Another official indicated to him that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at approximately the same time as the one ending listening to the Onu headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations is now beginning to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, prior to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, to be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and become an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I would do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
The security-related concern in Mozambique is growing with conflicts between powerful figures
At the foot of Samora Machel's statue, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scandalize peaceful slogans at a rare public event.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Director General of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her workwear against a t-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd who were raised on the square of the capital's independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst ever since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by whites and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the north-west could attract over $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italie and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually reject the responsibility of tensions.
The Renamo states that the government is responsible for the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government made Renamo responsible for the outbreak of conflicts and accused him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, Mr. Guebuza told the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces left to him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that the Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions generated by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a speaker from Mozambique's open and specialist university.
None of them knows well how to negotiate and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mr. Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where is Beira, the port from which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was wrongly shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," he said.
Instability has reinforced the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People believe that the people in charge of the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the government to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's Legend might show that "the brutal force does not weight the subtle ruse," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for a "tight selection" of works adapted to age.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactic" means that the children "take off completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
One Hamas army fighter was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and safe sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they hit an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: the United States is "going too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington confession in full polemic with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and denial between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I agree with you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this will not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated since Washington on Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the intelligence and information-gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the US authorities that many of the attacks had been undertaken since then, through interception of communications and information collection.
"We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects upstream," the US diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived".
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured President Obama on Thursday evening that he was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one felt wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to flare this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program named "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British homologue of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibres used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that NSA has been massively intercepting data and communications from allies from the United States and its leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. President was unaware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would be about "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would not be Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And polemics spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage that has also aroused the anger of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his credit master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the club of Ligue 1 in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this 12th day game, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The press release simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned from his selection at the beginning of the month.
A Memorial Ceremony of the Crematized Disappeared
At 11 a.m., Father Lachaise's crematorium organizes a secular ceremony, in memory of all the late cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Council, has to attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals for funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obscetics, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6th and 7th among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsciss of a loved one, this is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the shame of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cream.
In her book La Mort en ashs, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee for the Ethics of the Funeral, emphasizes the "violence" of cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "be accompanied by the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "disposal of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," said Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Appreciating Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to get to grips with it.
Appreciating the cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, providing for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would have been entitled with an burial.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of the atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade now, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who, in the presence of the body, carry out the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, appointing the deceased, linking him to others, referring to him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the adieu.
This has been the case at Fr.Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is within this framework that Father Lachaise's crematorium, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, organizes several ceremonies of memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted to the attention of those who could not move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, re-housing for rats turns to polemics
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Terres du Sud Habitat Office proposed, on an exceptional and provisional basis, that the couple and their three children be remanded in a T4 nine.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken too many proportions, says Joël Canapa, Director of the Office.
Rats, there have always been in the cities.
The deratization company makes two steps a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
This has been the case since the end of last winter, with 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to abandon, and the rats do not pull in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats one will not kill a kid.
"We did not invite rats to our house," defends the father who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without the noise and we expect new accommodation at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating was affected by the decline in the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to export values and the warning about its annual outcome launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei Index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and Topix transferred 11,23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house with flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames appeared in a house of three houses spread over four floors behind the court of the Seminary of Quebec City.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled one hour after the firefighters arrived, many of them to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it is the buildings glued here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec City.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: nearly 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most poster heads emerged in Carolines, and were very successful until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown in size, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional channels, for example, presenting shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasticly lascif football of the FXX channel) and now has his own skate show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is more known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (the surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up actor, but he became a accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal storyteller of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the Hotel de Ville, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in comic DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a alley between two buildings and said well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and approaching $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that Chinese gourmet electricity manufacturing is strengthening.
The price of the US reference raw material for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to 96.24 dollars the barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during the electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving him with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on prices over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, showing an increase in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to increase after growth returned to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been experienced for two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent Gross, a reference for the international gross already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Challenges to the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored some restrictions on the right of voluntary abortion in Texas that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that State, largely calling into question the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The judgment given by the Court of Appeal means that doctors exercising IVGs must have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The admission privilege is the right of a physician, under his or her medical status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
The advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may lead to an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a judge of first instance felt that, on the eve of the law's entry into force, the provisions dealing with the admission privilege were anti-constitutional.
But Texas's Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is bridging the Governor's position, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first instance judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to power, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show at your appointment?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the percheer André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Passed the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored this first premium.
Like every year, the first audition shows burn a wide selection of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few of them found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind the television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday requiring changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and disbanded it from the file.
The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the appeal was brought by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city relied on its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a supervisor to assist the police department in changing its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case as it violated the judge's code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly addressed the Court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and men of Hispanic origin as part of their monitoring and search programme.
She appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are being carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police control.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many defenders of civil rights.
This system of control and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls, which were mainly related to black men and of Hispanic origin.
A court case was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Proponents advocating changes in the NYPD's control and search program say they will end unfair practices, will allow for more effective police forces and trust, and will change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money, and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been severely reduced in the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the cost of housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would deal with the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for Elysée chef
Entered in the 500 m2 of the Elysène kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the steps until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation locations, and fed an incalculable number of great people from this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a potato CAP.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!" said Bernard Vaussion, ironic, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents for whom he has been acquitting, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It's always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of Elysée!
It is a pity to Heads of State who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all gourmets," kindly denounced Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who returned the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people must be served in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of Elysée's kitchens, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, goes away with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said praise.
"The human side is here," he says.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who for his part has been in Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-house building, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire went forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that firefighters' rapid response has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are being built in a close-up manner.
The burned house had four dwellings, but no tenant was on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was very limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of the investigation, but the Sappers have removed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Loup: out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese let some pictures escape from his next film whose role, the role of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to defy you in his role as a busy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange broker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a large corruption case in Wall Street".
In the 1980s, then, Jordan Belfort mounted a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is following festivals, women, drugs.
Decedency and excesses of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
It looks like the movie's finally going to last 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate justly in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon pipe on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated in the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking Pawlby's voice box and "planting permanently in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr.Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say about it," said Edis.
He stated that NotW was using three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the supervision, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course I do."
Rumours about a connection involving Clarke was first taken over by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she was told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer involving Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's smallest facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow, of which I really would like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as David Blunkett's former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr.Blonkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The President of the United States was scheduled to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri Al Maliki, on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of US assistance to combat the greatest wave of violence in the past five years.
Iraq experienced the most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 persons died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 persons were injured.
The United Nations is even higher with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October has been highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of the American troops, the level of violence causes fear of a new embarrassment while neighbouring Syria is experiencing a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was imputed to the Islamic State in Iraq and to the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "World War" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the interviews in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had provided an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the Executive, and the Congress's elected representatives.
On Thursday, he advocated that the international community conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also called on Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uighour group of the attack on Tiananmen
China's head of internal security accused a group of Xinjiang Uighurs separatists on Friday of being behind the trapped car attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, fell on the crowd that was on the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression conducted in 1989, and fired its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing has been organized and premeditated," said Meng to the Hong Kong chain Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan," he added, his words being taken over by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighour origin and specified that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident hurt 42 people.
The Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united through marriage ties.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each National Conference of Bishops, with instructions to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported by the National Catholic Reporter on Thursday, an independent American Catholic newspaper.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in the appropriate way to search the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
Democratic Republic of the Congo: army attacks the last fief of rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were cut off from the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of northern Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," AFP told a resident of Jomba, who was connected by phone around 12:30, and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Forces Armed of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to this witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "ratissage operation".
There were very clear signs behind him of cracks fed with small arms.
De Bunagana, a political fief and the final strong spot of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "in a final phase", with the FARDC "enrounding the M23 residual positions to clear them".
Since Friday's resumption, clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but provides decisive intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, went towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, aided civilian soldiers loaded a multiple rocket launch mounted on a nine of the FARDC trucks, intended to take over another device that splintered the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, once again called on the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" on Wednesday evening in the face of being unarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing without results since December.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only the Ugandan mediation is left to organise the signing," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsurface is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where around 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to pull back," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on the back.
It seems that the shootings are getting closer to the populations.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical to the French is proved to be a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's opera rock, most of the attempts would be a bit ridiculous.
And the successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the given.
Today, these two scenes handle titles as successful tubes.
The first, this Christmas, resumes her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world-wide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Belle and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "amants of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are taking place in the midst of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for such hard-won success.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Friends of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year-old leap backwards on the pretext that you can use anything around when you have Matt Pokora in your head.
After that, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us revive Broadway's golden age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popular of Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of Araigned Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists as in Broadway singers, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The supply of talent is as significant as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
It's the same kids who like telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the affection of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are probably held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are highly expected when they arrive in a province's Zenith.
The mayonnaise went to Paris and was tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all the major French halls in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a phantom driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 pm on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The car of a conductor was hit by a phantom driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic up to 9:00 a.m. at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, has caused little traffic congestion as the accident took place up to the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deviated by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the Caribbean Pirates attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares a new assault
Children play on a carbonized armor that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing a new attack on Friday against the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in the eastern DRC.
The aim is to clear the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu's mission is not very strategic," said North Kivu Governor Julien Palukus to the AFP.
Mr. Palokus is planning to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Fief politique and last place of rebellion, this place is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since then, hundreds of irreducibles of the M23 have been cut off at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby village of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting very close to Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was "salm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the previous fighting and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three other people were injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have failed to record the loss of life.
NSA revelations increase company paranoia for state supervision
By the end of August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, at a low altitude.
On order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national information agency of Germany, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American vanguard, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation had given rise to an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence services, again stressed in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to "loom the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a denunciation, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. storage service providers in the cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that spilled the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I believe that it is understandable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States poses such a significant risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data flight, according to a survey published in July by the EC consulting firm.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Policy makers expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and that it should seek to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, President of the German Business Software Company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of the United States espionage agencies exposed to Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies that thought until now that China represented the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have renounced their plans to use a U.S. provider of cloud storage services after disclosure of the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, SAP's co-director, says, "Our clients are asking us today a question that they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It's been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of BASF's Chemical Producer Company.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in the event that this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long tortured the message that it is at least inappropriate to recover a free USB drive during a professional living room or leave a laptop with no surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, states that the collection of mobile phones prior to board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid during their travel abroad due to the risk of harm to smartphone integrity.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
" SMEs are often lacking in experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-rate guilty of committing acts of economic intelligence piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French Director of Internal Intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Parents of a youth in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a carpet of struggle in the gymnasium of his high school, think that their son was murdered, said family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a rug standing behind the gymnasium in his high school on January 11.
While the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, the 17-year-old boy's family contests these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it is indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it challenges everything logically, the laws of physics as well as the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered solely for the purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cardboard and they got him back into a mortuary bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important issues remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for opening an official investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson died from "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if there is evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge from southern Georgia ordered the authorities to return all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government is publishing, as the number of children of school age with food allergies has greatly increased.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise the awareness of children's food allergies among faculty and staff, and how to treat them in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something whips my tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on the tongue" or "I have pins on the tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How do you explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side is in public by calling the United States ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand bans the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius calls the United States ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is that of the magnitude of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the world columns a few weeks apart the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of NSA's listening to the Quai d'Orsay?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks takes the lead on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignant us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The introduction of technology tools of very powerful interception by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism for almost ten years.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described as essential on both sides.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in contrast - as has already been said quickly - Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, as the question of the total absence of pre-debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and ultimately the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk for the United States to see a deterioration in its image?
We've got a pretty good report, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit in their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, where diplomatic relations with the United States have tended.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reticent, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and thus to NSA's control.
The last element: the vast movement of revelations initiated by media from all over the world, which contributes to initiating a debate on the monitoring practices of intelligence services up until then virtually nonexistent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambigus sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed to them in a rigid manner at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to enter an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make precipitated decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, contusioned and faded.
It is estimated that one child out of 2,000 born each year is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexed, the intersexity being part of the 60 group of diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law " seems to be a good idea."
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science about how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young non-compliant boys now have camps specifically designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial allowing her to keep an "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersexed, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this essentially Catholic country signed a petition for the "theory of genres" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, an infant's mother also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The parent's role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about ten years ago, the medical community considered gender to be a bartender, which can be erased and re-designed.
But now many are calling into question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambigus sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered that gender is malleable.
He used the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it to identify it as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a bald circumcision to castrate him completely, also removing the testicles, and to raise him as a daughter.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some doctors "still repeat this model".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these gender change operations said "they're not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambigus sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce suffered an external organ and testicle surgical ablation and was raised like a girl.
She was given the opportunity to take female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was not going to happen, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified it.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented her body from producing enough testosterone to allow her sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he returned to a man, following a treatment with testosterone, and was removed from his breasts.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he is defending the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director General of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "calls for labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make rapid decisions and give their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specialized in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and who assists thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "responsability" to parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete androgen insensitive syndrome.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or mother-in-law services.
"The law leaves some flexibility to parents so that they don't have to make quick decisions," said Baratz.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time limit before registering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will continue until 2015, despite the strong tensions between the left and the right in the coalition in power as the Senate's vote approaches, in order to break Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left-wing centre leader says he has "closed intention" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, declares its resignation.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People's Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd his refusal to surrender to the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to drop the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Safety Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the fire exchange.
Firefighters on the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple wounded".
"The security forces are on site," the airport specified on its Twitter account, while the images of the televisions showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gunfire," said a spokesperson from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) to the AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed one person evacuated on a handheld, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that temins 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tanks shot killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
One source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel known as "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered to have dropped Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama considered, in great secrecy, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's much-awaited book of the 2012 campaign, " Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said Thursday night that the President's close associates had conducted "deep group work and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, in order to measure the effect of the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the poll.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been violently kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisors – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Dale led the task of replacing Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that Clinton on the presidential list "would not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the review as "concerned," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know if Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible remodelling.
Although Dale said that he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary General acknowledged that it was "possibly" that Obama knew.
Martin added that " Double Down" did not answer the question as to whether the political surveys had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first mediocre-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent bonding.
He had the idea after reading a study on the medics and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the licker it becomes the brighter.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said, "That's something incredible but we're only in the early stages of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the medic luminescence is worth four times as much as gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
But she's got a pretty good taste!
The company's experimental approach to Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual scents of ice cream such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It's intrinsically impossible because of the refractive ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died as he did tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and did the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians who were burning the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : Figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more scary.
In the last two years, I have not distributed one candy and I will certainly not do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the gallbladder when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
The disguise is expected to amount to $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are raging.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy food such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no problem staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't gloat.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen's firm.
This accounts for approximately 272 million kg of Hershey, Suuettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents approximately 9 billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet managed to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Torry Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a type you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head style."
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us The Big Citrus when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped lemon, it's like decorateing a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were very little.
Fortunately for us, the "tendence of the baby frog" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these potions and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, the Americans will spend approximately $106 million on lemons, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
There are probably 542 million lemons grown this year from Illinois, which are slowly whistling on the porch of your home.
If you're looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg lemon.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a "bad bank" with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, designed to ease its relations with London and accelerate its recovery.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of suspicious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the depreciation of additional doubtful receivables of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonal structure.
RBS also indicated that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interference in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point seater and harness straps, as well as an intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Chief Executive Officer of Bowler Motorsport said, "The rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of the raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the vehicle of the Defender Challenge – the championship will really be palpative."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after remaining stuck 15 m above ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, a pregnant cocker, escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
She was found three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career
The firemen came down in recall along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover him safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable wing of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9 month pregnant cocker, escaped after an accident on the road Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, aged 25, and her 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire's Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately sought their lost dog and made a call to social media sites after she disappeared in career due to an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, a person in the sharp view who was walking his dog found Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck at 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire barracks ran to the site and came down to save Ruby by using an animal cage to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
I can't believe someone noticed the dog.
Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby had a lot of chance to get out of it free."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified watching the aid."
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was surprising having him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had passed out, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid that she would fall but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he's never been a Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio program this week, the pop star said she was a choreographer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He drooped at me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "did not categorically make advances to Katy Perry".
The representative added, "Perhaps she's confusing it with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backstop support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security agency boss on a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) Political Bureau, spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a special organization after the Monday bombing.
According to Chinese police, three Uighours from the same family in Xinjiang's Muslim dominant region, bordering several Central Asian countries, have precipitated their petrol canisters against the entry of the prohibited city in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 people.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who declared that he was fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The flash of Europe gives the Scots the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And here's the story of passport control stories at Berwick and of a border of barbed wires along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and that was to be anticipated).
Neither did anyone say that the EU Member States spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scottishs.
So it's a story that's not a story.
And a story so ancient that it is now fictional: I first heard the bobard say that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty story.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke for Brussels, especially now?
The following is the real news for Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the crisis of the euro, the Europe Project has officially died.
Across Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or who are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and coming from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberals-Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, together with the carcanon weighing on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis does not have much to do with national governments that report excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has weighed on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters – what German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer expense – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a restraining disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the deep revolt, particularly in France, is one of the leading leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy ill-advanced.
The result: the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – an opportune warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot rely on the principle that a division of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-money and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and single currency feeling in Europe will unite and ultimately kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to the free Europe of the Nations (Suverans) preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will return their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Great Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could agree to a more freer European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and it is worth noting – the anti-authenticity political movement that has best succeeded in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the chancellor of the Labour Echiquier, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/liberal-Democratic coalition.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty ages earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity could trigger early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be worried if the pubic breasts and hairs of her daughter begin to grow at 7-8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a paedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassurance of the parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid change towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, the hair under the arms and in the pubic area and the body odours, appear earlier among girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and one-half, while it was three-quarters in 1970.
"When the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Copying with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – this is something a paediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments exist to delay the onset of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size to adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "the control of puberty can mitigate certain behavioral problems and the sensation for girls to be different from others".
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose first rule was 10 years old.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from the scared and upset school to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged between 6 and 9 years, which linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
At the global level, mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and infants.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," explained Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the people of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that was just starting to resonate there, before Bob Dylan's arrival.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had raised the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their detour on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a musician and folk singer accomplished, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious celebration.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich adventures of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less resounding clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the juron poured to the machine gun when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells in a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't get through and get angry with the whole earth.
It accepts back-to-back replacements raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A Documentary Air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this district of New York called to become "the epicentre of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as reported by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes allures of documentary, 33T invenged dusty music label inhabited by an unpayable old secretary, with musical choices at the studios of the time and with the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character that crosses the film constantly: a beautiful red cat with a crackling gaze, companion of Llewyn Davis' fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "enlarged in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first lessons in music were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "accident can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be stuck by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He'll never know the word "retirement."
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died Thursday to 83 years, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of spy novels who knew too much about it".
He had spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, assured the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million countries", he advanced last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building of the Foch Avenue just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or the ivory reported from the 130 surveying countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a cigarette pack, the reader is entitled to the traditional coverage with the photo of a young woman at the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his old serenism (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat distraught and CIA contract agent to pay for the family castle's repairs, launched himself into the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people from whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, Albert London, who went to the scene and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical leaf."
"I am constantly on my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet with journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premeditated: one month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Road".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anuar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy," one year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he related the columns of 4X4 jihadists that were based on the Malian capital.
I'm not in the mood, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for one month behind his machine to write IBM to marguerite dating from 1976 "all the pieces of which have been changed".
300 pages later he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Gérard de Villiers regularly pushed for machoism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, and in two sentences Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not of age".
He won't die and won't retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft are arguing about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute is raging between the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-haul flights, opening the way to an bitter confrontation during the aeronautical show in Dubai which takes place this month.
The conflict is about the width of seats proposed on long-haul flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most courteous by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping, eventually, a record of orders at the event, which will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its "777X" will be upgraded to accommodate 406 people in more than 17 inches wide economic class, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class to 18 inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange hits on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls the public directly before the Dubai Aeronautics show, where the 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We could recently see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turbo-powered aircraft," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the turn of the century, the American average weight increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American size tower of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival attached itself to a concept of a seat dating back to the 1950s, when the vicinity of the freshly baptized jet set was narrower.
Airbus added that it ordered a study that indicated that an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to seat width and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that the experience in cabin is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
"It's really about giving flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their performance.
Behind the dispute is an aircraft order race for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at market prices in the coming decades, sufficient to keep the US and European export balance.
As Reuters pointed out for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-haul bimotor models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to make more seats and more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers express themselves in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
Aircraft vendors who go around the world even take a meter to check competing configurations with them.
While offering comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Up until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern appliances, the experts say that it is unlikely that his call for the aeronautical industry to set up a size standard for seats will result, but that he might forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just out of the victory of his boat at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the software group's capital that it co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negative on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for fiscal year 2013 closed in May due to the Group's poor performance, which failed to achieve its growth goals, but received approximately $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
For the year as a whole, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% in 2013, while the Stock Exchange price rose by 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice alive from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before starting the human test, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but finding that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to develop anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track and neutralize all nicotine molecules in the blood system before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having its nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were calm," said researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and not practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms the liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
The head of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, was learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the northern Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shooting," said a senior security officer.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on the move to London, informed the British Government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi never to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the government's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of the state to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where Obeid owns two restaurants and a café, after their expiry in August 2005, without any tender.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions begun in 2005, the government put pressure on the leases to be offered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's companies, which accounted for approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported calls for tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who admitted that Mr. Tripodi was demanding a change in government's lease policy.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports department after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, declared responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The manager did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian SA-125 manufacturing missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missiles shipments to Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test.
The government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diverted means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today when Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australian neighbours.
"The frightful statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return to the time when trade unions were calling for a protected labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the White people should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, others being under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the job offer is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the company sponsoring it".
Companies may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died from a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The affluent man's son, aged nine, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Baron Transport, Kramer, said that the project "will bring the United Kingdom together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown said "excited" the idea of working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling time between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to have a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown stated: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to consider options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite the United States' efforts to ease the regulatory burden on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision requiring American carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of aircraft electronic devices," she said.
The issue is regulated that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the continued maintenance of safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that she was complying with the current rules at the moment.
"In line with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that might benefit passengers, and we will carefully review the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision varies from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light electronic portable devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will request passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small municipality of Pia has experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about 30 people according to the testimony gathered...
On Halloween Day, the evening was agitated on the Pia side where a rix involving several people broke out on the Post side.
At least four minor injuries would be regrettable.
Alerts, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s guaranteed lenders benefit from the medium classes of tightening the belt
Janani Amirthalinga has a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her girls' tuition fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone in," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is similar in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third guaranteed loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Making a guarantee of jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's guaranteed lenders received an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same trading centre.
However, guaranteed lenders have the advantage of not applying for credit or salary verification, and may release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to lenders on bail while families are under pressure to increase the cost of living and overindebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and low-market credit driven by a too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families are turning to bail-out lenders to close the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing household debt, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is ranked as having 80 per cent of GDP, while the figure was 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently come out of a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with cost increases, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to complement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, a Malaysian bank economist at CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people eager to put their personal assets in place to reach the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the assets guaranteed in the 200 retail mortgage shops in the city are in gold.
People say, "the price of gold is high, let's put the chain in grandmother's gold and we'll go back to search for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest gambling loan shop operator, has recorded an increase of 20% in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is in the loan-to-gage sector that ValueMax, the operator of the store in Bendemeer and of 15 other shops such as Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its director general.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week when it launched the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have supported criticism of the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms.Yes indicates that betting not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property that they already own, and the monetizing of their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Guaranteeing is becoming more socially acceptable as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
Neither are those who go to the lenders on bail only those who have financial problems.
Prosperous people from Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage loan shops to put gold lingots or Rolex watches on a bet, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to make a hard move," says Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was acting, was deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicated that Mr.Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with people under 18 years of age and do not access the Internet.
He will appear in a provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went to the supermarket in a Nazi uniform, before being chased.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred with a armrest with the Gammous cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the shop Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time she arrived, he had already left without a sign," she added.
I was tailing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were fucking mouths.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to draw attention," testified one client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, at Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to disguise yourself as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining "mental problems."
A $325 million rescue plan for the Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the blazing health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste the money.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "urgent measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided upon after consultations with the independent Member of Parliament of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our view, will address the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgery.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-rendezvous clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better outpatient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmania government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system".
He nevertheless congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that he had made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will help greatly to remove Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional, non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a fortune solution."
"The reason we're here is that the government's labour government removed $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretends it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is worth a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In the 1760s, moving to France, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she confronts the limitless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother and becomes an erotic object of fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, reports the monitoring body
Syria destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with one day's advance on the deadline of
November 1 set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or make "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic.
The announcement was made that the fighting was raging in the city of Safira on Thursday, which, according to experts, is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The militant group, which is following the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067, including 6,365 children, are estimated to be civilians.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, 18,678 of whom were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah activists.
Of the dead, there are also estimated to be 2,202 deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not provide any details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors as they had to complete their mission, which was to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within a tight time frame.
An OPCW statement, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now satisfied with monitoring – and being destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling”.
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned at this time".
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, indicated the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and...the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war is primarily opposed by the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 responded with anger to the sentence of the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution peloton.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing by being one of the most sought-after men in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the attacks targeting two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a sentence of life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, known as Demolition Man, for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corten, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions committed by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution platoon," said Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without other grandchildren or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor parked van, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell asleep in the coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Going to jail for 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was deeply mocked by the grief that he had been able to cause to others.
The verdict was given on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Air carriers will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented varies from airline to airline," said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA indicated in a statement.
At present, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to ring them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not turn them off until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground-rolling, said the FAA.
Most new line and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenants, said she was happy with these changes.
"After the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for this – it will be beneficial for everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS messages, or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble style game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was ejected at great noise from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops must always be stored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power regarding mobile phones is the responsibility of the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered risky.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the CCF, that they could disrupt mobile phone relays if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Destractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of those days.
New line aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand the electronic interference that is approved by the FAA.
The airlines allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Amended aircraft to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are under pressure to relax restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders charged a Kindle e-book reader aircraft and flew it to see if there were any problems, but none of them.
This has inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee mixed feelings as to whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he thought interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft may interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for sensible arrangements for travellers with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitrous bird from a North Sea platform was released into nature
A bird, helitourized after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water wheel was mounted on board a helicopter heading towards Aberdeen last month before it was launched by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa Rescue Centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water channel was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added, "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water roll was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting involved in the long and hard process of reforming the European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that controlling these key competencies should return to the hands of Westminster.
The single market has led to general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the company's world is insisting on a "significant change" that restores power in the United Kingdom.
The challenges are high – achieving a change in the Treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow for a 16% turnaround of votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a single moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK's hands.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses, this means once again putting emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween colours
In the United States, President Obama did not depart from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed candy to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of hurricane Sandy.

Alexei Miller from Gazprom states that the Bulgarian pipeline is opening a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects," said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wishes to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, which includes information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2 if there are three other small nearby islands.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode in the history of the English Navy, which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
Some tens of people, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutinees, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of the generosity of London.
The Council of the Island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed.
France already has to carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, northeastern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of bribery, reports the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or gifts in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intrusible with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mushes" - the subordinate civil servants - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them former executives of the giant petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP head in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest positions in the state.
But the government has in no way demonstrated the intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were accused of sexual assaults on children as a result of allegations made against the Caringbah educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its statement of openness before the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education supervisor was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by stressing "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments of four institutions during an audit of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that the employees knew they had to report any violations of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, sat them on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord Caringbah's leadership and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that she was responsible for YMCA Caringbah's childhood services, Jacqui Barnat, who would lead Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these violations to their superiors.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they maintained with Lord have blurred their judgment, which means that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the YMCA Council of New South Wales that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements was made by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley, shortly after the allegations were referred to.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence, but that it was a "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruiting, controlling, initiating, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to Prime Minister, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his mandate, the 59-year-old reported his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have responded, according to the Evening Standard in London: "Yes, of course, but it could probably happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations met in Cardiff to fight and win the trophy of the Year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after having made his first guns, the little one and his Shetland Toffee have trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style of the annual competition at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against elegant melon hats, men and women, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of uncommon training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training since with his Shetland poney every day.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo."
They presented themselves to and against all, but both caught the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were so happy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He went through the whole length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
In the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the event of the Horse of the Year – and I am sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said, "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his poney."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his pretty clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be redesigned"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redrafted, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete reshaping," the regulator said.
The order of "remodelling" comes from the Guangdon administration for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that New Express, a member of the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles about Zoomlion, which was listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete redesign of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately redesign the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued his apology on the first page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made TV confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carriers in "inaccessibility"
At Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the road.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "no danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", the "time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a defence ship specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the failed heater.
"All is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013", explains DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
It should be recalled that Charles-de-Gaulle's aircraft carriers come out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had set up Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small avarie", circumscribed to the space of containment of the reactor, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I've been able to see a lot of dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, costs of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to no longer end.
In short, siphoning without limit of our pockets.
Millions of dilapid dollars could be saved to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money removed from taxpayers will reduce their freedom of consumption and contribute to their loss.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuous expenditure and maintenance of the bad ducks: cultural centre deficit, strong subsidy to the Cité de l'Energie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that never came.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not at the public levels to invest in such companies, but at the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes at the Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large population decline, water use has declined considerably throughout the country.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never miss out on water and severe regulations as to its use could be greatly softened.
In summary, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without making a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don't think a sheep breeder makes worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagating on a length equivalent to nearly six long football courts, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with undefined warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by going unnoticed, said the authorities.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered as a result of marijuana harvesting in central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels that need to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks leaving the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and going up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadori Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "admission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, requesting her to introduce herself to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible channels under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal it filed against its extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found shelter at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard issued "a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man requesting him to appear at a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
It continues to breach the conditions of its release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the granting of the opinion by the police.
Assange is afraid to be evacuated from Sweden to the United States where he might be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Ends the passwords to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho , estimates that even "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in such a transversal and transnational universe as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone in the world will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, Consumer Privacy Officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology, Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in one, and pessimism, in the other?
Biometry will be based on new technologies that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data is the fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people working on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand involve a voluntary and specific act of the people.
It is both a safety - we cannot capture this data to their ignorance - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as face or iris recognition (colored part of the eye).
These techniques become operational thanks to increased sensor accuracy and the computing capacity of computers required for data analysis.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, Director of Access R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
"Today we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police a suitcase costing 90.000 euros to analyse DNA samples in the place of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the person it claims to be).
The identification has so far been about the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photographs, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State already has on all its citizens.
This helps to ensure that one person does not try to usurp the identity of another person.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We collect the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to the photographs of celebrities that freely circulate on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a quidam that makes the tail in a store, follow its progression through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening of a computer).
More recently, the presence check was added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also apply to transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric drive: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the natural security company in partnership with banks and brands of the large distribution: when paying in stores with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger in a reader who scans the veins.
Experimentation is planned to last for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in cash for thirty seconds less, it is significant," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if one tries to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, in the absence of extensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to worry.
"The advances in facial recognition, the increase in surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was charged with a fine of £1,000.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for rolling at 210 km/h with a hot drink in equilibrium between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the care and attention required.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence resulted in a 6 month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay expenses of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, registered a 7% stamp fee for properties that cost more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties within a corporation rather than individually.
The stamp right already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and amounts to £708 million over the 2012/13 fiscal year, exceeding the total amount of the combined Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Humber regions.
Cook said: "As the stamp duty on high-value property increases and the introduction of anti-avoidance law increases, it is very difficult to say that high-value property is under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous south-west London sector that is located from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show a steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a growing "internal market", the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved more their tail to the right (from the dog's perspective), while nervous dogs moved more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that just as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals looking at movies that included other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
Surely it won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films that included other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to date the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw a dog without expressing their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view, the tail) they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the dog's perspective, turning the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet several other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail towards one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, stated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs were easier to go to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could arise from the fact that dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider animals from films or dogs as robots.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tails move on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys is relegating a concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with its singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to perform in the The Hydro concert hall in downtown on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys also have to postpone the show to Glasgow's Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – that is, a group of 120 "Cerdinary Electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops will be exalted to the dignity of the cardinal, known as the Consistory.
" Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals will probably decrease.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis' election in March of this year," said Valero.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope ruled by himself.
"Now, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that François asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities in the rank of cardinal, but that François was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he will name".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat folder
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with tiltable files manually, according to a statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could show a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is impacted from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injuries," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
NHTSA was not able to review the information letter to owners due to the 16-day closure of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% over the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share price increased by 1.4% to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday morning, in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on foundations has been going on in this area for some time.
A mitoyan foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim arrived at the site to recover his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke," said Sylvain Jean, who stays close to the site.
I landed, and I went to take off the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the 50s who worked for a carpentry company.
Reanimation manoeuvres were attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of despair of an elector of Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made laudable efforts defied by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd-year medical student at Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a terrible book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memories of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records in the evening and sleep, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could blow your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and newsagents took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries moved to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period prior to taking office in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, it is like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "unseen and unknown" and the assassination of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the administration of Obama against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, nor the accusation of the reporters that reveal the government's ills.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Act on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have identified above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had been talking about for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has fallen below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me desire the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses to Clinton's benefit for the Pennsylvania Primarys.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get on the right track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr President, and I am no longer in agreement with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, at around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on Retinne Street in Fleron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of the aid, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about parental leave.
Billionaire Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which challenges the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued that this argument was an attempt to remove any possible conflict issues.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won Sunshine Coast's seat in Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of reshaping the voting system to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott's girls, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is complete?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree?
Today, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, stated that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take up his new duties "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a public service issue.
"We're not looking for a reward, except for history's reward because we have to serve the community at a critical moment," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for Conservation and Study of Animals and Environment Marines (OCEAMM), is responsible for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
While in the past the species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
Moreover, it is not impossible for such advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species of a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
Similarly, two species very close morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific humpback dolphins and the Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is it an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had long been known by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at this location.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral or accidental capture epidemic occurs in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e., the stock, and the potential for recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, of which the population of the new species of discovery has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brew limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known medium.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on life research on other planets than marine research, and it's high time it changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global investigation of foreign exchange market manipulation suspicions is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$ 5.3 trillion change hand every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation which echoes the scandal of the interbank handling of the Libor rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed that it received requests for information from regulators this month.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and the other regulators," said one bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, close sources of the file reported that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages files sent to and from a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his post as European trading officer for the foreign exchange of JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European currency exchange manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, the senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders was charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had filed an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said he was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations of bankers that would have agreed to handle exchange rate manipulation.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicating sources close to the file.
Banks tap the instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but which has been called into question this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limit opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the business by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market for highly liquid foreign exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal exchange platforms "causes the possibility of starting to have an impact on the market at low cost".
The news arrived the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had returned a trader working in its fund office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank informed the competent authorities promptly and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was barred, supported a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby maintained that he never saw an investigation "so bad".
Mr. Ruby told the Canadian press that the police had "noted or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extorting the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Mr Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that the chief of police Bill Blair chose knowingly not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and searched - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "excellent and desperate" to be argued to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" for the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges down to the middle of the year, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are moving down halfway on Friday, lead by some new disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious as they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could detract from its quantitative flexibility policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street is predicting an opening of American actions on the rise, after two consecutive relapsing sessions.
At values, Renault (-4,63%) recorded the strongest decline of CAC 40, led by the warning based on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing results this morning and announcing the creation in-house of a "bad bank" with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) continues to lead the EuroFirst300 ups in response to a press release that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going well, as is evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro is continuing to retreat against the US currency and has reached $1.3517 at a lower level of two weeks.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Major victory for Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's ratified Health System Reform Act was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of losing all federal funding of the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in lice during the 2012 primary elections, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant Honor to Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute on Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli border crossing
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday, October 31, 2013, in the evening during a violent attack on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1st, after an depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another head of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials from the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug up by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres inside the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a press release, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupying in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesman.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the Tshahal forces (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the Peter Lerner army.
On Thursday, 31 October, Israel struck an air base in north-west Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement, reported the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide any details on the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he just added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Referring to the "exclusive sources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing aimed at a cargo of ground-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies to Danse Danse: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to ticks and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advance, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a thread of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, completely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playground, hurry when the next photograph appears, incarnate, emerges in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group at the Unisson (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where everyone performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rate is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prier will take refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, part of the poem by Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This energetic and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up suffocating and numbing.
As also does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hair that suffocate or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, has imposed itself, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like forms of form, open up a broader, gibo-like imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touched the magic.
The public liked it, the reception was warm.
Gymnopedia, after the surgery, is richer.
The scene is partly grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers came to play the scores.
Their touching music ill-addresses give true fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with the red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Love is carnating, fleeing or playing.
The gesture, the laughter and the little screams beautifully translate the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coital beings.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
Here everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superimpose, the dancers cabotin, descend among the spectators, glosses, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a savamly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has begun an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he has capped on the pole when selling patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Assembly in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to Internet search terms, have indicated the outcome of the trial, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market in part based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although he failed in his attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," said the conclusion of the trial.
Rockstar claims greater damages and interests against Google, as he claims that Google's patent infringement is obstructed, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater that causes the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette in a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert dispatched by the public prosecutor's office ensures that the cause of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leakage and accumulation of gas.
The vital prognosis of both victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long packed on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, her helicopter, her ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Well and except, he was able to join the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were re-hosted by the President of the CPAS.
Andrene and Namur firefighters and Arches police intervened.
Crisise's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected President to give an oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of investment, but it is unlikely that his triumph day will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he gave the oath of investment to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was defeated 16 months earlier.
When he invested in the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He sworn before the 18 black-dressed judges of the Court whose building on the outskirts of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to a better day, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that has been considered for over 84 years since his formation as an illegal and harshly oppressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to cheer the new President and, apart from the fast presidential of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
His personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red tie suit, addressing the judges present in the woodwork hall where he has sworn.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited Cairo University where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he put himself in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which went the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former disembarked president, had deposed him.
But by accepting to take formal oaths before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the U.S. has slowed the car market up
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main ones having achieved performance below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers show double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million sales at annual rates and adjusted for seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million based on estimates by Adam Jonas, analyst Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he estimates that this slight brake is primarily explained by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first 15 months of the month".
GM, however, reported an increase of almost 16% in sales to 226 402 vehicles last month, compared with 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of his pick-ups, saw his sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below consensus, despite one year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM's action won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault leaded to the stock market by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses the largest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had declined by almost 20% of its annual net profit forecast, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshaping of his leadership.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is Nissan's clear profit warning," said one person in charge of trading a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to the Nissan website.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party location
Two people were killed and one was seriously injured on Friday evening by shots fired by two persons on board a motorcycle passing in front of a local of the neo-Nazi party, Aube girded in the western suburbs of Athens, has been learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Aube had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, depending on the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorism department deployed on the central avenue of the outskirts of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the conviction of six golden Aube MPs, including the party leader and founder, to participate in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against that party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club's champions against Ajax and AC Milan.
Deported against the Barça for a blow to Neymar, the Scottish media saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to the violent winds that hit many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected areas are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in black, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal region also has its lot of failures with nearly 7,000 private power stations in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and hopes record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force, in particular with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are well on track to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before interest and tax deduction," he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector returned during the second half of the year, which made it possible to offset a small drop in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year, where seasonal demand is lower and was expected to profit over the entire fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shoots at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown encapsulates opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without sacrificing, as a result of an apparent dispute with dismissed employees.
The assailants fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, General of Police Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives a tourist since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and represses the demonstrations of its supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature classes, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining literature and English language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate English literature qualification.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs – the raw materials to be radically revised tomorrow.
It will make changes to other basic subjects next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Regulatory Board of Examinations, will reveal a reshaping of the structure of the CSCs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," insisting that CSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students have about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours on maths, close to the coalition government sources have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance given to materials in the international classifications – would likely encourage schools to attend more hours.
The program will place greater emphasis on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that State, which largely questions the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
An octogenaire welcomes children with a Muy rifle for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door for candy on Halloween evenings.
One of the shorelines of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door by holding its hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a joint pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of German Resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
"Its body was buried in a common pit of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured daily with great drawing on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigms of the Post-War.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando," said Tuchel.
He was wearing a uniform of general.
"In the left pocket were his service states with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, declared himself shocked by this revelation.
If one of the most brutal Nazi sadics is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous taste of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is being enraged," he insurgented in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final resolution" and, in particular, under his orders Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend watching hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him as the "CNN Heroes of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could receive any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father's death in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ' s health expenditure is realized in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 surgical operations free of charge in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé's central hospital.
And it has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they get caught in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and crossing hard terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Happiness does not always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr.Bwelle – with his great smile and abundant energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people every time we visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beech, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of the Sunday morning.
It is an escalating rhythm, but the musicians of the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to the city, tired but proud of the work it did.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge in the last year, and it knows that their presence can make the most of the difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that his free operation to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to making this mobile hospital live and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr.Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr.Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We've been able to participate in operations to help suck blood or pass the instruments on to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
It is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not near to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily while keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexes, academics have long plagued the definition and location of Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but by highlighting its weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitration of works by others in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but ignoring the publisher's hidden work and underground writing.
Do you have any heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly yet, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakening, animator, and federator of their work, but pointing out that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
In this uncertain image the monument of the "Remembrance Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a gigantic chip market presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp look at it and the elucidation, but unwaveringly diletting.
The two books published by Nora next two years have already established that the one who passed to avoid writing had a lot and well written.
The book herein should give it final justice.
However, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation to jump as on foot from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brocant back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why do these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is a matter of time concern.
In short, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the pernicious spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliging, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is tracking.
He does not inherit eternal frankness, he refuses the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by annoying questions.
Of which the company, born of the company itself: why, in such a long-term country within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masqueraded, are these dramatic calls to unity heard?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjugate the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundys, Catholics and Protestants: the divisional forces, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that finds national history in two.
Starting with the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not to deny it; on the contrary, mindful of finding it sacrificial and all the more avid unity and indivisibility that she had cut her head off from the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that the American escapade of Pierre Nora could be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to form a new society.
But American cousinship only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There were men who had left their former regime in England and had no more concern about it.
Here, the men of an ancient native regime, and all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here she sows the drama and confiscates it.
There are always honorable founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors, whose models are difficult to make, and who have died together.
There is an institutional consistency, and here is a case of constitutions, such as mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
The France that goes away, the France that comes
However, there was a time when the French thought they could cover up the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
In this Central and Creative Third Republic, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was obscurely preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
This is again under discussion, driven by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of claimed minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, in prime, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We find out that the track is a Castanian.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The rudder of lichens was in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Certainly in a less steep, steeper and more subtle form.
But don't be fooled by it, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
On March 8, 1986, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was removed from Beirut with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" coming to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, and was released nearly 21 months later on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the Hosts' Defense Association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge a complaint and bring hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Detained over 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
On the night of your release, you were on the 8 p.m. plateau of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In place, for example, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're laying us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to France's embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrive there as a helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did you get on French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible bump.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back, and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the plane stairs, the rendezvous with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers shoot themselves to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do some police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well positioned to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the toughest thing.
In the evening, I'm at 8:00 p.m., the next day, I'm on TV too.
Then start a kind of recovery to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How did medical examinations and debriefing happen?
I had a right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, exams of all genres and encounter with a psychiatrist.
It is not a sitting that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I'm listening to what's going on.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things get worse, others less.
I'm trying to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my president's helmet of the "Otages of the World" association, which allows me to distance myself from it, and I think it's much more interesting to approach.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, together with others, for recognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to describe the "political" hostage-taking - most of the time this is the case - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, complain and take hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why not say to hostages "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, that it is founded, legitimate, that it has a common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
Mobilising all over Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brother activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a mess.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial instigated by a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to have Sisi judged, not the contrary.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, and 60 demonstrators were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed at the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it," the Minister in New York reminded the Anti-Defamation League of the fight against anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he ordered General Frank Grass, head of the National Guard, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The frown of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texane National Guard's settlements, as a result of a conflict between the Texane Act and the Federal Marriage Act.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Western Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday 2 November at skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the scheduled final at 3 p.m. and the award of prizes at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodige hyerois Lorenzo Palumbo.
In just 10 years, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing until he gets back to competitors who over three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto is hunting journalists who have come to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of being drugged, according to several media.
A video of justice seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having eaten cracks, while at the same time recognizing having a inclination for cannabis.
On Thursday, he hunted down several journalists from his property to question him.
We also believe that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31 that a case of rage had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The caton was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The rage diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of those who could have contacted this cat from October 8 to October 28,," says the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before symptoms occur, is very effective," the communiqué states.
The ministries are now calling on persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or on a skin injured by this caton or whose animal would have been in contact with this caton between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free from rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free of charge," according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the latest case of "Aboriginal" rage was recorded in December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rage on an illegally imported dog from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a fatal disease if it is not treated in a timely manner," the ministries recalled and was transmitted for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama is lagging behind on its reform of the health system
Under a guise of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his promise unambiguously and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health system, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President over the last few days for deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a shock in the news" about the terminations, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even less expensive than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who enter into insurance themselves were forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Available Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms.Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "laughfully".
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this sentence, as she believed her micro-cut, addressing a sitting assistant behind her at the assembly meeting yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join the Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has constantly asked Ms.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign up to a regime through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasted to millions of Americans.
Vettel separates a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky one, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat into the runway.
German Sebastian Vettel, quadruple world champion of Formula 1, separated a special helmet for the free tests of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, the drawing of which was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, in a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stables.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and therefore can see close to the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive global title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party from the suburbs
Above all, don't let us down.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the national great family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday at the press conference in its native municipality of Aubervilliers, from being born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the whole neighbourhood.
My proposal 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, a territorial attaché, claims today as "apolitical 100%" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militating alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he goes on.
There's only to the extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme, which can be consulted on the Internet, from many topics that are supposed to be addressed to the suburbs, especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, the 16-year-old civilian majority, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
Still to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this could be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburbs party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that he already has seven top lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mails I've received since yesterday don't all come from suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that American espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry pointed out that the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs had been weakened by admitting that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been directed on "automatic pilot" when a series of fire-fighting revelations by declarant Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government in the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and clarify to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused as part of this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that NSA was a good force and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try and kill people, detonate them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had raised regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations due to the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency's supervision is causing.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and chairman of the Sub-Commission on European Affairs of the American Senate, during an interview since Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some of the US allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations reported on documents disclosed by Snowden that NSA had intercepted data and communications from the cell phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and from 34 other heads of state.
The intelligence director, James Clapper, justified ally espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a tour of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed within the next few days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "a affectionate firmness".
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been implementing themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to be spying on," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the ransom generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results, and the day after an announcement by the Fed of its continued support to the economy, as planned.
An Australian calls on her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked him early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian League player rugby Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"Of course, we have lived a moment of anxiety, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released following the payment of a 50 000 Baht security.
In Australia, the press stated that she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer at Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to renew its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will stop the supporters of Anderlecht coming other than with the cars of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the police zone Brussels-midday, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to go to this meeting of the League of Champions will have to use the travel system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesperson transmitted.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures had been taken to make arrests and even police guards," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff, to reflect on how to better integrate students who live on horseback between several cultures.
The school board has just revealed its vision of "living together in French".
Vision diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all origins to discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're natives or come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"Well, we're creating projects so that they can identify themselves with all this," explains Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne from the New World Institute has identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations we live in, within the student customer," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, in some cases, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"There are different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: language, school, social and cultural.
