Inflation in Europe has fallen on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, following an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the Statistical Office of the European Community located in Luxembourg indicated.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Contrary to US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, along with the growth in commodity prices and the fall in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, the ECB's Catch 22 is: "dissuade" inflation in order to avoid having to intervene later on.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent has been a record over the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has gone off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Quotas for the cereal market have increased by 88 per cent and the soy price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
Food oil and dairy prices also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil increased by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will increase from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the rate of inflation over 12 months is around 3 per cent, however, for the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) supporters increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Survey) has never seen such low socialist support, that is 13 per cent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent more than two thirds (71 per cent) of support for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party) due to the greater determination of the opposition voters.
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two per cent throughout the population.
On some faithful voters to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, reaching 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent additional, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of spring and last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is forecast to increase and only one tenth are forecast to improve the situation.
In December of this year, 71 per cent of the respondents, i.e. a majority never seen in Gallup's previous surveys, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change in government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, the current rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of respondents said that they would certainly go to vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election next Sunday", only 55 per cent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent of respondents would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospitalization fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospitalization fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, unlike this year's VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (daily economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Cart also increased by 16 per cent on average, an increase in value of significantly more than a thousand forints appeared in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown" in the major food stores last December, did not increase sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are of course shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Carteier in hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by 91 forints at least.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost unchanged last year, however, prices of turkey, walnut and parrot increased sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from KSH (Institut Central des Statistiques) but, at Auchan, one kilo of bread was found in 139 forints only.
Competition has not reduced the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre registered bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the registered bottle including.
It prevents this year, in terms of Daily Cart, Auchan was the cheapest and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its Daily Shopping Cart by 15 per cent while Tesco and Auchan have increased it by about 18 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket last year and the cheapest basket this year, we find a difference of 12 per cent while the difference between the cheapest basket last year and the cheapest basket this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while at the same time knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexed, the hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader is ill-calculated for the rotation of a product, he may lose a big profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the rise in daily basket prices has changed so excessively that the most expensive basket was more than 1,720 forints than in 2006, whereas the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not too excessive since the most expensive basket value was more than 1,630 forints than last year's, and the least expensive prices also increased by 1,284 forints.
Close to the two Christmas seasons, we observed a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some basic supplies, the Institute of Statistics observed an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily Cartier of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the brutal price increase accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
Based on our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term food from pallets.
Wednesday morning important tails formed the caisses of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain about the survey companies not even reaching the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals do the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overrun of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also do the economy on disinfectants
A MRSA infection has not long been diagnosed at the János Hospital trauma department.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected in a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred at the same site.
The injured person from a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after he had to return because of an MRSA infection, and since then the doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angina, amygdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used overly or inappropriately, the bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacteria that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged immune system malfunction, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on elderly, small-weight or impaired organisms.
According to the János hospital director, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
Above all, the infection should not be confused with the epidemic, it is not possible to find MRSA only the one or the other one, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for treating them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they carry MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in the mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not conducive to preventing the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases arise only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician at the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and infections.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care," said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals do the economy on disinfectants
There is scientific evidence that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, put gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in the event of an epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Governmental Project against MRSAs
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant spending on social security funds, which is why we are fighting against this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not drunk
The official finding on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd district was made.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd district, who had resigned from his post since then, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to drunkness or dizziness, announced Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former Commissioner did not consume alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd district police crashed a 55-year-old man who was faced with him when he turned, with his personal car, on the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(By the way, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car which starts a turn must leave the pedestrians.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and applied for his retirement because, according to the police communication, the accident has greatly affected him.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office in charge of the Budapest investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
€400 million extra for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three €400 million credit line agreements in Budapest on Friday to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit contract worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the appropriation of EUR 150 million also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, while the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary completed the details of metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe has been directed towards this Balkan country, which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become the cheapest?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
At present, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Sables d'Or", the "Côte du sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more of them are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, business and office areas promise the highest rate of depreciation.
Bulgaria is on the way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf paradise, making it a priority destination after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors already buy many, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, according to Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old detached houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria is ranked among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who are looking forward to achieving medium- or long-term added value.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising as demand increases.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the professional meetings end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, intense discussions are being held on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss exact figures, but were prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed to providing financial and technological assistance to those countries in need, excluding emission reductions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund set out in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of 16 members, probably within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the “After 2012 Agreement”, and was prepared to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to take appropriate commitments to meet their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members at that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-87 level, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments below the Kyoto Protocol's values would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was stressed in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the UN Nobel Peace Prize to deal with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in average earth temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units, on the video-sharing site, provide recordings of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
Firstly, the British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan have been loading video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, and the BBC has announced this.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londrès or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered under the name of Defenceheadquarters in the spring of 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were put on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the public aware of the real objectives of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing in relation to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the soundness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is upset because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site, which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocriteed, the officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already gone over the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently taken care of loading these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently using the America's Army shooting game downloadable for free. In this game the player can place himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas rots and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a late-year meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry organizes a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is divided.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the department's employees who will be invited to do so.
At Christmas, Orphelins, children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end of year atmosphere.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
GKM's holiday will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a mess.
The NFÜ's Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing the bids.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to join the manager.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening was not mandatory at all for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober holiday.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
A hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat donuts, communicated the press service, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his employees to take a drink in the aula of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It expects to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned atmosphere of celebration, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the celebration taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized annually, are started with a few welcome words from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating at all for Christmas, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press department of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the strike on an indefinite basis from Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic congestion as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV employees (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions of the League will see the details of their Monday strike on Friday afternoon with the National Workers' Council Association.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be set up as the Monday action coordinator.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Insurance Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not comply with the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide how to proceed.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike scheduled for Monday, important traffic plugs are planned: railways will stop work indefinitely and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, and the list of them is constantly updated on the site of the League.
Some organizations reported that the strike was indeterminate, while others reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Iron Chemins) and the Free Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) have not succeeded in finding agreement on the minimum services, but, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Union of Professors and the Democratic Union of Professors called for a strike for two hours and two hours at 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country, the Union of Health and Social Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new approach to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railways (VDSZSZ), linked to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement pour eine plus Hungary) increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several aspects.
In its "risk warning", society points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Zigan and non-Zigan population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians".
The problem gets worse, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, as a result of greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian right-wing radical and extreme groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the "National Self-Defense Association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inability of the police, of the army, that is, of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was in line with the method that, based on the harshness of the society of politics and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on the civil character and the status of association therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls in the registration of such associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of certain neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, the Constitution of which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma unrest that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to provide a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Tzigans have "terroristized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they will inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law sets out exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become commonplace to reorganise working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Parties are not uniform in both the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national holidays and state holidays as well as days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious celebrations or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the wake-up workers can rest quietly.
Furthermore, in a year we have eleven holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as on October 23, also which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the holiday of work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our deceased family and friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the schedule, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before extended weekends.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been standing in a special regulation on days before or after the holidays.
The Act covers all employers and employees, public servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, to institutions that are continuously and in service, by their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life stops almost throughout the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do more overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and the New Year's day at their home.
Next year a lot of parties fall to mid- or end-of-week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganised for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day for a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from 24 December, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six useless things that can horrendously bother colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost agitate us: these are things that "accelerate" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether they are used to or challenging, and they deliberately avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you they called you marketing," said a colleague.
What did you miss?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the matter is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry with you for stealing their good.
Don't bring in envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be embarrassing that there's no more envelopes and that you'll need them right away.
You're talking about colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop potins spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your personal information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't insult his trust!
Enter the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are aware of it.
Are you sick without just cause?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or think you need to rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not be working or that something may happen that will oblige you to stay at home, do not forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid being surprised by your absence the next day.
Peace, ironing, phone
You dive into your work, but your co-workers' grind you out of it brutally?
Did you become a witness to a phone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with peacemaking, chanting, high-voice discussions (which you're going over their heads), foot beatings, big words or discontents expressed in high-voice.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (edition, design, organization).
Are you blaming the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the specified time, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not accuse anyone for this forgotten!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have done a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages to others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair neglect!
You feel too much at home in the office?
Having a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your job requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm going up to the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones from time to time, then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now it seems that the stopper becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he played himself in the group of Yonderboi before he started on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the Wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records of the Hungarian market and announced Zagar, together with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also compete in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become " trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted as needed, released a new and better disc.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open up new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years at Pécs.
It was a line from the ancient group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the flight reference but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, who recently broadcast popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: Is your music still a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't say much to me.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative music, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
Well, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one of them more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the youth of about ten or twenty years but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course I'm glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the insatiable changes of the moment.
Well, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works on his own and did a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let us deploy.
At first, it was inevitable that our music be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmarès de mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes the lead.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was it the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir of the gospel genre.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song had been in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The rest of the arrangements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the melody that the girls learned later that night.
I almost got it right away and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but certainly we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have a single role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were in the back of the scene too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute roles as a soloist.
The song also says that we have to forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just leave these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted the others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs did you work most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation processes, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "leashed" this disc.
Right now they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is perfidious to the risk of billions because of its complex of inferiority
A hidden fraudster.
In this way, his former employee the French giant designates the General Company, the owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
However, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equalize his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," said his superiors, who denounced him to the police.
However, if we hold to the statement of Kervail reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man at the end of last year have produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered past repayment difficulties, would be problematic.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and he put a lot of money on it.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that, of course, he didn't keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having distorted the reports so as not to be screened.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex scholarship began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so much?
He only made his way to his position gradually.
He started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was around $51 thousand.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university course and my professional and personal career," said Kerviel investigators.
But shortly after he took office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he won half a billion euros by counting on the decline in this title during the Londrès attacks.
And the mechanism was set in motion - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"There was a snowball effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I was winning, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that's when the beginning of the year comes to an end.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
By mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (about SEK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most of the time, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, for research in industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management that are more efficient.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the beneficiaries of the EU funds with the lowest success rate.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (near 1.8 billion crowns).
He later was released and lived in his hacienda near Nicaraguan capital.
If the former head of this Central American state, in function between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be re-incarcerated, according to AP agency, is not yet clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
They were fictional societies and the accounts were actually members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's it.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the opposition's support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, because Minister Sobotka had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate preceding the vote of the statement of defiance to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives has passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is some kind of paradox.
Whether you want it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although it is hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, and that's why he is given more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more of an interest to the opinion than the steep figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not capable of addressing at the same time:
The first is the large share of the mandate costs imposed by law, which are not only made up of pensions, but also of social costs, adopted last year by the silent coalition of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, resulting from the first failure.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest risk.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real bomb is late, it's the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued frivolous bonds, subsidizing their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, in particular those of the energy obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If we stick solely to official and verifiable facts, we can see that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not lacking to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead of doing so, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a terrible shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk from poverty on a global scale.
So we do not need massive social programmes, which have unfortunately, in recent years, been unduly inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures, approved last year before the elections, have been successfully eliminated if a delay in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, will soon not take place, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone who will be in power will be administered.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes the ordinary costs to be reduced by the costs of mandates.
The $70 billion deficit for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give to this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in tax and tax duties, the peace needed to prepare for new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Ji the Krej the Krej
Banks want to resolve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will thus be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are prepared to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, will supply $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address major economic problems, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group's client report.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they really have to understand what can still follow," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he adds.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect world economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to bring down the interbank rate of Londrès, known as LIBOR, used to borrow in the interbank market.
What meant was that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly decreased their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," says Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank's approach will help to bridge the crisis, since it does not resolve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: Green debates are amazing
Global climate change is expected to affect mainly developing countries.
President Klaus once again addressed the issue of global warming.
The criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali this time.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were amazing.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a hint of words, ersatz of solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause as much.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had sufficient provisions to draw up such a book.
He is an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of the climate are normal, there is no shared opinion among all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptably costly.
Especially since he had experience with a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to questions from present persons, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against "integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this subject two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their former driver's licence, the validity of which is due to expire at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permits to drive mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipalities reported a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital were invading applications and the number of licence renewal applications increased this week.
The Town Hall is satisfied with approximately 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour ago.
In Prague, almost 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to ask for delivery within five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will be liable to a fine as early as January.
The guilty person will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to former information, even a person who was not going to travel was likely to be fined.
In so doing, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to be moderated and to impose fines that did not exceed 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one will risk fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide if they want it or not.
It is not like the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should return their driving license.
Just bring it or send it to the municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives charged with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko the former police officers accused of conniving with David Berdych's gang will be 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Prague Higher Court has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by one year and two years respectively.
Initially, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime risked 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal today's judgment, but only an appeal to the Superior Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently awaiting only the first instance verdict.
However, he has already been sentenced in other trials for more than 16 years in prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal convicted 19 persons of participation in the holding-up, and today the Tribunal dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused, since the beginning of the investigation, have questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, members of the police, following inter alia an agreement with Berdych, were transmitting information from police sources to criminals, covering the various hold-ups and helping gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Ko the larceny.
The charge refers to the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999-2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, the victims of which, in most cases, suffered a serious injury to health, but also abuse of authority by a public official and prohibited armament.
During home search, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a core of steel, a laser-direct target, or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other hand-held robberys by Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in Berdych's neighbourhood are still in the process of explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived until the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, avoided Tom the Půta and Maroš Šulej who currently live in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child substitution price: 12 million
Counsel for the disaster families Igor Veleba wants a compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the hospital in Třeb the hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál Hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," said Dostál at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to express an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report of which the opposing party has ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablouov family asked for a million crowns for each month when it could not raise its biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drafted for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subjected to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better borne by men, although they have been confronted with the remorse of not knowing how to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třeb the 9th of December last.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo theov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the hospital in Třeb the region managed.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally subject to liability insurance.
In the event of a failure, they must draw on the reserve base, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, with the amounts calculated in the tables being hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (UK of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the Valašské království (UK of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had actually used the King's title of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom the Harabš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr.Harabš and his team are paralysing Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko refer to everyone just that actor and comic.
Harabš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
The search for money and the development of events," he said.
According to him, the money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to paralyze on our work," he added.
A business-profit
According to the court, Polívka used the title Valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in its television programme.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it had no connection with the plan to create a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabš came with the idea of issuing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humoristic action originally came out a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even offered the holders balances on the price of his farm visit and theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabš only used the bare idea published by Polívka in the Manež program for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the project's soul was formed by Harabš and her team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabš organized for Polívka an official crowning in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabš, which culminated with the statement "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabš and his company, requesting that the court reject it today.
What could make the affair clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the King's parade in Slovencko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Of course, even Mr.Polívka can register," added Harabš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Disappearance of Prejudice
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
Now there is in the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW is going a step further, I only have to think better.
When I tested Peugeot 207's classic hatchback, I complained, for example, about the head space on the back seats.
While this ends the complaints because the bodywork combi means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this respect.
Let's go see what's done.
I'm going to get back inside very quickly so I don't repeat too much.
This is a very successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short folders is over.
Lateral guidance also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also significant.
The combi also sees the lack of space over the above mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is its luggage compartment.
I must evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rotating rear ice) and a rather easy stall.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop in volume.
According to the tables, this figure is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure in relation to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic.
Compared the 207 SW to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very much behind, with a difference of 52 litres.
When it comes to going on leave abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the backrests were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's what a 1.6 that makes a family hashback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot stuck by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's take a look at the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still acceptable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531 900 Kč at the end.
That's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the Fabia price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there is only one left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is not good
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the rest of the population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
UK schools see even cases in which conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous people turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflict between the remaining Slovak opposition and immigrants is beginning to grow, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and fights between students have been incorporated into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty person defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist statements.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage women.
The girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remnants went to call conflicts with immigrants fighting for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 000 Slovaks come to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can be realized if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or lots of intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea islands, you will not find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transfer site of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very beginning of the 20's.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, who made it build, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, were circulating on wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of Havana's Bodeguita.
In the Hotel Nacional bar, a luxury hotel, you can mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, as the jigoulis and the so-called imported fiats have long since, in such a salty and wet climate, rot.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly depressed, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Because tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
For the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is yet another fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train fans.
The cane had come back from the extensive plantations in the sugarries on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives can be seen walking around, whose contemporaries are not only in museums.
To where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viales Valley west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks rise into a candlestick from the bottom of the valley, and the fertile earth has been caught in their midst, even its rotting rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Maybe someone will find it interesting as well that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market of slave trade and sugar that brought it glory and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and the vitreous character of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozděj themi francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři stalí tém themi nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is a place so far apart that in the 50's of the last century there was no road connecting this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
Nothing was being built, and that's why neither was anything being demolished, and everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surroundings, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which animates after the sunset and where the music only sat down in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town on the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and accidental mountains and cross a landscape almost without brands of human activity.
UNESCO has listed the collection of Eastern Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is produced there, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the trip to Colomb) and from the hill where the old chateau-fort and the current Hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several mountain tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the bay of sows and the island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, of the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all that could be filled a number of pages.
Only, as is rightly said, it is better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, claim the Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan was not carried out as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, with representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing dispute by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies today.
While the United States has called NATO troops to more activity this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development aid as a priority.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only form part of the solution.
The other is allowing the inhabitants to start a new economic and security development themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC chain.
Eighty per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent from last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of whom are in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar statements today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," said De Hoop to Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo, which lasted three days.
Who is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts among countries involved in the issue of whether all allies are doing everything they can in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as beavers this week.
"Afghan finans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the state will rise to a trillion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the State exceeding SEK 84,000 is borne by each Czech Republic.
Total debt rose at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a change in the savings of the government budget better than planned, the department reduced the amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year it thus increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, starting in June, it decreased by SEK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its debt data for the state from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding SEK 84,000 is borne by each Czech Republic.
During the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that, due to a smaller deficit planned for next year, the threshold could be exceeded by only one trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek's analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I'm not expecting that change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The debt of the State is financed by bills of the Treasury, interest securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt increased this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the state called negotiable reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and from the month of June it decreased 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which is far too high, given the current good health of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly due to the rents in which it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiations when pension reform comes", commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected
It follows from the government's 2007 financing and debt management strategy, which the government had planned to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, due to a change in the savings of the government budget better than planned, the Ministry reduced the amount planned to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum is mainly made up of the deficit in the state budget, which clearly amounts to SEK 76 billion this year, instead of the SEK 91.3 billion initially planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech consolidation agency, i.e. SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of SEK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state interest securities for SEK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to SEK 1.8 billion.
She was today in court in Khartoum for appointing a puddle bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students between the ages of 6 and 7 giving the name of Mahomet to a pudding bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
She was subject to beatings.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Khartoum University High School in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violations of Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education of the Sudan.
The story goes back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7 years, to choose a name for the class puddle bear.
"Hit names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says Robert Boulos, director of the school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said was only a "innocent error".
Notice shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion meeting in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the Separatist Province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the Statute," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We're not expecting violence in the immediate future, but we're entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "clear voltages exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo last Monday.
The future of the province of 90% Albanian-speaking people could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will present their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council's granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of US administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced Kosovo's President of the Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden Hotel, where since Monday these "negotiations of last chance" took place.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's self-determination plan "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations."
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region that is still fragile by the 1990s' wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted for two years.
They must conclude as they have begun: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be “in consultation” with Westerners.
Bush makes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference, which he was meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities," said Bush, recalling their obligations under the "road map" for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, including "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security."
In turn, Olmert committed that the forthcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort would be made to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing its coexistence "view of two Palestinian and Israeli States".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in that sense of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because he is addressing the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", according to Prince Saudi in his interview with the daily Arab-speaking Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspector General's investigation, a police car was operating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophar," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “unapproved, therefore not allowed to run on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was “very lively”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right,” says a police officer.
The alcohol control carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before being hit, the windshield, the bumper) shows the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had commissioned an investigation for "involuntary homicides and non- assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, co-chaired by the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation by the IMPN, at this stage, was not the police's responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot-and-mouths on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained stuck over the time when the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyd yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which police officers would have left the scene very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IMPN, while being cautious, would also avoid «any serious misconduct» on this point.
"This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we need to be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met with an eye-witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving the scene exactly.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to rejuvenate them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a cop completely hatgard, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youths, the fourth was talking to the phone.”
Faced with the tension that has quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently, with the certainty that the people present in the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left."
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
"I will not say that the police have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right now.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension is rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police have punished Monday's first demonstrations since General Musharraf established the state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
They responded by stone jets, wounding police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers loaded and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped into the powerful Menushida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' urged the people to send flowers to the judges who have pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and hardship to those who have sworn in to Musharraf''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly covered by the exceptional measure proclaimed Saturday evening.
It was due to take a decision in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to President Musharraf on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was expelled and replaced.
''All we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court judgments''', the magistrate said to The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president '''holds no more'' after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He abandoned his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government denied the strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) and poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) are not foreseen, a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) and poorly planned or unexpected births.
The various methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, according to Ined.
Liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed a better 'fertility control', according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated in the next month for a couple in five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential for continuing the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that has accumulated records because of its duration, distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools that astronauts "bring" to perform repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had discharged from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room to receive the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of feed dock for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module, which are 76 metres wide.
And this is where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, was damaged on nearly one metre by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracol at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Big, resistant, very well, it has the tower very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore charged with "operation" of the solar panel "injured".
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the wrong cable and installed some kinds of "tangles" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the Sas and, inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey can of isolating in order to avoid the electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bringed" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth planned Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in stock exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its 2007 operational result forecast following delays in the slow development of the A400M engine, which condition the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of correcting the delay in the delivery of his military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between '' between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus''', announced the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further detail.
The group also indicated that the estimate of new loads was consistent with the delay of six months.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the one for the very large carrier A380.
Initially, The Group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday when the urns leave: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even for authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
In three days of the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to voters on the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of a united Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be found in receiving foreign ambassadors, content with handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of favor during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish for the most honest, transparent and open elections, without any clumsiness," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point of view.
She denounces a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains prohibited from visiting according to her lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the soviet homo"
Behind these unabated legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot enter into a third consecutive term.
But there is no successor.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both legislative and presidential power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," said sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has been delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "voluntarily abandoning the personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
«What good to think?»
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which neither will the Russians vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednichenko, 54-year-old professor: "What is good to think?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million records, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of their management, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to open them up to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Relevant information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to conduct research "including the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers", says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominal documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the Gestapo concentration camps or arrest warrants had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade agreement will greatly affect the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a successful market of 450 million Europeans", explained Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England notes concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday's intention to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve supply during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a press release.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
For the first time, it seems that BoE is placing liquidity on the five-week market in an open market operation.
These normally take one week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it " stands ready to take other measures to maintain interbank lending rates" on a daily basis with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, one higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amount of money placed on the market by the Bank of England had a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the book price in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more discretion.
UPP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS National Office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or the supervision of rents.
As UMP and NC voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted following the general discussion, which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of television intervention by Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law that was considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has inspired, no more or no less, the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres to about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took over from the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Glastonbury qualified as the most inspiring event he's ever seen, C3's Charlie Jones said that his company and Melvin Benn's work is parallel to giving the region a European-style festival event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and working assiduously with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we lost to police because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Thankfully, we have been able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents raised the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after taking a stand in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours take place rather in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulae to give both an impression of a country festival to European and urban to American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to be able to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film records to Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes them...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The Festival Race
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race started.
It will be up to all the West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, to highlight them and to ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The age of darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
At less than five weeks from the end of the fiscal year, investors already rub their hands in anticipation of the arrival of the traditional rally at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December stock exchange generally has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties are in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect towards quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have rather lateral behaviour, not free from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the probable decline in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of the stimulation of inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," assures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the party of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inverse Banco, estimates that we are close to the technical levels and "that is why we could observe a resurgence of the index that could be triggered according to the information coming from the European Union with regard to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum seats.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electrical sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha, of Inverse Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event that they do so.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
cyclic consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions in December were a month down.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computerizing its end-of-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10:30 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also repeated several times that he would like to amplify the schedules of his branches, BBVA, although he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is seeking.
To attract self-employed customers who travel in these areas to buy in SMEs and street stores chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the various streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the inside of the branch and a new, more modern design with brighter colors.
The bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of personnel, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very extended schedules, who even open Sundays and public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers, ' says Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in the stock exchange of his rival Antena 3
We did it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a small market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (plus 13%) thus reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other joint ventures listed in the stock exchange is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are capable of doing, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that it is planning to become this year's first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco's and Publiespaña's deputy advisor, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel should record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to for the best relative development of Telecinco in the stock exchange is the important pay out which he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarriía distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after purchasing 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is explained by the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the profit forecast for Antenna 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress's vote on amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the rules that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation that would guarantee investor protection and to regulate the activities of organizations in detail so that markets would function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, at the time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons and individuals or legal entities and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it is increasing the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep records of all transactions they conduct, in order to facilitate the monitoring of the NMCC.
In passing through the Congress's Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the debt-to-be will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proved itself with what has happened with the debt of US high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the implementation of management to legally delimit the functions that graduates of Economics may have 30 years after the approval of the Royal Decree in 1977, which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman's, which will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the approval of CNMV and which will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and the attraction of new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14th.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has specified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to cover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12.000 (EUR16.800 million) since it came into crisis in mid-September and have had to use an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was picking up a few record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure which is gradually dropped in two and a half months because of his clients' distrust and despite the guarantee of 100% of that money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these remaining 18,000 million pounds up to the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnat group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of Virgin's association, in which three other companies, including its favourite, are participating to save him from the highway.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in early morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of its alleged relationship with the scene of urban corruption discovered this week.
ADE plus, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's me Juan Morales, the current MP of the right, and until then the municipal councillor of the municipality, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'leader' of this platform.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of new stops is not excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption scene, found early this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the Chain SER to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the house of Morales with important documentation in his possession of the tram.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged cashing of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
There are currently eight detained persons.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it to him during a press conference after the meeting which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of Le Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who announced on 15 November that he would not be presenting himself to the next general elections and abandoning his political career in the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, although the citizens already know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce that it will preside over Congress in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "likes more and more to citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had praises for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge of doing" and he did not want to do as if he already occupied his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might view as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to merciless persecution of both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate consistency of iron.
This is particularly the case for a leader of the movement who is the President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading the European Union in failing to implement the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-execution, in which areas it has occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will have to do, what economic consequences will that have?
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there was no one, and there would be no explanations.
It is precisely because it is a matter of sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for businesses and individuals.
Up to the one hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party appeared to him literally so dangerous to Zapatero that he was eager to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, that do not denounce and that do not demand, adorn meetings and inspire tenderness.
As long as this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim to what we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and head of the local police in Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the town council and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, informed today of the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at the moment many officers met, who also presented themselves as Urbanism Municipal Advisor and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged with the judicial investigation, which Totana's No. 1 Tribunal instructed.
The first six detainees have now passed to a court order.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliament of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a property agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes would have been realized.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the UCO Group of Urban Délits of the Gendarmerie Centrale Operative Unit, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in companies related to detainees in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played an intermediary role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of over 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been requalified and its project would require doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inronuar, which deal with the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with the direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building materials.

Our correspondent from Finland gives us the commentary from yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (Certificates of information PISA above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the philosophy course has called public opinion into question as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that the professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight to a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the one imposed for downloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participation in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and CD traffic would involve a six-month to two-year sentence
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without author ' s authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'The money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
That is, the feelings that the monthly pay of workers generates depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out with tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany, "The greatest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
Researchers observed that when both people felt that they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them was receiving double, activation was larger.
I don't know if that conclusion would require so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been perpetuating Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Its term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - ex-General Ratko Mladic and ex-leader Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still in freedom.
Their names are in this list, the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes his name, 'Carla's list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the pace of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York, who pursues the criminals fleeing and puts pressure on the governments involved to reduce the circle.
What kind of insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of potential claims, entails a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the actual use, among others.
Having a car is the most important.
There are, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es inclusiveo más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it's that choosing the proper auto insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the cost of insurance, which is calculated taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or actual use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
This is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have lower claims from their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probability increases.
They are many of the variables that insurers consider when setting the premium price.
That's why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his/her profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when selecting one or the other type of insurance, so that the insurance company, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age must face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as may be the lack of experience in driving and the seniority of driving licences.
While the ideal for being well insured is insurance at all risk, other more economical options exist.
The most predictable drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with no charge, so that they get the coverage of all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the client pays will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be lower," explains Luis Noguera, the head in charge of First Europa Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age trying to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, since this will impact on the rebate, which may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A discount is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The rewards and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," said Noguera.
Over the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced due to accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation allows him or her.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be persons with the lowest claims rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance at all risk without charge (may be 300 euros), or a third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of credit.
"They have a more casual conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchisees," said Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (by being EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high level of credit.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of potential claims, but also because it represents a significant expense, it is therefore essential to properly study the insurance that is most appropriate to us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are meeting next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point that they lack in order to achieve their respective goals in closing the League of Champions, as it serves the Italians to be the first and the Scottish to be ranked.
The Italians total ten points and they already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a blank match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not go ahead of him.
Both of these Group D games will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC will have to fight the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month looking for a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero game at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that winning it would stay first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to computer only on this, since with nine points the game comes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to take the evening to the Scottishs, who have good hope of ranking for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in the event that the Celtic would lose, to be ranked for the eighth finals to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, since the group disbanded in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said little time before starting their concert at the GM Place Vancouver stage that the group meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the history of the band that made it furious at the end of the 1990s is told.
The encounter and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes its main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five Spice Girls members went on stage showing the bracelets offered to them by the wife of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience who filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned it a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British football player "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
' Sporty Spice ' which was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group's dissolution two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings have changed, the feelings for Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate a lot".
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special aircraft from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibiting in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibiting on December 23rd.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine is throwing the alarm.
A dispute over the price of solid gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most exports of Russian gas to the European Union (U.E.) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a change between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the US countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian gas-owned monopoly company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would include an increase of 40% in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major change between Moscow and Kiev resulted in the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Department of Scottish Health needs to improve controls on its extra-Community employees to verify that they have previous criminal records, said the Monitoring Committee.
The Auditor General's warning, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of people working overseas.
Its report nevertheless highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out controls on extra-Community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having darkened with his jeep in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on previous criminal cases, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that the committees are required to face up to the Bureau of Control of Previous Penals, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have found that some personnel information has been properly verified, this is not always done."
Mr. Black stated that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment controls it would carry out itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that pre-use controls currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities said 1161 people from overseas, most of whom were doctors and nurses, were employed.
However, the reviewer general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of problems relating to the identification of staff with indeterminate contracts, who could choose whether or not to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for controls by the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are entirely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its pre-employment policy and system of controls for non-ocean health personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would commit itself to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including overseas individuals.

The fifty-year-old director, filming films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' follow-up, The Kingdom of Cristal.
Winston stated that he was proud to receive this award named Star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."

Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Conflicts
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells that manage an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against the clergy and armed forces.
The state-of-the-art television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al-Qaeda's supporters have launched a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell consisting of eight activists, headed by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack of Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the activists planned the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have completed the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The Government requested the clergy to do more against Saudis headed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda's militants fighting against the Allied Forces and the Muslim government allied to the United States, considered heretical along the hard line of Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have worked with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Occident Saudi government, by Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces in these last five... months," said the spokesman for the Interior Minister on state television.
Inmates include 16 members of the Media in a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against the infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday stated that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European orbital ship showed that the planet is certainly twice as small than the Earth, unlike previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to the Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a hot enough temperature surface to melt lead there.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
The professor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from the Earth, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
The uranium enriched by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was captured by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Open to All
Mitt Romney said he was not a candidate for the presidency, to answer a good snowman's questions.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate at You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who had registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28th, none of the questions raised was as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position on the global warming.
But this time the questions and answers have reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board raised approval increases when candidates expressed grossly.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the lead of the major advance elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodative about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (providing illegal status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have succeeded in deepening this topic.
None of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and incisively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with concerns particularly about toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the outside world, favours Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between liberators and Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to state that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about to believe Jonas's story and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee - in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus had been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too clever to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The rise of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent tremendous research of grants by liberator Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two came out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that both of the party's protected parties are unable to agree to decide who is the more well-known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in a timely and convincing way with a message of success on the American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Work List
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to darken; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills for politicians, no extra marital finger sucked.
But here is a revelation that a rich businessman would have been hiding for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle of which Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister took a step backwards in his draft election, foolishly insulting British intelligence, proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal leader, declared that the terrorist Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's buy-back, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, has shown a lack of direction and poor judgment in case of emergency.
The inadequate proposals to change the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
Currently, the suspicion of loose donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labour List (and his ex-Chief of Vigilance) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound for the exit.
However, Governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not have confidence in them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, nor even govern things for a long time, when he risks the suspension: the public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock of things; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In one sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, relate to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misery, such as the long investigation into the party's funds "money counting for the members of the House of Lords", the voters might think the opposite.
But Mr Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic as it seems.
Gaffes aren't as terrible as Tories' party members think.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scammers.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to bring the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown into effect forever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal of political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians' big subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who will contribute to the success of those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams's programs, not knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as did Mr. Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, although most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent Chair for the Independent Committee on Public Living Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would require the Labour Party, at a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead him to abandon his special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr Brown.
But he should face some biasing facts.
The Conservatives' party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate an irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see excited fins, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is undergoing a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in charges and insolvency rates, which measure or are not recovered shares of the balance sheet, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly due to the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 concerning the personal banking system caused an abrupt fall in the banking system, which in turn resulted in heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the borrowing conditions were to increase.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers could prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flows rather than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payment fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to re-establish the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of action.
"We're not gonna wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Capital One's director Gary Perlin.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to testify to their roles in relation to fraud committed by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusive fraud charges committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should come to court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges they were charged with in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" declared to have come to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of an Enron-controlled partner, Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to trick the banking system.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the bank interest of the subsidiary for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest to this company.
According to the defendant, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company had a deposit of $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But truly these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have won $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is detained for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after paying a $1million deposit each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, on the road in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its slum speculation as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former President-in-Office Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were lost due to her death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles without a stopover of $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs as many seats as it's more than a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy that is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians in their diverse products, ranging from yachts in mahogany to cars filled with diamonds such as 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We lived the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the biggest global expense.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for selling luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, who total $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, Davis Morris representative, London jeweler.
She took part in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Gijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the lounge, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who seized her high-knit dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The lounge seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to tail in the plugs to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canvases, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund toy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand-made.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too depending on Russian standards) have already switched from shining logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the trade fair.
In spite of this, thousands of people, i.e. millionaires, millionaires' issuers or tourists, survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and gold threaded cotton.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that teamed the cars with last-crying alarm systems, also said he sold to a millionaire Russian, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three similar cars to bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be incrusted with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"there's more to it than you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire trade fair.
Passers stopped to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or a few million.
"You see, everyone here in Moscow can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass-screened bay of Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, resident in 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicological tests, which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should be able to resolve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"it was like a pit bull"
« she would have done everything to protect me »
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-police officer from Newark who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Board, and that she left two 14 and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, stated that the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgery.
"This is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they arrived at her home at around 3 p.m.
And found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities did not say much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical firm.
Wednesday, no one opened the door of Melle Castro's house, where a paved rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front of it, and a Dalmatian leaned at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two bikes all on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her political culture.
"She said, "You must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rates associated with the strengthening of the global stock exchange.
The shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the appealing statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in Londrès, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, no. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their shares in agitated financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the irritable markets, given these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence in part "reversed some improvements in the operation of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persisted, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that ultimate decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londrès, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In Londrès, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than 39£ to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was brought to light following the high demand for a monthly tri-fund auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject funds into the London financial markets causing tensions in credit, have led to the monthly 'Libor' borrowing rates to British banks, causing their highest growth since last September, to 6.59% following a sharp upturn since November 12.
England faces an appeal against the verdict against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be England's No. 6 drummer in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the selector's president, who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, take his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selector, at least in part-time.
Anyone who fails to win the #6 dossard will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another one will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck more than because of a lack of skill.
Not only is selection difficult on cricket, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to bring Bopara out?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new managers who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cracker unless he is given at least one chance?
The numbers are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cracker must catch the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the cracker of one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, when James Anderson seemed certain to be playing the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who managed to become the primary cracker of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double mark against Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's Asgiriya session, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and remarkable beginning at the 88-year-old test in Bombay, 32 cents first class versus 6 for Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test in Lord, his city of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, demanded his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum at Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is happy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket ground and he exaggerated when he recently capped himself on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only postponed minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (donate well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him if 'he had seen that?'
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his driving edge allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing just man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can it be the real art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has recovered normality.
Some have returned to fight against activists who have been away from their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported to convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr Sunni.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and the city is more secure now."
"They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher from the Sunni area of Amarijah, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S. aided militia, allowed Al Qaeda to hunt from the western part of the capital, and invited him home.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he encouraged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to put in place an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing acquittal of the capital since the U.S. troops arrived, and in view of the continued formation of "groups of involved citizens" well armed and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the loss of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51-year-old father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exiled visas that Prime Minister Shia Nouri al-Maliki, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to forcing people to return home.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian squadrons of death.
"we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give Iraqis visas, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decline in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were hunted from the Shia and vice versa areas, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state conducts vocational training, even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarroese, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derition, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the monitor of the training of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This shows the high ratio of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools above average - many of them without a degree from the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system", says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people get their education in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the dual course panel is Germany's second best.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education in Sardinia has forced schools to carry out a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout the federal state.
For children to start learning earlier, the final crèche year is right-free - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will show whether the performance of the students is improving sustainably.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Sarre did not improve as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And despite the Sarroese, foreign language knowledge is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise points could be gained in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is compulsory in high school - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Check the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be tick-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will be raising the chronometer of half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official Venezuelan newspaper communicated, due to a new law, watches will be settled at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "hidden in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringing makes the country furious: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already over half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain, Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was enraged by the constant interrogations of the left-wing populists and told him to shut down.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a prognosis, a real undervalue of the wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their predictive pessimistic.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their pay slips in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, "in the newspaper Bild".
New costs could also be incurred in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected drop in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to ask the Federation for appropriations or financial assistance, according to the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and oil prices had led to an increase in the inflation rate at its highest level over the past 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twinle of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European Space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those appearing on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there is light on Venus.
Today, the European "Venus Express" probe has demonstrated this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightnings on Venus burst to a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, says Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: thunder would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life existed, it must have been at a very old time in history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington, D.C.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twinle of the Earth, but it remains a twinle," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probe was in progress for the exploration of this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more numerous than supposed at first.
In addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, the researchers found a cloud turbine at the south pole, which is running much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoca.
The second solar system planet has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The world that is qualified as a star of the evening or morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venezuelan day lasts 243 terrien days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party dispute over the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancery.
In an indirect manner, he criticized the SPDs for attacks against the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition to close the dispute about the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not introduce a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy from China.
The German Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional policy of a single China.
"China also knows it," said Köhler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the welcome of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU.
In particular, Steinmeier complained about the CDU's "frontline policy" on foreign policy.
After the welcome of the Dalai Lama to Chancery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now demands that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the welcome of the Dalai Lama was an error.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official office, thus supporting Wen Jiabao’s Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fights with the police, shots, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to violence in the streets, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades that burn, breakers that shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the severe riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not occur in our home as well and decompose into violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to the New Press in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From summits of integration to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But action would still be necessary.
Kolat stresses that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be above the average.
More training places should be provided in the first place.
Kolat insisted, "We need to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Youth should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian falcon of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flying over the area with headlamps.
The authorities in place reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, approximately 1,000 security forces have been deployed calmly.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the city of Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the trouble was spilling over to Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian entrance of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there is nothing left to wait for her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After his horrendous intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The accusation of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel by a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was neither real interest nor little feeling in the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in apesant, fleeing into foreign politics and even remaining there in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it is once again welcoming the Holydam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of himself - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it two years ago.
Now it cramps itself to all the formulas made, that growth would touch people.
In this way it destroys its image as a pragmatist, which solves problems rather than embellish the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He still has a few additional phrases for this.
In this respect, the number of times it is lapsus when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
In this case Merkel needs three start-ups in order to pronounce a precise sentence.
She's in the unknown field, starting from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already shines on the first subject.
He reportedly made New York a "hide for the underground," Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one on his side with heavy accusations: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals" answered Giuliani and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base does not have official favourites, the eight candidates to the presidential use the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain says to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go back in time beyond the war in Iraq and discussions on torture are seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Hall in Florida.
Whether the conservative values are rented or future tax increases are denied, applause emerges in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites reappear.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney and apologizes to the base and the television audience for having been still in favour of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes through a loophole when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilians for the first time.
One day after his withdrawal as Chief of the Army, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as President.
Thus eight years of military domination end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his chief of army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus been subject to international pressure, especially that of the United States.
Eight years after its take of power by a coup without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of his rank, had dismissed last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock's fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s are replaying: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared records of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at night.
Everyone has their small box in front of him, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes that goes inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again assured some of the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, certainly, the name justifies in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case in such a durable way that this group is also painfully missing for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is known as "Krautrock" is more and more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the interviewers' German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped to the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and only during this period, the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly deprecated in Kraftwerk and had finally made himself a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Community I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a fanion of Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many felt Harmonia far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album was called "De Luxe".
For as serene and fashionable as the music sounded, the band suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for itself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, and someone thinks they remember.
At that time, Rother expressed the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (Hearts in Flames).
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Live album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Granted publicly, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole range of variation in the influence of the Krautrock would be determined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase in the room in the midst of the singular sounds: "The only true music you listen to the future".
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of tools cabled in bazar serve to form the legend.
In the face of this, the three veterans are again busy improvised.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and the battery, to draw instruments from the silent sounds thanks to instruments with self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in the big stickers of technique.
Even the choir of the house will change nothing.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's direction, you cough and shush under the cloud of sounds, and you sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought after in the blues than in the Conservatoires de Musique (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia too is now no longer being irritated by this.
But what goes best will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and end?
This can tap someone's nerves (?) or give away moments of great joy.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Covering Peace", two films again began the Balkan war.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and the exchange of insane or, on the contrary, they are too lax.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
First of all, the good news: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely here, in the most luscious backcountry of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
In the end, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice roles and futiles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with his desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to still watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes hunted (Why should today's films be as long and confused as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of blinks of eye: in the bottom, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry were not as good as it was: a man who has his best moments behind him for a long time, but who, even as a monument to his decline, kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this advantage, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Covering Peace", which is also coming out this week, the endless follow-up of films missed on the Balkan war.
The trial is quick: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's franc-tireurs, in which one of the two falls still in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are for once not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film is as flat as a telefilm loses too fast in action and the exchange of insane shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are making themselves available for the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both at once Richard Shepard), another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories look strikingly similar: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the soldiers can't do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give it a romantic adventure with a Bosnian then murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world's premium hunters did not succeed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague of Crime against Cinematic Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to state that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspects the Americans and the French (where they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt quite intensely because of secret political agreements.
But the intended good and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to us to the idea.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: "Compatiously, I see the veins of the inflated front, clearly: as it is tiring to be wicked."
The films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkans war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa.
What is valid every time: when a star pulls on a home of crisis or on a minefield, he then finds something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or ""Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could shoot a good movie on the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature - those who today value classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have in no case been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also now know too much about the world's conflicts, where every hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delights the writers the lack of scrupulouss they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became so good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrific way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The decline of the mayor with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has met with critical criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the Waterside Games.
But Von Beust calls to realism in appreciation of chances.
The main director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as being "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes another modified agenda as the starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means, for us, that in the span of time that we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong permanently to the past," said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, by burying projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the candidacy would be in contradiction with the statements made by the Chief of the Senate at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools in Sport.
Down there, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiads as not "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Fédération des écoles supérieurs du sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic map and excluded housing construction," said the MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "factor Event".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for its part, would have aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
It's not the Warhols caisses.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At this time, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the eighty-nine "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxs listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disillusioning result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum presented in 1995 at Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is intertwined, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cartoning factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exposure samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden caisses, which at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes authorized by Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached over $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed, later on, that about one hundred wooden caisses had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have handed over to him.
Indeed, the 105 caisses de Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
On that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, curator-in-chief of Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, and then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies that date from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the painting was directly applied without a background layer on the stratified panels, using a painting roller - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These caisses have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", says the director of Moderna Museet Lars Nittve: "If the "Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board" in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of soap boxes in powder.
But since then we've had an inexorable silence.
Manila's rebel soldiers give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had retired from a hotel in Manila, and had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer any bloodshed.
The faithful soldiers in power had attacked the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been cut off for hours in the building.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly explode with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers, who were normally to monitor them, apparently had deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power shut down the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Councillor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other army units were about to join the march.
The regime ' s criticisms had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila had already been the scene of a mutiny attempt by about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke out nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
The United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We'd already been speculating on a buy-back before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, the aim is to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, has communicated United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made about an entry on Wednesday, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, is said to be in the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 percent of its stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has invested 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros in the Stock Exchange.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million euros for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the MSP interest company to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and do not use their right to add 18.49 percent to Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
However, both companies would be left with all the options open, especially to increase participation in the Freenet SA, which has been learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The hard still predictable Freenet poker that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers connected by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide about four percent more.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
