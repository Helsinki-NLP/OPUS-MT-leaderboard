28-year-old cook in San Francisco Mall found up
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother said that he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, "Finally, he went uphill again."
The body found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS KGO station in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, got his dream job as a cook six months ago at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank lived first in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO told.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
It was his way of connecting it to his family that it was always to cook something for us to prepare dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, which brightly lit every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's call number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has made this clear.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get labeled from outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to always be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more pretty to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress likes to spend her time at home, in the form of a TV with loose dutts and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
She asks the question about the desire for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is No Children's Game", Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of a change with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home in the fast gallop to the feeding trouges.
One kilometer at that pace, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses.
He was led by his family through the ALRV facility, and did not even swerve on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the friendly athlete.
Federal Merit Cross, Silver Lorberblatt, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British queen has already anointed him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was recorded in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The outstanding athletes include Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, Spring rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthume handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree with tax and energy policy as well as on a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, says Trump.
It will massively reduce regulation, and it will promote a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has to fulfil certain tasks, has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for that.
Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they have to be invested in it almost exactly the same.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical teaparty wing, for example.
So Trump could still have in-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal production back to the US.
Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Convention on Climate Change should be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment programme and calls for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be paid better then, for example Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage has to be up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, it is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics are suggesting that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is not more than one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother's staring at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is Head of the Condrobs Division, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-spoiled women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich women's aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as a visitor.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It's not excessive to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her run," says Bahr.
"People flee because of wars, because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a means of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsion, murder of honour, slavery or prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
On the run, that goes on.
"For example, that towpers demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone; they are not protected from their families.
Who believes that this will end when they arrive in Germany is mistaken, says Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, worst of all, abused.
This results in that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized.
"Some of the children certainly did not come into being voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experienced, because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence is answered by some with No.
There is no such thing in government housing in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconians, for example.
Even women who are refugees are not housed separately in Schwaben, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franks there are floors in some common accommodations or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the Committee says: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If privacy is wrong or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can come about - persistently."
In particular, washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study states.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be read on the Andang, which there is at the house in Munich.
"Since speaking around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistance doctors strike: Calls for new work-related measures
Deputys of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new work-related measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA)'s Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire council to approve more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it would have failed ministers to address the concerns about the Treaty.
In July, assistants and medical students voted against a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Ellen McCourt's chairman said that the government had remained "silently quiet" to problems, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC board of directors has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and has called for formal renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalation work struggles beginning in early September.
The disputes led to a six-fold strike of assistants this year, the first total outages in the history of NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted during the meetings that were held before the vote by 54,000 medical assistants and students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be introduced for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants the most of this reconciliation.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed fluffy and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed more to me to indicate the opposite.
But a sustainable cold radiated by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the rejection of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin declared and accused Ankara of falling into Russia's back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a violent, full attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations by senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to make some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was removed last month in a failed coup almost his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights resume.
They count on a late seasonal storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, the continuing horror at the speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West - is coming.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a self-evident thing for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit meeting at this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described it, "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries, which are dissipating from the West and feeling ill-treated and now joining forces.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even addressed the issue.
The President of Turkey avoided deliberately answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s managing director, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has been distancing since then when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other final consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for retail business that will be of greater importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predlection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th.
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He placed on Predlection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the cheer when he takes the victory at Predlection
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He's been a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiast fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the landmark of the British Flat Race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, when he returned from his six-month lock, he initially had difficulties, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his twins and return to his best form.
And he's still not in the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he's at least 50 years of age.
Russia’s Putin Fires Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin ordered "Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reasons".
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaero, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it is said that he was later the head of the protocol and staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as a Head of State with regard to legislative proposals and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaero as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russia's environmental policy at once - came up against great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me to this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov joined the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set, there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details on how the characters of Gibson's series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been present since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal minds and have put my whole heart blood in the past twelve years," said Gibson in a announcement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcasting of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Riddles of fish landing in a garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandal, spitted out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers", which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scavengers.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Today, Keith Brown, Minister of Economic Affairs, visited the construction site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in its place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth receives a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock is a major milestone for every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high- and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the expanding Nordturmdeck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a rise of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Happy to be alive"
Three men have "to be still alive" after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit BST alarm on Friday at 13:20 after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties swimming in safety while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around in its vicinity and the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, director of the rescue station.
"Unfortunately, the strong winds have waved the boat beyond its range until we left in water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was known.
Someone was watching these men today.
He's seriously injured - man stands up for his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offenders cut apart the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her life mate, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life mate.
On the street, they met the husband's ex-husband.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPDs and Greens believe that investors will be taken much more into account in future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "acceptance of housing" at the next Council meeting.
But disputes are programmed.
First of all, it is a question of who should build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be social housing."
However, the favourable apartments can also be created in existence.
However, Bratmann said that the main point of dispute in the town hall was: "What about investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as far as possible 20 percent of housing as social housing."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tough demands for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is worsening.
If the action plan is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're gonna get the professionals.
However, the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of more or less 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning politician Nicole Palm said that it was now necessary to buy end-of-life bonds from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into the price-fixing process.
This is possible in the western city.
One by one, the problem could be solved.
In the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: That's what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
For the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically again, one is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of social weak people in just a few areas of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, president of the group, says: "The CDU must be in the boat for a broad majority."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
But what doesn't mean is that a compromise can't be found.
Pokémon Go, a health and happiness hunt that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens has been complained of by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games and lastly to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overburdened the server.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who are tracked by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (through a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was still younger joined the madman and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently announced to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people who train every day 30 minutes increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to get to "take 30 minutes of time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to indicate here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something in the open, that they have fun.
This covers three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also muritic destroyers who must always complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with active activity in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
It's easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the floor.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-game title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and the final five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles will be on the swing bar during the single multiple women's tournament finals at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American who wins a multi-game title and, overall, the fifth while strengthening her reputation to be the best of her generation or even of all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought her sports to new heights:
Bales has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the Spring, Texas family with a handful of gold would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in a single multi-game women's tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-game competition, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Vibration beams and ground turns - in which Biles holds the world champion's title - laurels.
She recovered with 15,433 on the suspension bar - and placed another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently when they expected her endowment - a pure formality - and tears flowed on bales glossy red, white and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake at Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
With regard to Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: Killed 3 victims in serial murder while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed in one of the deadliest attacks of a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks within four months in Hispanian residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Malaah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't let myself get involved with that.
What's not right at all -- of course they let themselves in on it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know people were still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can walk with assistance and ride a bike.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has conceived for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an unknown future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Massive rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected that more rains will take place all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for submarines, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone would have asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
An flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In southern Alabamas a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued raining in the area of Mobile.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metreologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as it will only slowly flow through the step-by-step rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still caught people from the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his step-son were among those saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said he was warned by another step son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
Hansford told his wife that in the 48 years she lived there she would never have seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers saved all three in a large military truck and took them to the next fire department in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread "quickly" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were reluctant to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported rain near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the soil has been very full of rains since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure of education in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both now flooded.
The principal of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the flood.
In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the town of Tangipahoa almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floods and sandbags provided for the inhabitants to take away, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses are supposed to have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no ones have been reported.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents claimed that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the hip, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was licked by bullets," his grandmother Delore's Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge shells for storm rifles, which were traced back to various storm rifles, left the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were shells.
This seems to have been the case with several armed fighters who were very active," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was met by a cross-stack on her arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm thinking under the women's Olympic team in the tournament for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, which rounds Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has reinforced the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and American.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful Gymastics.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-game event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how turn classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five", because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that tournaments are an expensive sport and gymnasiums are primarily in private gymnastic clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gyms and families).
The majority of these tournament clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to be more manageable and easily accessible.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnast.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality youth tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, made her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract necessarily and said that the NHS was in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at young times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians announced last night in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks came to the attention of the government on opposition and sometimes on deafening silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, lift the compulsion and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work.
The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to conclude the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 doctors who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, asked the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working measures do not reach only little, but already burden overburdened teams and service providers and only prepare patients, nurses and their families for anxiety, distress and interruption."
In the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to concerns about the care and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a vocational period, training centres, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of myocardial infarction patients will benefit from one £2 per day of medication, after the authorities have recommended that more people should be administered for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medication is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or further heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing materials in the artery walls that form surfaces.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guide from NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily dose of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guide does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness makes election fraud bloom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report published today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockouts outside of electoral chambers in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommended that voters should carry an identity card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to mention his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they give their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only against electoral fraud, it is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court decided that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is supposed to have "run his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent election of letters - where older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to vote for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the conduct of identification to prove identity
The report states: "As evidence it has been shown that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There was concern that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists editing correspondence documents to stop "chosen" people.
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as it has given its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists process full correspondence and envelopes of correspondence.
The police give the power to set up arrests for polling stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).
Photography ban in polling stations.
Requirements that only English may be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal charges were filed.
"The electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for corrupt and illegal practices because of a litany," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high standards of criminal law - for being guilty.
He also criticises the ineffective "checks on withdrawals" of the election registration departments of the City Halls.
Sir Eric said, "The trial in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's biker double ganger and other famous Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio this week have come across French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of the margin and band, who proved to be an impressive double ganger of the Duke of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympionikin is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold who has his own famous doubles - at least not if you can give faith to the social media.
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flirting on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double walker on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star eeriely similar.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been getting to hear that he looks like Leo since his childhood.
"I don't see much likeness myself, except for facial hair," said Brady to the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused this year: the striking similarity between British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to go through as a double walker for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A bit higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athlete version" of the Inception actor
Another continuous comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-blown skin and blonde hair, such as actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was shown by fans to be similar to an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in the room: According to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner at the Gabby Douglas tournament, which shows her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swimming season indignant spectators of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
The Canadian station CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief went off" and during the race like "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swing stage.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board by CBS commentators to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost her connection, baby".
Too excited, went down like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Visitors across Canada quickly responded online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmet Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig?"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old chinese has lost her connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how unsensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our audience on the show and to our followers in the social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim in the CBC Olympic show, he said.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no contempt was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark embarrassed about woman who tried shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes out in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she patterned her appearance in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put them back into the shelf
One mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she moved back on and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the outfit, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underwear before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, moved back on and went out.
"It didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting it would be to think that someone underpants would take home who had a different person and were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I was told, the employees tried to remove the garments from the market after she went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had to wear them and went out again and they weren't washed."
One speaker from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August in our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit his face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee and turn the gun out of his hands while the attacker bends out of his hands with his face running and move backwards while they point the gun at him.
In case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
Drop the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker's chest, then turn the gun out of his hand before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi feels.
But remember, it's safest for a robbery to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright shakes his tongue in the most dirty places in Europe for a guide
A British traveller subjected his immune system and vulture flex to serious examination - by licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his train on a Euroschein, a field at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a tractor toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would get into.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of licking the sink button of a tractor toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repugnant, but in fact more bad bacteria are found in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left behind more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lands at railway stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task definitely put its immune system under a sample
In the film he said: "Already as a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely satisfied with his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample strip showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different locations, such as the bathroom.
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet, close."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I won't lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gephilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call him."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had to lick him, just as the disgusting Russian toilet is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to make Ian lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed were associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 percent stated that they use at least occasionally products containing the attached lactic acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social home after a delocation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the cohabitation found property in an irreparable state.
The walls had hollow holes, wooden shelves were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she is afraid that the apartment should no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had committed included street fighting with baseball batters, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past, wooden floors have been torn apart
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
Delogation was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were turned into hell.
One of them said, "They didn't make fun of anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say the police here are incredible.
"Today tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have neglected the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the crowded side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added:"It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, since a delocation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be seen terribly.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who bravely approached us and sent us the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had confessed guilty of the possession of a Class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were embroidered with graffiti.
The police say they're going to deregulate tenants who don't comply with house order.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police announced that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is about those who think they can behave without self-proclaiming, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists panic in Portugal after flying over a deep-flyed military jet beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft landed an incredible crash
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment to panic in the fear of a tourist after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity over the sunbeds on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up as they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "There was twice a very deep flight and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, the area fires in the vicinity were slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
Land fires destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal this summer, with four people also dying on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first stage in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans enter the Duell around the Spanish Supercup out against the FC Sevilla, the playback rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner will have to do away with Neymar, among other things, with the inferior cup finalist and ruling European League champion, who will contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
There is also a lack of Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stiegen.
The German experienced a band dive in the knee during the training, which at least in favor of Claudio Bravo has clarified the question at Barca.
The Chilean International and Ter Stages have been fighting for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique forgave a clear decision on this so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stiegen in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish champion about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated in a 0:4 test game by Liverpool on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn't really know how to convince even at 3:2 in the Probegalop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "Titelverteidiger" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour finals and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia strip was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, and between the sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had withdrawn to the rostrum and let their protectors go alone in a fair competition.
"I've played the matches for my country so far."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had correctly said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posing with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the pace on the record and left Zhang there only a total of 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not lead to the expected winning match.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to see.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had committed an injury to the ribs, after which he had to undergo medical treatment, he had to "sufficiate" with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedens Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic Four in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump presents enormous problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republics is plagued by massive concerns to lose its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
President-in-Office Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as those reported by correspondents.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubt is growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilty were false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media chelte.
Waking Republican Uphills
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same table.
Other institutions, however, do see Trump ahead, not by the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview with the CNBC, Trump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance Clintons again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday".
He's doing nothing but "telling the truth."
If, at the end of the day, it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, then Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party is said to have threatened to remove funds to support his campaign, so he should not be able to present better polls.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress would be better placed to stand up for the Congress.
Olympia: Three-star fraud in doping testing
The IOC wants to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's athletic athletes threaten Ungemach after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After an attempt at fraud at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had passed a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, an IAAF speaker reported.
"Depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," was stated in an IAAF Declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the test and signed it," explained Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become a World Cup Fourr over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing.
The Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games four days earlier.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against cash payments in his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games by the IOC was unusually preceded by the announcement that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into the eye.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
Subsequently, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fighting is in line with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The national athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, it has been repeatedly accused that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
Richard Pound, a member of the IOC, called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this type of sport has been comprehensively and systematically baptized.
Russia's athletic athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornd Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classicalism and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra is buried under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he whispers.
We always say it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony with sadness, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and wit and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is very up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
According to reports, Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she intended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered an aircraft towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, Leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate of the Democrats, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the McConnell Senate believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton yet if she was going to nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Appellation Court of the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, Lacaia and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found Donald Trump to be inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
The treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nudity magazine differed from oldschool playboys because "playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to return to portray timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality reckons with mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen- near-Stiftung Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of asylum seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes the association president Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Federation President Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already overtaken Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the vain coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that even absorbs refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish cities, but also in Alevitian cities.
This will increase Erdogan's exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany too, a "Hexenhunt" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen- near-Stiftung Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As reported by the newspaper calling for figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already in front of the coup the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On 30 June, this had been 11.386 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all those entitled to asylum (39.625).
This survey does not include those who fled from war, poverty or from the perspective of impoverishment.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively politically, i.e. individually persecuted by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For it is not more stupid than it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and national elections - that bites.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not have to choose the country day.
In addition, practical problems arise: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and finally count votes, are only hard to push up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must let the people pass the election campaign.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks off from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and jokes a little with the people, just as he did his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blames for the flowering of the AfD.
Her policy of refugees, her "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make the right place for elections at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there as Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not harm anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North East CDU largely refrains from the usual electoral positions on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that it is breaking the ground in the country, that it has to make a great effort to find a new wire for the people.
You go like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exist.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Since much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still won clearly at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and mainly put their election campaign on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it is called the state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just bends through the Lakes of Mecca and finds it even nice.
Her impression: "Election in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty".
B27 Sanitation: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mock.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and only ends at around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty sloppy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tanker.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved south at the beginning of the week, as planned, until the end of October.
It also praises the presence of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency entrances.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blockage of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again existing, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel on both sides of the B 27 from many times.
The exit through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says the deputy chief executive officer in charge of traffic management, Florian King.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege were searching and more familiar with their navi than the signage.
This led some trucks to grind in residential areas.
As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality called for a greater demand for the Mossessian measuring vehicle.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on site.
There's been a flash of two to three minutes already.
The fastest was on the move at 77 km in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has continued, however, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Look into the cards, businessmen don't want to be allowed to.
But that the B 27-sanitation has led to sales breaks, let anyone you ask see through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customers", i.e. for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at the Maier Motorhome, but also admits that of course "the running distance is missing".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already being threatened.
Not just him, but all the restaurants hit it hard.
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every Euro turnover.
The decline in sales is "over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "returned" its operation "in two years".
Half of his employees had to let go.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of it had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt, has responded to a question from Gohneger, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts where something like this was done more generously.
In all proceedings, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now pass less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
The fact that his regular clients come back after the end of the renovation work has no doubt about that.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, it's already brutal.
Laws are constantly being screwed up in the name of the fight against terrorism.
According to the latest attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable to the coalition partner", the Federal Minister of the Interior said in presenting his new security package.
You're not overdoing anybody.
Other, wider issues would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
However, as Minister of the Interior, he was at the conclusion of a "achieveable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière left a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, and highlighted: The fact that a new security authority is to take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to penalize sympathies for terrorist groups and to cut off jihadists with dual citizenship from the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not require anything, which the coalition partner has no chance anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have some of it in themselves: he plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees targeted at the country are supposed to have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally fragile.
Some also seem unbroken and leave questions open.
And on a number of points - for example, when it comes to the unequal treatment of those who have suffered - the question arises: what exactly does this have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Furthermore, given the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that were deeply occupied by people could not be excluded even in election times.
Internal security has become a major focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
First of all, there is a glaring dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about the collection of security-political ideas by some Union Ministers of the Interior, in which the head of the headquarters also demand a Burka ban and a withdrawal from the dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also working here on consonant tones.
He doesn't think anything about a departure from the double-pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It doesn't make sense to reopen it.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package on all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually "susceptible" for the coalition partner needs to show up first.
There's a lot in there that could cause disputes.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautiously the willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen's still coming through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets it is running around.
In the case of recall, there is a whirlwind around a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car maker can continue to show a boost in the course of the year, despite its many brands and several well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again burdened the overall sales, as reported by the company listed in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles with 449100 cars in July than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second largest market, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous month.
In the home market Germany almost one sixth of deliveries took place.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July, especially to two days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets "changed economic framework conditions" had held back purchases.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup in Turkey, the British vote had also affected the withdrawal from the EU, one speaker explained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas stores first escalated, there is also a minus to be found.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony still continues to shine through the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a decrease of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests using a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to be upgraded to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars does not have any negative effects.
There will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the vehicle has been refitted.
The automaker issues the customer a "guaranteed" certificate after the upgrade, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason for this is legal fineness.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that no deterioration will occur after the upgrade in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power and all vehicle type-approval related values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the upgrade, customers will come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid, in the interest of customers, any other damage which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, which could result in uncertainty as to the possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will in future require rich savers to pay penalties - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily money accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would have to "don't fear to pay for their sparse penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on current or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time now, he has kept EUR 40 million, which could be removed from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"These are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend every million €4,000."
He is now passing on the costs according to the polluter principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be much too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank manager.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavaria Cooperative Association stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes significant costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "not possible permanently in the business sector".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of up to three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that retail customers will have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, for which the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong".
A banker said that on Lake Tegern there is "a client who is somewhat richer equipped with assets".
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money for free.
Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "does not currently have any other banks known to calculate an outlay replacement for deposits by private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens to detract from investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love records.
Before you go to the comment section yesterday, to pass it under the pseudonym NotAllInsomniaMenMitlersAlterns with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are all foreseeable by age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy road in Soho, carry a modest gray suit and steal wildly before I stay, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly breaks into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of dates: two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (number of dates: eight men of middle age, one woman, probably around the 20) is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet with the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the Mediahpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are getting involved in buying back their old records.
People usually got away with the conversations I had around 1998 or 1999 from their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records," he says.
This would explain the boom to the followers of the revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be a kind of comfort to fill a void or the possession of material possessions," says Wez.
That's the way I'm a collector, and I think it's the way many people do.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" one employee flashes out of a pile of plates.
A April ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I am shooting through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophe aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-weighted, less music-weighted.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a bright audience when I go in.
There are pairs around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dries out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a show window buster than a wholesaler.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a in love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to be musting the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teen girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up, that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "plate art".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research has shown that YouGov's results are correct, they leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums out of consideration, at least in Soho.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street's record shops and leaves through records while avoiding the stark gaze of an uncanny 30-year-old false presenter who asks about the shoulders of no older men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically, Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in the case of a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the Calais authorities to destroy dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to take down 72 provisional shops where people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture, Calais, argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which present a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people "in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
The Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp was one of the places threatened by the low-rise, which is run for non-profit purposes and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum issues for the hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "was for these children a disaster, the youngest of which are eight years old."
The two relief agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to let himself be defeated.
"I keep watching the World Cup, stay confident and fight further," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn't have a explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar cane.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace the reasons for the debacle.
In October, Martin wanted to compete for the title at the World Time Championship in Qatar.
"I'm going to look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also counts for my position," wrote the three-time world road champion, who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54.5 km to Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund missed semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world ranking 32. from Metzingen missed through a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only pass through their attack once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British man Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic single semifinal.
Group increases to start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not report on Thursday.
Beam did not start with his offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up on player missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment.
The player Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The staff of the start-up, which has previously been based in Seattle, Washington, United States, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamedi reported.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video gaming activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by Amazon online dealer - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's lawn has to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are particularly effective in transferring tempo offenders.
For example, the future-oriented enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used to focus on accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement, the case data is transmitted in encrypted form via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be collected simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-speed condition, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with a trailer coupling.
In order not to be simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring plant, so that the wheels in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities too are lightning with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in the 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold picks up
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7-er rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, retaliating, line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth in this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back on them in the finals.
But independently of this, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This trap will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and allowed the attacks of GBs to blow off in fun.
It felt like you were running in bus for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co.. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau stepped over in the corner.
With another four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he transformed.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s generous handle stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-initiation and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouou presided over by other weak thank-yous of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The transformation brought a 29.0 until the break.
It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to do it.
That's the way it is.
GB carried out fundamental mid-term changes and closed the Fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Sea Insulators, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Vilame put the i-top with a further try in the last seconds.
The whistle ringed, Fiji's embraced and GB tickled devastatingly in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a short semifinal match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late thanksgiving by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the victory - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer to row win
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that wants to be called.
From the first rowing hit to the last, 220 hard hives that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two who sat on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was ally when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in two without a tax woman in succession, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th unmatched use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph to all.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who didn't know if he would survive that day at all than cancer was diagnosed with him 30 months ago.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, it spreads out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that it was treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, could begin what the interruption kept to a minimum, if in such circumstances this is at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than usual and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just keeps repeating how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get caught.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't going to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, get out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time off for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary for clarity provided
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Frankish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
It was called in the original tone some time ago in a contribution by Bayerische Rundfunk.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia recognized the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "as exemplary throughout Bavaria".
All of this is backed by Rupert Göller, who was an employee for 31 years, of whom 28 years was the managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach are member municipalities.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water watch in 1985 and had already been appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water management construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, the calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency deployments on weekends," said the chairman.
Its outstanding events included the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the high-containers (1999), the renewal of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There had been no halt and innovations had been repeated because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
He referred to the construction of wells and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights from his point of view.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment was the breach of pipes on the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it was necessary to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter, who takes over from Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicals have made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease had been recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, had made good progress and now studied privately in New York, where there were the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that lies behind two years when I sang on the Milaner Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) around 10.45 a.m. on Friday and fatally injured her.
"The man called us and said he shot his life mate," said a police officer.
The persecutor is on the run, after him is public.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, burning and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a smooth.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, says the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988 and died in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not initially want to make any information about the Tathergang or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing delicacy."
"That's all we're saying at the moment," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eye-witnesses, a Special Use Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Lighting view for German steel industry
The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from green electricity support are from the table.
The release of the renewable energy bill from the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry remained, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutscher Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel manufacturers, using gases from the furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption, to cash out.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a agreement of principle with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel plants are replaced will an EEG-payment of 20 percent fall.
But these too are not collected in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of its own electricity.
The status quo of the current scheme is thus largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Stahl is the future', this is a first step."
"Others have to follow."
"Even in the context of the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets have to be balanced," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive steel on the world market due to the weakening domestic demand.
European producers propose price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
During this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties have an effect on imports steel, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened up.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry primer Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six per cent less crude steel than in the previous month, as reported by the Economic Association of Steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two per cent lower than in the previous year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output.
community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl, she was in school choir, in teaching school she attended music and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and overall more alive," she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes hacklers.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are dissolved at an age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To meet and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coexistence".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly ask for their lungs do not get out of the box as quickly as they do in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at an age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Seniors' Organisations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, explains it.
Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who are ill draw attention to long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
To concentrate at the same time on your own voice and on a specified rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice that way, not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, meaning Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has a little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear you when a sound goes next to it?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesial choir can go directly to the church or to the church principal.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help in searching the Internet.
If you want to sing, if you want to join a choir, you might want to talk to hackers.
Singing the soul does well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to the screams of young animals
Biologists in Hanover investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mauen did not leave the males cold either - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can see the rate of excitation of cat babies at the mouth of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to the sounds of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Hannover Medical University (MHH) found out.
Kater also reacts to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miauen of fewer and strongly excited young animals for males are either not perceptible or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitchen scream differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the MHH animal husbandry.
They were played for the first time by little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited cats who were also raised.
Despite the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All the females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call of the much more excited cats played.
This ability may be innate or develop with the sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup, an important football game takes place in Turkey.
The official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced in front of the duel of the archevals between Beveckas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya.
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the crash attempt in July, the government claimed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not apply, however, to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup.
Even before football is not stopped.
The prosecutor's office issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Consequently, the now American Sucre is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the 90-day derogation initially applies until October, it does not affect the lives of most Turkishs.
On Wednesday, Erdogan declared the night's "democracy growth" in public places throughout the country to be over.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Bevavas do not traditionally count among the friends of the president.
What unites the greatness of the Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or surveillance.
With Cup winner "Gala" it will especially arrive again on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneer demonstrated his sporting value in the season that ended: With 17 goals and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a satisfactory conclusion for the record champion.
After the first round K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also left the Europa League early.
==References====External links==
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did this and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Bevavas, the year of the game was better.
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as a Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, Gomez, who was under contract at AC Florenz and had only been loaned to Bevellas after the coup, announced that he would not return after his EM holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the specialist magazine "Kicker" quoted Club Manager Fikret Orman.
For this purpose, however, the stormer would have to be prepared to refrain from about a third of its estimated EUR 7.5 million annual declaration, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been detained twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other translated athletics offenders can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who, after a doping lock-out, had accused her right to take off shortly before the games, was mercilessly kicked out and strung out at her start (100 meters breast).
It offered itself a crooked scenery: With a smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that they weren't going to pick up gold, the audience broke out into a cheerstorm.
However, there are still many more athletes who, despite the doping process, will start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been detained twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion have even been running faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-strap/Jamaya): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time World Champion had to sit a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown to be taking Oxycodon.
She had had severe toothaches after surgery, defended herself the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner of 2012, the World Champion of 2013 and the European Champion of 2010 to 2016 were tested positively for the prohibited stimulation of methyl hexanamin.
Perkovic contested the scientific intake and was detained for six months.
The four largest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m-strap/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and was locked down for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible for expensive Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): hardly any athlete was able to win so many medals afterwards.
So Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later, after finding testosterone doping at him.
The 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver 2004 for steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a judgment of the International Sport Court (CAS).
At 80.04 m he is ranked two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world recorder and gold favourite was only tested positively in May, but still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the use of a banned food supplement, the blockade of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and already ran off on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, on Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she could have left it again.
Her home trip planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, two bombs were first exploded in an outing district on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosions went up, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the early morning by Phuket.
At the detonation near the popular beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the southeastern coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the blast rate had gone into the air in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police territory.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast required several injured.
One goes out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee on Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - probably, however, the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the southern part of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said one speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities would have received classified information on imminent attacks in the southern part of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and location.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police pointed out to their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, unnecessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence even in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improvement of the economic situation and tourism.
The military unit, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself beneficial to having restored the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, even the military has not succeeded in getting to grips with the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people had also been killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack on the country's younger history.
The right-wing "identity movement" has come into the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitary Movement' indications of efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Head of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants are defamed from Islamic faith or from the Middle East in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a grouping of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multiculti-wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identities".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppie music.
The ordinary Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
That's not a messy ad for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to emotionally appeal to people.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently there had been reports from several federal states on contacts between "identities" and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important to know whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction of purpose by certain persons who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognisable.
With regard to the clear increase in legal-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are planning attacks on asylum seekers, on refugee homes or on attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable.
The previous groups were formed at regional level or on social networks.
Concernedly, Maasten expressed that many attacks went on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
This is worrying.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum housing were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing followers.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or who, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internethit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swims so slowly that he was not seen in the TV pictures at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks Habte then became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old with a delay of 48 seconds finished his lead and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just sporting figure who attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming club.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly turned around.
Some media called him "the robel of the whale".
The English Boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him, based on a bouncy belly.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, it didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to perform alone in a predecessor over 100 metres of freestyle.
Frenetisch was fired by Moussambani at the time.
The 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never gone such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store on the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Gerets rhyme had left her business on Monday at around 5:30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned at 8.15 a.m. the next morning, approximately 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat as tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there's nothing going on with the US president's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he wouldn't mind: "Finally, it will either work, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If, at the end of the day, it's not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, that's all right, Trump said.
He named the US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger appears to be great.
The post is also planning to sell their electric vehicle Street Scooter.
The Group intends to start trading with the carrier shortly.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year on the free car market as well.
"We want to start selling to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether they are to sell their self-developed street scooters with letters and parcels to other companies.
Post CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, such as by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly.
In the postal manufacturing the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and level in the long term a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management decreases after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become all the more uncertain, the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures again and the resignation of the management, the global number five of the industry is ahead of a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The Management Board took over Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1st, the company announced.
He is to be officially appointed to the function of a CEO until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to call a company speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will be head of the market research company in the future is still unclear.
It was stated in investors' circles on Friday that the shareholders had, last but not least, been disappointed by the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Spitze since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it was said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures each shareholder becomes at some point restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, that would also be the case with the Dannts," he said.
The company could not have stopped its loss business even in the second quarter of 2016, after having made cuts in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter have, in particular, affected the company's reduced value given its difficult economic situation.
The EUR 139 million corporate depreciation required by the Consumer Experience business unit caused the Group to lose EUR 148.2 million under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhorn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident on a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to avoid a hit-and-run truck that was partly on the reverse lane.
The bus came off the street to the right and slipped into a trench, as a spokesman from the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department released the inmates.
Six life-saving cars and one emergency medical car came to the accident site on Landstraße 2.
The unharmed travellers were taken back from a bus line to the Krumhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the waste water plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3,44 euros instead of 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (up from 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (up from 2,18 euros).
At the Azendorf plant, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that under-coverage for these waste water plants occurs.
The Kasendorf market was obliged, on legal grounds, to operate the plants on a cost-effective basis.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the wallet.
The rise in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.
As Administrative Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water treatment plants of the market municipality was necessary.
For the period October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The significant increase in charges was due to the relatively small facilities in all three wastewater plants with a very low waste water incidence, which ranged from 6800 to 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low basis of distribution, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants was slightly declining.
In addition, in the previous calculation period all three plants had, not least due to their age, considerable renovation and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkohl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp were almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the waste water plant in Azendorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation plant due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveying systems had to be completely overrun and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to comply with water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of a small waste water impact in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance "perfectly pass through".
In addition to Schmidt, the market community had been spared major maintenance costs for the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the said plants will remain precarious in the long run, especially since the waste water treatment plant of Friesenbachtal cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are defiant facilities.
Bulgaria book inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first one over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
Average annual inflation in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% measured according to the CPI.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following consumer goods groups was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is an anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bordering on absurdity.
You can turn into an pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, feature-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misdeeds come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism, in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, wrong teeth and thinned cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversys pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.
Others rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets about the photos were widely distributed, wrote that the filter was "injuring and, to a lesser extent, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the devalued extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapcats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a staff manager who focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her, said that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I'm wondering if they need more users like us to say it's not OK."
Military leadership falsifying ISIS intelligence information, establishes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congress Committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The Central Command, in a short time, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Communicational information, which was typically necked by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military conquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to put down the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after it was played out that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed information while the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations by Centcom reports are under way by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the Senior Democratic in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of news reports", damaged morals among analysts and "gives too little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of intervention by the White House by the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, who were admitted after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press speaker, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports, while the Inspector General's investigations were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how far President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of secret information about the Islamic state reminds us of disputes more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the government under George W. Bush at that time, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisaged only a small crew in Iraq and little time had to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker found, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the state of war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India, which the Americans won at 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the same group as the British in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two in their group of six teams will be the first and second place each.
The first place will take the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that lead the other group.
However the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three, she had a hockey player in her hands (both older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things around for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to tear the row completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and limped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to make a goal in each of the previous games.
She's running.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the results of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
No matter where you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging season between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is handed from the armbrush to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a female warm-up with dimples, could well have been under these well-known names, sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a coward.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I modestly make arguments for my particular lover, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many of the people I had asked didn't know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medal this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside scarring, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonic shaking of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of turns and diving, which unites two types of sport, essentially.
The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "spray board."
Stunning winners jump onto a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (throws, hedges, and saltos) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Two and a half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will fight each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopeers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only pursue the target line or the starting wall, but also another deceptive goal in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel when I watch these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
Women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the aggressor and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments recently predict - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to ring in the air.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent government resistance.
Witnesses say that ten protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shootings.
Is Ethiopia just collapsing?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
The government's response was merciless according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed ten unarmed demonstrators.
Videos of the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security personnel beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much western assistance.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led to repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the vulture grip in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a largely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this thorny, controversial line took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, who have been more or less forced to use the storms in recent years, could use and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of boiling under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services have improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet procedures that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mostly from Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's what's changing.
"We are coordinating under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which make up around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's Prime Minister for Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly fond of seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Agents to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected for relatively opaque reasons in order to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently dishonored by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, although it was less than in the past months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for her visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new shuttle train, as well as for her measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But this has obviously not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal regret.
And she takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharian city, and the hatred of Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gravel migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been meant seriously by the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensiblely with the American public.
It also brings his colleagues who try to protect him during an eventful phase into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After he had made the indication at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know.
The last storm of criticism is coming down on Mr. Trump as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he made a strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared "Of course I meant sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received from his fans, how they arrive, and then if necessary "clear" depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone of the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more fragile tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading tour in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But as he is increasingly focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republics try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around and being biased against him on every of his words.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once out of the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bad café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were pushed away.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is changing, then it's also a new invention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer asked him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of information.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns like capers and salted onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady current on old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also pushed away by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After closing the verb, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the verb I liked about coffee and culture," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Ice coffee on that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same.
"I came around after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything ball with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he didn't care that the soap business took the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go ahead with their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he was planning to exhibit it soon, so his new neighbours felt welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like returning home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a low level for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de liver gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, cordless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbreads, this pair found fit for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.
"Many foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinste.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" marks the ways with which the country was about to be no longer the land of slums.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe said, "Why did he and his wife want to write about it."
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food, such as breads and cashrolls, became basic food, which cashrolls as "a wonderful way to re-use food residues," noted brickman, as chefs could hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the centre of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out as a calorie rich and nourishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
The brickman goes on to say, "It was surreal."
Strawberry butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
Like never before or since, budget managers - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have been driving the country's eating habits that way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "house politicians" and the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals to justice.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Cuch-Essen attitude, are tasty.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most consolingly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said brickman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple indicated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
A brick man remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windshield incident.
After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumber-end, President Roosevelt at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said brickman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes to send a name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each submerged a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got a look three times.
Like a can-do bulldozer, he said to his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a Assad bombing attack.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the picture newspaper, saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at stake to draw people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But as heroes he has never seen himself, according to the picture, "For me this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average distance of 1,220 metres.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seals at this maximum speed.
However, this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolution biologist long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, and in the end, they live in the ice creams above the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
Their slow pace measured them when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still yield: researchers found the remains of a seals in the stomach of an animal, another had swallowed the jawbones of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream tree and search for cadavers that dry down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen from the North Atlantic by-catch from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres were measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens cores of the shark with the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, on the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments, which is expected to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks in their lens core, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed a age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to the sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks are obviously able to grow for at least one and a half centuries.
This too should be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methuses live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, was also caught in front of Alaska by a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck.
Because of the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal heats up.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of an elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on construction issues.
With ease, the Board took note of the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the issues of land, parking and development have been clarified and applications for surveying have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Extension Section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipality council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and poor elderly alike.
As it was said, building owners can immediately report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots during its September session.
In order also to meet requests for the relocation of other commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the land use plan in sub-areas only created in spring of this year.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, for example, the already designated commercial area is extended by two plots towards Statestraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main is therefore in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg the best chance to attract new jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW's Competence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London through financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU pass has been approved by the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced the relocation of jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the head office of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA European Insurance Supervisory Board and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg, though home to a large fund industry, is also worse off than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also scored with readily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it's not that easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer says.
At Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate were also 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of company consulting Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg is in 19th place, Dublin is in 33rd place and Paris is in 37th place.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors", the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
The forces also speak of this: In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015; in Frankfurt, it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from compensation of $200 million for the violation of two Merck's patents related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the Meinide and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, US Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to a discharge of the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead's market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck accused each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say that they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have regained complete control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now passing through the city after the extraction of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They released over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Reuters Military Councillor, who was associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we're just doing clean-up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015, which gave an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the foreign ministry.
Clinton's vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers, as a reason for his refusal, indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities.
"They are on the train," said Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business attitudes and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already fallen to the topic and released on Friday a video on the Internet asking senior Republican Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate has its seat here, called on Trump to meet to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax review of the IRS and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that it only earned USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton's dividends and income of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzanian elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from walking in settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, intensified its promotion along with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvests without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we were able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared off, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body in a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When lit, the condom pops up with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A breath quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who blows a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk building on St. Goar River
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of commercial operators are accepted with kiss hand - but the retail trade in the core city in particular is considered to be clearly viable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for a new ski shop on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new business drivers, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director breaks down Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had told us that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election, as it would have "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him" as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by this event.
That's very embarrassing.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered quite a great resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "missed" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"You're ashamed," said another post, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident a "accident" and "excused" at Lanzmann," reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel did not include in the Quick Election List," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman at the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to dissipate the students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their regret about the plans.
According to the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffitis against provisional President Michel Temer on the walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went mass on the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to withdraw her.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
With the abolition of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent a year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan anticipates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness Search: Striking the Beverages Market in Forest Browsing
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the drinks market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the supervision of a gun of fire, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces demanded from the employees of the beverage market the issuance of cash and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
The police won't tell us how much money was spent.
The perpetrators are said to be between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have turned towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled from the gravel park with the silver car, located opposite the parking entrance, possibly towards B 256 (slader ring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the incident (at 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery is to report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
Eight nice and happy days the children and young people of the social pedagogic day group/social group work of the children's protection association Nagold with their guardians at their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
At Hardtwäldle's quiet leisure home, the lively group was incarcerated during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third excursion took to Pforzheim.
At the Celt Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary were spoiled by children and caretakers with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronn Pfännle, Isselhauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops it was beaten, beautiful gems made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure activities were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "colored evening".
On the day of the return journey, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were traveling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time until the next romwall ride of all ministers in two years, the St. Anna Supreme Minister's round has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage targets were examined and the decision was finally made for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the door of Mercy at Freiburg's Münster.
16 Minis from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
In the evening before, the pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim cross and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage path from the Münster was taken.
The individual daily tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writings each morning and evening.
But also on the way, the minis made rest on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again in order to sing together a song made up of a special pilgrim book.
For the nights each parishes of the local parishes were available.
On the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage after St. Peter, which was the busiest route, had to descend about 500 metres above sea level in the event of a swinging heat and then climb again again.
The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bath tub in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim's day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage in Freiburg.
The Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the later afternoon, visually relieved and happy, passing through the door of mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Ministers of Cooperator Markus Obert, who arrived at the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was the time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British gold rings for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner broke into fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The young boy made the legend proud when he stormed home to bring a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place in March at the World Railway Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the lap that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Sea countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his round, he was almost back, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.
A change in strategy made a large part of the transformation, where Hinders drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy looked forward to his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he fell on the track deliberately.
He withdrew this statement later, and there was no objection from England's rival.
There was no such problem with such a superior victory this time.
He said, "It feels like it's with all the GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away with so many world titles so badly that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expects us to be successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the field of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny - who is 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born).
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will participate next in the sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the finish.
The world record won in London Gold in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the contestant, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had been fighting yesterday with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trutt, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the mid-term of the Olympic Games and bring a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas played in the background, so the technical director Shane Sutton resigned in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the Velodrome competition, it looks like the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland smelter due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as announced by the supplier energy company.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Meltserei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly because of the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting plant," the company informed.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual balance of $187 million in "Awaiting a Termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant" did not affect.
The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November of this year, even if it is still guilty of explaining why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland Melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in [power market] demand.
And for us, as a power generator, that wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's problems as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliche act almost every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?") with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit in a broadcast place at 8 a.m., but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to have beaten her about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were there to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size similar to a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertisement).
The unveiling of his cover star is expected to be so longing that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities that model" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it all comes to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, Victoria's former secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the humility seems to go past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, it is a supermodel.
She's working for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she can be seen on Reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy people are rejected annually by the municipal justice centres, while the industry is addressing the impact of further cuts in funding on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence, and those who do not have the means to deregulate wrongly and the like - are already dismissed in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Community Law Centres of Queenland James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned down every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the Federal Government to cancel.
"Queensland Municipal Law Centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be denied important services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with impregnable and distressing debts, families who go through divisions, workers who were wrongly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities, and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump indicted election campaign after employees allegedly pulled the gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a gun to an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right finger on the pull, and rammed the race in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"We don't have to fire weapons to do damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges are appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and would not incite him to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
No response was received to calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Swerin: Survey before Country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses were recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule slightly further, this is not possible according to the Berlin survey values.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good opportunities to continue to represent the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23%.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4%) and the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Landtag at 19 percent.
Despite the slight losses, the Greens are relegating to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be present at the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD was only 23 per cent (election in 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17,6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives by 14 percent.
With 5 percent the FDP could hope to return, while the pirates would miss the entrance in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come from the stone age of the Internet.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "Office in Western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for standards at that time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The prize was fairly proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.
No one could imagine in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all over the world is for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, including Samsung and Apple alone 555 million pieces.
Worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-run business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone an entire industry has been created.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, at that time Apple Chief Steve announced jobs on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communications machine to easily use everything via a touch screen.
Apple's victory started, and today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look at it.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in charge of personnel at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we were doing a great deal of work to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new teaching posts, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great for Heathrows.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blow ourselves on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK as a whole.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been selected as the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years to the T2, built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runs.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass advertising blocking, a "catz and mouse game" is the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post informing users that they could update their filters in the program to reblock ads on the social network.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising ads to make it difficult to detect ad blocks about which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding community has been underway since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been fighting is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers worldwide; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has apart from ad blockers on desktop PCs, because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, one speaker reported.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so Facebook appears to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," one Facebook speaker said in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Overrun a woman in the event of suicide on the Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman was overrun in the early morning hours on Thursday in case of a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some of them have still not been identified, said the police, who invite them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway at night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was released after crossing and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the police officer -- who responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had soil-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet was slowly turning.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once likely habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans drowned and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from Colorado Avalanche as coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion.
During the summer I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike off
The wage struggles for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are holding a new round of talks, says negotiators.
Strikes against the field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year in order to deal with the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced its rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space to get through the market downturn.
For its part, Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-connection with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been reinforced by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the cluster of stars of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster and what the rotation periods are related to the planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which came about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning faster now.
These mature stars emit large amounts of starwinds at peak rotation rates.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
As the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Marines (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees he created several milestones since 2005.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted into the fame hall of baseball.
For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside of the square.
In 2009, the Superstar admitted to "ESPN" that they had taken prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was detained for 211 games in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have received performance-promoting funds for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could have even done me a favor for 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
His farewell days don't go silent either.
While many baseball legends once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often sat on the bench.
"My job doesn't include farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," exclaimed Yankee's coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy talks from fans of the Yankee Archeval Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Catched: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases became known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, a 3000 metre inhibitor Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - right before the start of the already critically-acclaimed athletics competitions, these news comes to an end.
In Chen, the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide was shown last Sunday to be used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sport Court of CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finals over 100 m of butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have taken part in the proceedings over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and for a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", quoted Xinhua in a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the message about the positive test at Danekova came through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", this is "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-samples should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borissow, spoke immediately with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping loading nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively, like his brother Tomasz, three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both deny taking, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before starting the athletics, the case of Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.
The world association IAAF had banned the complete Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, even the lauferation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent conflicts between the athletes.
The Frenchman, Camille Lacourt, attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang hard.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 metres freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and respect for doping fraud," he said.
Sun had been tested positive for trimetazide at the 2014 Chinese championships, but had only to sit a three-month lock.
Data Kluu: So perfide extort hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey of malware defence specialists, malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, partly several times victims of an attack using expresser software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of Ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to re-use the attacked systems and data.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful, the potential ransom is much higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of malware software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send ads.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the expressors.
In order to get the end-cryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage will be higher if a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses from Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of the halt in operation.
The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And when private individuals are redeemed from payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to deal hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a Ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual expressers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The expressers then search for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the forums in the ground, buy the set from one criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Probably, the criminals then charge spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey rely on being able to defend Ransomware by using file backups and scanner software.
As such, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
As a result, the damage potential depending on the type of data is many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on entirely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could become a topic in Industry 4.0 as well.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the bottom, it doesn't seem to be narrow in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off slightly.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
There is not only a suitcase room of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the back seat can be folded up like cinema armchairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering might be a little more direct.
The equipment does not reveal any wishes in the top version "Executive" tested.
The security systems include the City Notbram Assistant (worked up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates them because it evaluates many obstacles as "next objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and dries the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are below the armrest and are therefore a bit understandable to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don't want to invest so much, you'll get the fuel from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: falls on the passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the downfall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability could only be assumed in the event of dangers typical of air transport (see: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken his knee at the time of the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers receive money after their trip only if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously affected by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey leave.
She spent almost the whole holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip had been lacking - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the applicants left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, like the verdict.
No impurities were found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - is a general risk to life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to be prudent and determined to respond at the same time to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, however, this would increase security and also strengthen the public's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the Bundestag elections in 2017.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle four-digit order over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance will be improved, the law of arms will be introduced in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much discussed silence for doctors should be respected according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wanted to find solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with a view to psychological incidents.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To track criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was a face-to-face for the sharps in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Freitag).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality.
It considers a general ban on full circulation to be problematic under constitutional law.
You can't prohibit everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green-Chéfin Simone Peter suggested to the minister that he want to simulate action and ability to act with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left Party Chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotted sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring people in this country any more security".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It stands regularly on the bypass road - here a picture from November.
But this should change: the right-wing mark should be extended.
This is a good news for all drivers who stand in the traffic jam every evening on the surrounding road when driving via the motorway (A 43).
The national road construction operation will extend the right-wing track by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th/17th August) between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Motorists can then thread directly from the Hammer Street to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up more early, improving the overall run-up on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the transporter is particularly annoying for the motorists between 5 and 7 p.m.
On working days, the backrest reaches the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
For reasons, the needlehole on the B 51 is just before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here the traffic is guided only one way over the motorway bridge.
The second trail had to be rebuilt about one and a half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy duty traffic in particular.
How long will this congestion and the associated work-day congestion last, cannot be said by the competent national farm.
However, it can be expected with years: the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the legal trail, the country holding has deliberately selected the weaker time in school holidays because of disability.
The traffic is passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday one-way.
Intercultural Trip: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an introduction to the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Nima association, 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, and did not speak German.
Thanks to choreographies, scenes and video animations, they could still follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Jungen Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical speech mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increasing numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of snowfall: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star schnuppen-Guckern in southwest Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night had been ill-suited for observing the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The constellations are Persians, one of the fastest in the world at 216,000 kilometres per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips Against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you wake up for hours, in the morning you don't think about sleep much before the alarm clock.
That's anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel that their sleep is frequent or permanent.
What about sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood below, however, is insomnia, i.e. sleep disorder and sleep disorder.
Sleeping through it is precisely what many people feel is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as drugs, can be involved.
Sleep disorder is a common expression of another disease.
"Very early wake-up is especially common in depression," Weess says.
And it may be that different factors are interrelated.
For example, if you have a disc incident, you may be ill, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to grind over everyday problems and care, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should a doctor be given sleep disorder?
If you do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by day, you should go to a doctor.
The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten down, tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to identify its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks - are questioned.
There is hardly any dropout of sleeping doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Sleep Medicine at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleeping problems you should first contact the home doctor, Weess advises.
He can check if the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to bed, and what's going on?
For example, doctors are advised to study in the dormitory laboratory in snores with respirators, in sick day fatigue, in sleep walkers, or if one does not find the cause of sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep for lunch, please," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglass, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping endings.
How can the problem be tackled?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts: Regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is completely not conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke via Facebook about the disappointing cutting off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first won gold at the Doha Shortway World Championships, simultaneously setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in a protective position via Facebook against his ex-team colleagues who are critical.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000€ premium and a jungle king 150,000€ no one should wonder about the missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night.
The swimming sports promotion system was poor, while the doping controls were very good.
We cannot therefore compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate it on the doping issue.
"I'm not saying the controls are to be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly the way it should be with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain time before the World Cup/OS is not allowed to take part," demands the election-hamburger, who is now running an ice-calibre.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian officials of the Düsseldorf Police succeeded in arresting two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the Düsseldorf airport again recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year and had committed them in a community, part-time and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the criminal commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically entered Germany to commit crimes.
They had earned a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime still a rest of the stone walls: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that at first sight, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
Someone sprayed "hateful!" to the facade of a gray house.
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trend district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been portrayed in the last few weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin-based Internal Senator Henkel has been in favour of a harsh approach by the police against the project, calling the area "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the premises on the ground floor, the Kadtersmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
In the meantime, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of unknown houseowners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the premises had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the guise of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk like Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiesz since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly embarrassed by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who most wanted police protection from vandalizing lefts.
The graves opened by the inner senator and the police between housekeepers and their neighbours do not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Households and their housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße, very close to the Rigar.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under great police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and, in part, are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR and former housekeepers now share their choice with them.
This is also noticeable in the case of rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized on cast-in discs or freshly painted facades, which have been cast out with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers according to statistics.
Most of the offences involve damage to property, which tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no doubt.
As for the acts of violence, she is appalling: the people in 94 are their neighbors, and they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigar.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has consciously moved to Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the street is still taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former building blocks that push the old inhabitants away.
"These are, after all, condominiums that aren't of interest to many people here - people who aren't so well served here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of power and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
For those who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiesz.
Anyone who pulls in should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuskle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact in matters of integration and organiser.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuskle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschel is now there, the laying wool milk, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mocking than others - had targeted the number of areas of activity desired, than the administration wanted to put the job out.
An administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a laying of wool milk.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuskle.
Above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent term for three years.
"It was high time," says Regina Customer, "that Annika Deuskle supports honorary and general actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The cost of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Land Council Office to the local authority and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been a very difficult one for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, if you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.
Therefore, communal dwellings must be explored, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it's not just with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuskle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina Customer.
Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy".
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administrative and volunteer staff are also jumping in here.
It was crucial that the refugees felt that they were wanted and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of proceedings was a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it is just going to take a while and that they can bridge time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, customer honestly says, "people with nothing at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: Do the two, after recent events, fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No", Regine customer clearly says, "what some naïve might call it." A residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also a topic for refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would bring them completely to trial.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, senior and volunteer officials must keep an eye on activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
This question is clearly answered, and politics is afraid of it.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we could go yet," says Annika Deuskle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already used to properly integrate the previous people.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruder with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg at around 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and struck the unhappiness into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoods.
They fled to downtown.
The police deployed several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter.
The plot went unsatisfied.
The unknown persons may have been found near the apartment or when they fled.
