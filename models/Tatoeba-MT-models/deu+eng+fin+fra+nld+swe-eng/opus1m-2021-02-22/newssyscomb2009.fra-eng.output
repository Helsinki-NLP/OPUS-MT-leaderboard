Triomphe of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the anticipated parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the political stage at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; in particular for the popular party, which triggered the advance elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
Electors obviously punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were expressed regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the party's extraordinary board of directors.
Such a development would primarily facilitate the way forward towards the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Frees (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists simultaneously expressed the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and fell from the third in fifth position to the third among the Austrian political parties.
Clearly, no other party has reached the limit of four percent and has access to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at Risk of Cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegally picking cockroaches in India could not be resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said it would result in a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister declared him today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, by way of talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"The problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the judgement to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be thanked," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", mentioned the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," indicated Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt," he said.
The Minister asked if he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he only found.
A Czech to arbitrate the struggle for the seabed
It is approaching a wall electronic map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The egg belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosousso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the director of the division, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete from time to time.
The firmness at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known to date, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A Larger Ground than Land
The Literal States have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they actually used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the continental shelf is considered to be the portion of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific/technical documentation based on many prospecting and expensive metrisis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
To date, the Committee has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," says Mikulka.
Australia's success, the first to have greatly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission awarded last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries are going to submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean bottom, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no State has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is conferred by an international treaty institution.
"Nevertheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Mikulka, exaggerating that "his areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states in the former bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization Interoceanmetal.
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a number of other states, it obtained the status of the so-called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area forecasted by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a rich layer of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
It recalls a little potato, or rather, with some imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never switched to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both the Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as the logistics experts from the Technical Hilfwerk were at the scene of the liberation.
As the minister's spokesman communicated on Monday evening, German forces were finally not required, as hostages who had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a force release.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it into the field as a support force.
"Unfortunately, this has not happened until then," said a spokesman from the Federal Interior Ministry.
The aggressors had taken away in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their kidnapping in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" magazine, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are expected to take off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Chamber of Representatives refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed in a small way to secure the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was falling into the abyss.
With 227 votes against, 206 votes in favour, the United States House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan in favour of the government's financial markets.
Despite all the United States President George W. Bush's calls and politicians in charge of both parties, the program that was supposed to curb the financial market chaos did not achieve the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the partisans had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called for a favourable vote on the plan, although it was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones had more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could cappotify.
He went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
As for bookings for the next few months according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the German travel thirst remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With respect to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's survey, increasing numbers of reservations are already dominant in the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have increased to about 11 percent compared to 2007, with the VDR.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyses the booking data for 1200 travel agencies on a monthly basis and provides estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, stated the VDR.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one Third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are highly requested, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individual organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months have also been very strong so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans undertaking a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in sticky liters and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to designer.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made Tyrol costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrol costume seems to achieve its objective.
As a tourist from the beer festival and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wears a tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one seems to be inflated or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my tyrolian costume harvests a few bits of strange eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian makes me notice that I would have badly attached my apron: "to the left means free, to the virgin, to the right boxed, to the back widow."
Disconcertingly, I'm tripping my back loop to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others don't get so bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes their naked rear-train without being invited.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with a "oooooo" lying down.
He tells me all this after he was relieved of the cup he used to drink.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a trash.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pissers."
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening, rescuer ribs run to the party square and have to deal with the poor drinkers.
Nurses intervene rather in a riot - always by four, they drag their civier covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most of the visitors to the beer festival: we go empty there, we get back full.
Those who are in the coffin of the crooked under the bough are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," shouts one of the rescuers in response to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A pedestrian aged 63, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon in town.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released on bail since then.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its backcountry.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps may be, from Asia, one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is set to ride at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its corners, like some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket shop, we have no more doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and the most famous land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its area around, caused by the freezing borders of the Cold War, is complete.
. The British and the Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, she has fallen slowly into ruin, engulfed in the mounds of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serve to underline the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around, caused by the freezing borders of the Froid War
Now is the time for a new engagement policy.
The Turkish Government has outstanding relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went on a bed-car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKS Suât Kinglioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built commercial centers and numerous pastries in which middle-class managers - men's and women's - meet for morning business.
Suat Kinklioglu could have been a right-wing centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie, and he's even got a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from behind the country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with both.
She was supposed to do both.
"But, here's the moment, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?".
"Turkey" he said "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to speak, have heartily raised me: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, therefore, is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to be drawing a Europe that travels metaphorically on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha railway station, after another night without sleep, I thought of these two Germans, Mr. Ritter and Mr.Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey was named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already taken part in his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the under 21 years, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all here in music.
So sing!"
Its wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Either the musical standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be appointed a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the deceases from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years, I have seen more than 100 of her concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me and, some times, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his opinion, "focused only on certain people".
A lot of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950 while he was doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
This is what came from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time he finished a PhD thesis on British plastics industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the flamenco and life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second assault on Honda's super-sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
Adds to this a few refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
A evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz is aesthetically similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it must be stressed that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation of the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter period of time than that of other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Especially in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continental, with more or less one million cars sold in six years represents second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it considered selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 jazz since 2002, representing 6.7 per cent of Honda sales in Spain.
Spanish affiliates hope to sell 2,000 jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, brand leaders hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 metres long - on which the company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Based on markets and estimates from the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled to take place in the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimetres in addition), its width is 1.69 metres (two centimetres in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 metres.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres in addition to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that gave access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 t/min and 114 Nm torque at 4.900 t/min.
This propellant - which on previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous driver, who on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
Nissan has this time been inspired by nature, especially bees, to advance the development of accident prevention technologies.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will enable branded vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that is very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important are bee-composed eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is called a laser locater (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles over a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movement of a bee and immediately change direction by refurbishing its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Movement and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor in diagonals; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it, and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device only needs to process information and act according to this data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of pre-manoeuvring, that is why it can function continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This is the first because of the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury, apart from having a lot of cash to plan, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to avoid the Americans getting into mortgages with the solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
That's to say 'The Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The lugure aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think on several occasions if it's the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but not detailed information.
It's more like a game for teenagers.
¿What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a home
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his round table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome to a sharp decline in its stock market.
One week after a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common shares at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The selected price is 19 per cent lower than the accounting value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities to ensure a return of 10% and with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's action lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," said Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "we assumed that the participation would consist entirely of ordinary actions.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47 for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, one speaker from the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August Morgan has "lowly" reduced its balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate melt half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was flying away.
This cost returned on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Reflect the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two out-of-voting polls and a countdown from a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" victory, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution was overwhelmingly triumphant," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in a calm manner according to the Organization of American States' (OAS) observation mission, focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the "planning of development" of a country mainly living from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its migrants.
With Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and set a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services, which the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the enthroners of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were returned this Monday afternoon healthy and left in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at around 15:30 on a special plane at the Al-Maza military base, which was built at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the raveners," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been captivated from one cache to another by 35 unknown deer.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, deployed on two helicopters, had launched the assault the night just before dawn.
"There was an exchange of shots, and half of the predators were killed, the others fleeing," said this officer who demanded anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Franco Frattini, head of Italian diplomacy, spoke of Belgrade, where he found himself, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to professionalism and the efficiency of our people's secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before that, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol, on which the predators were located, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which this movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and the current election campaign is taking place.
So much the better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the misery of small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national, hungry historic sites?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he is neglecting his monuments and his heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteer people grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under monceaux of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of the bank Fortis
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in a situation of distress due to the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalising it. The three countries bear, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution which also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also by calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition authority.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been taking place for more than a year, is for the bank Fortis. In some ways, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, first and foremost, the insurance activities that it acquired last year from the Dutch company ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares started a vertigo fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let it go bankrupt.
Just Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the Group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the over-atlantic uncertainty, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of causing the decline in Fortis shares.
Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as new director general.
The financial institution was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information concerning prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
"This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it will be to entrust a fox to a fox," said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug requirements at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the capital insured in the event of injury, on the state of health of the client who is present, and if they believe that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they became aware of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he can easily obtain from pharmacies, data on the purchase of medicines from the person within the last 18 months. From this, the program itself determines the illness of the person and the state of health of the person.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do with the insurer except paper drive. However, minor problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat shocks, but can also be effective against depression.
This is considered by insurers to be a worsening risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must request the patient's permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
In recent years, some companies have also been working on the results of laboratory analyses, linking them to data on drug use, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the supervisory circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he has developed even more ahead of his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and ultimately, the chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The Marseilles global menu
The European Union and India double their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India, where the main issue will be nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not overemphasize this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of around 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and, on the other, New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this subject was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the fact that a global market would have to be reached at the climate conference next year and that greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The head of State of India is now visiting the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Book Fair, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Fair for the Book of Frankfurt is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Exhibition with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles, and Turkey as a guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: indeed, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in the Room Structure, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Book Fair: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is declining gradually compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire missing on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
Debris were found on a plateau at 3000 metres altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft, however, no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, ejected the remaining doubts: "The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it was the one on which Steve Fosset was travelling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was detected, a team of investigators sent to the site, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon in 2002, two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the tour of the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among these records, also that of stealing 15,445 meters high on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An out of the ordinary 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, to the wider surfaces and net angles.
This, in synthesis, is Glk, the last born of off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh wind in this sector.
Just because its contents are out of standard, unexpected and non-conventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting October 17th.
Thus the advertising beat that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car fire.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milani shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that when we look at the image, the self is coming out of the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypic field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultimate Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, so far, had never created major problems.
Never had a fight with the opposing tifosi.
Group extraction is on the right.
The sponsors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (unfortunately) from Campania and Puilles added.
They had three-color flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken so they could not be identified.
They're inspired by the English distillery.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of real Nazis, the one of Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the party: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And indeed the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it might be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purging a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo which prohibits the attendance of Italian, but also European stages.
In short, our hooligans will no longer be at the stadium.
Thank God.
But now is the time for fear of emulation: that is to say, others risk adding to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We need to put an end to this fire immediately, and not to legitimise what happens like this" the Viminal supports.
So, " keeping your eyes open especially in view of the national team game of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Pouilles there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultra Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday, the Casms, who can even count on a section of the Ace, i.e. secret services, which are precisely dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatoire du Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we'll see what happened, and we'll evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles against Mameli's hymn: those there are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not police..."
