Found a 9-year-old boy with runaways in Tampere
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report from Western Tampere with his friend on the move has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, he's been contacted, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The son's father told Night Sanom that he'd been found in the middle of the night.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start work on it.
He was found in the neighborhood of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo's ass again... torn from the painting line to Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued to do his job also in the Master’s League.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo about the paint quality of the Champions League turned into at least a moment's later advantage.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goaltender statistics when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits in size.
Real won the match at 4-0.
Juventus has from the beginning stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the D-block of the Champions League it was violently started with a 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The victory was over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city bore the absence of Sergei Aguero, who was kneeling.
Aguero, who had been injured in the election league of the week, only came to the field at the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second group, United, experienced a hard time in the Netherlands after having suffered a 1-2 kill.
ManU's 20-year-old driver, Luke Shaw's guest match, took only 15 minutes.
The PSV Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding bill hit the target against the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw's likely broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of the home stadium in Eindhoven for ten minutes before the medical staff took him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 41st minute 1-0 line, but the joy of ManU only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno settled before taking a break in time.
The PSV winning goal scored Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
Paris Saint-Germain was the beginning of the A-block in the Champions' League of the Painting season.
The matter had been with Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who had changed the PSG used to Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised Johan Wiland, a goalie in Malmö, by the back of the ball.
Edinson Cavani made another half-time PSG 2-0.
PSG has been drawn to the top of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small associations, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow Tsska lost the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a resignation. The president made the wrong speech.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has made the same speech in the country’s Parliament as he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his speech, apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full life.
Chief Opposition Party MDC demanded Mugabe to resign because this is too old to control.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s head office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, governments should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministers' table.
Professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call.
Professor Shannon Lamb, on an emergency call, asked for a voice from the police to his home and told me that he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their dear dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told us that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentis and a handwritten message for the white paper: "I am very sorry and I hope I can cancel my act. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," in Lamb's letter, read according to the authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometres to the campus of the school. The police found their study room at the campus's hometown, where Professor Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to have been shot at by Lamb.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford stated that the university official received information about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
She says that Lamb called a fatal emergency call some time after that.
There was one more death in the day, and the Lamb took life when the police reached him.
On the next day, the students and teaching staff kept the locked doors sharp, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers investigated the details in both places, and the teachers who knew Lamb told us about the man, and the researchers created a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
Students always said they looked forward to the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier police station in Prentis, the professor did not have a previous background of violence or crime.
Schmidt had, in turn, mentioned Lamb in his book, which had given recognition to the "anie people" with whom he was allowed to spend his academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 staff members. Many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
The student, Brandon Beavers, praised Lambia, said that the professor seemed excited and nervous, "as if he was in an emergency."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about the stress at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University because of some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university salary policy meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked very hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the university, said there was no awareness of the contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly bothering something.
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route the Lamb had become from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life on a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a mile from his parents' home, the Washington County's death investigator, Methel Johnson, told us.
Lamb's car was still on the road.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told me he believed that the man knew the house's inhabitants.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started her work as a teacher of geography and education at the University, which has 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He received a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that he met Lamb through his friends when he was 15 and Lamb 20.
She was still with friends in high school, and Lamb was an interesting parent who spent years trying to teach Hairston his guitar playing.
"Lamb was a pretty heartbreaker at that time.
All the girls were on her meds," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing you for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but according to no document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in the brick house in the riverside in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told of his divorce from Prentiss 15 years ago.
"She was totally shocked," O'Steen said about her daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb but heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they sometimes played together.
O'Steen says his daughter is writing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lip harp for a few people.
Nothing said anything about something being wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were dating together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"The first year of the seminar was directed by Professor Schmidt, who was a specialist in Indian and colonial history," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied Emporia at State University Kansas and was the chairman of his own brotherhood and high school.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people gathered to commemorate the candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the night event, where the choir of the university featured songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
It's a better day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi from Cleveland.
Contributing journalists: Associated Press journalists at Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are now telling us that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further specified that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not going to hire as many seasonal workers as it was last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company intends to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews with the applicants will begin this month and the new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months left for the holiday period, the business season is approaching a good pace and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for sales and for the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "the date" with Princess Diana
The first night of the film's return to the future was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat at the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed there was an empty place next to me. I noticed that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox told me to come back in time document trailer.
"When the film started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document is related to the Future of the Films, and it also interviews Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, director of Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie returned to the future 30 years ago first night.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD format and is featured in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary General: no military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russian intensified military action and noted that there was no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that weapons only increased violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet with five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be scheduled for later this month's meeting of the UN Ministerial Week.
Mr Ban regretted that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, the Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity as was achieved in Iran's nuclear agreement.
Chapter 8 on support questions: Is Donald Trump serious?
We've tried to label Trumpi as an empty speaker.
He's also considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
In the Republican circles, (to date) the results have been sought in every way to pull Trump down the gallop line.
Ten out of eleven national gallops show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it actually tells us about the property mogul's options.
Of course, elections are only in the early stages.
There is no record yet that Trump is elected as a candidate for Republicans.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was at the time of the gallup in 2011, had to give room for Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would be in a difficult public election.
External groupings such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC as well as the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and started digging his image for his overthrow.
The following recent gallup data show that real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a bottle cap:
Trump's support is in full swing.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, the Gallup of Monmouth University said that only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding figure was 52 per cent.
Now, six of the ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also refer to the states in which elections are held as the first.
In recent weeks, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible choice of candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson has almost as enthusiastic a reception as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who is next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose share of support is 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans do not regard Trump's temperament as problematic.
Donald Trumpi has been widely criticized for his power and offensive comments. 52% of Republicans in the country’s entire population regard property mogul’s characteristics as appropriate for the presidents. The views are reflected in ABC News and Washington Post’s opinion poll.
The same is true of Iowa, where the first meeting of the parties takes place: According to Quinnipiac gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal characteristics to be appropriate for the chief of defence forces.
However, according to ABC and Post's gallop 44 percent consider Trump unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate to the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a candidate for the party, CNN and ORC's gallop say that four out of ten people believe Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten people would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Overall: Republicans have not previously had a very reliable crystal ball in use.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry likely to be a candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Although Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the shared camp is likely to benefit Trumpi, while Trumpi’s opponents are divided into the supporters of the different candidates.
Monmouth University's opinion measurement at the beginning of September revealed that Trump would almost always have a larger support force on behalf of a larger group in an imaginary double struggle between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paul at John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's on his way.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory from Trump with 19 points apart in an imaginary double struggle.
A small majority of Trump's supporters are already telling us that they have taken a vote.
According to CBS and NYT on Tuesday, just over half of Trump’s supporters are sure to vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not reached a final decision.
Trump's most competitive at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates vote twice as likely as Trump's.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of migration.
After Donald Trump's campaign speech, two months ago, migrant rapists from Mexico have been a hot topic for 2016.
Part of the concern is that Trump's powerful speeches expel important Latin American voters from Republicans and hinder the brand reform.
However, according to the results of the ABC News and Washington Post on Monday's opinion polls, six of the ten Republicans are on migration issues on the same lines with Trump.
As long as the migration is in the spotlight, there is also Donald Trump.
Dissatisfied with the administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans’ votes. The popularity is that both have come outside the condition.
The Republicans want a fresh face instead of a political group. ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion poll showed this view of Republicans of six out of ten.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to the opinion poll carried out by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time was eagerly awaited
The Labour Party Labour's new bowling image Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time to measure his strength in the David Cameron survey later.
Mr Corby's first six questions were raised a little after half a day, and the media and representatives of the Labour Party were watching him hard.
Corby's been listening to less theater and adding facts to the weekly show.
He has also said that he could skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In the run-up to Corbyn's leadership, Corby will be weighed in the first instance in the context of the parliamentary test, following the meeting of the shadow government and the annual meeting of Corbyn's trade unions at the TUC on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to silence the score during its national song on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War has received criticism from several Tory Party representatives.
Corbyn's silence during the national song attracted attention
The representative of Corbyn stated that Corbyn was standing during the national song while he respected in silence the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Smith of Corbyn's shadow government told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he had urged the party leader to join the national song despite the anti-monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team in calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign matters, and less than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements over British membership of the EU and the tightening of the government's conditions for granting benefits have increased in the Labour Party following Corbyn's appointment.
At the TUC meeting, Mr Corby told me that Labour intends to propose amendments to completely remove the restrictions.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to lower the ceiling from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour Director, led by David Cameron over the past decade by the Tory Party.
A new approach to the policy-promised Labour Director says that he has chosen the questions to Cameron from the audience on 30 000 proposals he has received.
According to Corbyn, from the electoral district of Islington North, there are too many clashes in the Question Time, and he promises to avoid the use of clever syllables and ransoms and says that he will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corby has found that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, supports him with questioning hours, for example, when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corby has also thrown out the idea that others too could sometimes get the voice, and he tells us that he was discussing this with Mr Bercowin, President of the House of Commons.
As Corbyn joined the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-theatre policy, which is often associated with the Question Time, but some years later he acknowledged that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the first survey in 1990, it has been seen as a key indicator of the leadership’s ability to judge, manage the lower house and position, but the critics say that the survey has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a homeless challenging environment.
A meaningful way has been found for the former street group to learn and make money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homes and earn money at the same time.
The BBC News met a young man who has graduated through the project among the first.

Punta strengthens as British wages rise
Punta strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in Great Britain compared to the corresponding period last year.
Faster growth than predicted was the fastest since 2009.
Punta was strengthened by 1% and its price was quoted at $1,5505. Punta was also strengthened in relation to the euro and quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended up at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary offer from the competing company AB InBevi.
When it comes to trade, the world’s two largest venture capital companies would be combined with the same under-roof fires, including, for example, Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the previous year's positive result of the competitive Richemont Group focusing on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. The sales development was also upside in the key markets of Burberry in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5 per cent from its reported intentions to raise $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Packing and Paper Group Mondi's shares were the largest drop of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sales purposes.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would rise by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hinder enlargement
According to Mr Cowgill, JD Sports’ chairman of the management group, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs can jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass roots campaign against Aldi's belting
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA sales from Aldi's power in South and West Australia.
Wholesaler of food products Metcash has launched a grass roots campaign to maintain the IGA retail market share in South and West Australia against Aldi’s $700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first one from up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA branding through the marketing of mainstream communications and social media, as well as by organizing events such as Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, ice cream factory Simmo, located in Dunsborough, offers tastings in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to customers for football games in South Australia at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Group organises an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, with South and West Australia accounting for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA sales footprint, and in these areas the yield is higher than the IGA sales network of the Eastern Länder.
Southern and Western Australian consumers are known for their neighbourhood communities and IGA dealers have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a 30% market share and West Australia has 24%, while the eastern states have only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will pick up 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores. Ketju will eat sales from all operators, but especially from non-chain operators.
This week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimates that sales of IGA dealers can come to 360 million and sales of Metcash at $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will expand in these areas to $500 million and $600 million.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of 13 million dollars in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath notes.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although according to Roy Morgan's recent investigation, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales decreased by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share decreased from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Chief Executive Officer Hamish Douglass of Magellan Financial Group told Melbourne that he was very likely to see Metcash disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass.
It is understandable that Mr Metcash's board of directors contacted Douglas last week.
After 2010, the market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14%, and Metcash, a 1200-seller, has fallen by 43 percent from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesaler takes counter action and makes an annual investment of over $150 million to meet Coles and Woolworth's prices for hundreds of products every week. Ketju wants to support merchants in the reform of stores, so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food mix of the trade's own brands.
According to Metcashi’s CEO, Ian Morrite, price adjustments and sales reform plans are at a good pace, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time to four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, defends Thanasi Kokkinaki
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of special mention of criticism.
According to Steve Heaty, the president of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a minor victim of a recent jupa related to Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger side of the double named "Special K" Kokkinakis became unfavorable when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after that, the judge had to divide the competitors twice in a short game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison. "Wawrinkan should have given back to Kyrgios and me," Harrison said.
In the open air of the United States, Kokkinakis hit a frustrated field when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has loyally defended Kokkinakis.
At the moment, the teenage star is in Glasgow, where he is fighting with Sam Groth from second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanas has been drawn along with the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open air of the United States. He is not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well that he is not proud of his work.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the United States of America, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a brilliant team around him, and I think he's only been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard and completes a very team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He is practicing hard, is in good condition and is really stable and mature for a young man. I think he should be judged on his own merit."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios Australian's team from an important round that begins on Fridays. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties. However, he supports the return of the Canberra breeder to the team's long-term confirmation.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on matches instead of polemics associated with Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As has been pointed out, among other things, by Federer and Murray, the young person is forced to grow in the spotlight. He deserves criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to organize his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
As a result of the emergency, Hungary declared its southern border closed on Tuesday from the direction of Serbia and caught illegal immigrants to prevent the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants collapsed in a non-EU country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People fleeing violence had to remain on the road between the inspection posts of the countries for an indefinite period of time.
It began to rise above the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they shouted "Open the border!" and shouted at the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them protested against the food and drink strike.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia stated that he did not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as further arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in the near future in Brussels and in other countries as well," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, the day began after the 28-state group failed in its efforts to develop a common immigration policy at the controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flood of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece would be shared, and the meeting hoped that by next month or the end of the year an agreement would be reached on which of the EU Member States would receive 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week in order to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for swift action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that, in two southern regions, the authorities were allowed to use more effective means, i.e. to close you and speed up legal processes in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migratory flows from the same direction, now that the fence is already ready at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners participated in the call for finalisation of barbed wire devices between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for immigrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and from elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the incoming people are refugees of the standard of living, not warriors who have the right to seek security.
According to the new law that entered into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to exceed or damage the four-metre-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and to determine longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the migration situation, the government is declaring a crisis situation in the country," said Zoltan Kovacs, who told journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We use a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, military action still needs to be adopted by Parliament, which is expected to take place next week. For several days, the journalists of the Associated Press news agency at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Orban's internal security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi reported that the authorities have caught 45 cross-border attempts at the immediately border and 15 further away.
People who have crossed the border are now in police custody, accused of crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two border crossing points at the border with Serbia on Tuesday.
Kaaos took the main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal box at the point where people packed in.
About 20 got inside, but thousands left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People announced that they were in a food and drink dump until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders reduced by one side of the national gallop
The percentage of support for former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still double-digit in the race for a national democratic presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has, however, cut off the distance.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the Democrats (down from 58%), while Sanders is second to 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure at the presidential contest, with 15% of his support among the Democrats.
More than five months before the first elections, it is too early to tell the majority of the Democrats who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton’s supporters are more certain of their choice than other candidates.
After the gallop made by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support from several democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a solid leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly and only has a 5% stake compared to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his lead among democrats under the age of 50, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton continues to have a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in support shares with Sanders was two-digit among the Liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-per-cent neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a candidate for the party.
Fourthly, Clinton would be supported with little reservations, and 15% would be supported only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic even if he were elected candidate.
The visions are more fragmented among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
Of the Democrat voters, 48% would support Clinton, and of the Republican voters, only 35% would be enthusiastic about Donald Trumpi, the most popular Republican candidate.
When Clinton's voters are asked freely to describe why they are in favour of his nominations, Clinton's most popular argument is the right experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 %).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The vice-president still pointed out his potential for a candidate, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to go to the race, but the third would rather leave him out of the race.
When the two most popular candidates are asked to run for the party, most of them choose Biden.
After Clinton, Clinton's supporters over half of Biden are the second most popular candidate and significantly more popular with Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate competition, Hillary Clinton will increase his lead over Sanders. Sanders will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democrats regard Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the actual elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden in second place is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
However, the Democrats consider views on the issues at stake to be more important than winning opportunities for candidates.
The voters do not regard any democratic candidates or potential candidates as unacceptable.
Voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable characteristics.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and leading.
Biden is most commonly described as honest, whereas Clinton is most commonly considered as a leader type.
Of the Democrats, up to 30% do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, Sanders in turn 15%. 27% do not know if Sanders is honest.
The Democrats believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the electorate's own ideology.
About a quarter of all properties have no opinion of Sanders.
When the voters are asked about the private e-mail and the use of their own server as Foreign Minister, most of the democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed the understanding of these voters about Clinton.
More broadly, the Americans disagree.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report and only one third are satisfied.
People’s opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come to an end.
The majority of Americans consider that the use of the contested email has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, six out of ten are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, these characteristics can be improved by asking the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not consider Trummi to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades of leadership.
Of the six candidates in the questionnaire, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of Sanders.
The sample is 351 voters and the margin of error of the questionnaire is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson tacks up Donald Trump's front trip in the national support question
CBS News and New York Times report that Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates slashed over half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among the Republican voters in the whole country. The rate of support has risen from 23% of last month’s debate on CBS’s questionnaire before Fox News. According to the survey announced on Tuesday, the rate of support is 27%.
However, Carson’s support would jump to a peak in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all population groups.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, will be far away. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker’s support is weaker and has fallen from 10% to 2% last month.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and the Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio shared third place with 6 percent in support.
The margin of error 376 in the sample of the Republican voters is 6% in one direction or another. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the most recent survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is on the rise and he is in favour of 19% of Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
The latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post also led Trump clearly above Carson.
In the men's meeting last week, Trump fired endless accusations against retired neurosurgery, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's belief.
"We need energy," Trump said in his campaign in Iowa on Saturday.
Five members of the team accused of the death of Baruch College Fuks
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the county’s ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Ps team members brutally assaulted Chun at the baptizers of the "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the team did not deliver Dengi to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim’s eyes were tied, his back had been placed on an almost 15-pound bag filled with sand, and he had repeatedly been attacked as he tried to reach an object that was placed on the other side of the frozen field.
Dengin is first told that he had a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps Department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, claiming they waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
At the press conference, Chief Chris Wabner told members that they had time to change Deng's clothes, go ahead with his symptoms and contact Andy Mengi, President of the Department.
"At this stage, the members began to hide the instruments, putting Michael Deng's interests ahead of his health," Wagner said.
Deng wasn't recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the body - opening protocol, Dengi had been hit several times in the head, in the upper body, and in the thighs with a heavy object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the splendor of the party, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the splendor since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The participants and their members must be held accountable where the authorities have to take an important step.
A large jury from Monroe County accused five members of a third - degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the team are charged with the embezzlement and criminal conspiracy. Meng is also among the defendants.
"We want to have accountability not only for individuals, but also for officially or informally approved organisation," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the operation of the Division, and the National Department dismissed the operation of the Local Department.
Thus, the US Central Bank's (Fed) interest rate increase affects
The rise in interest rates and the rise in the stock market are acidifying, the return on securities is rising and the economy is sliding into the recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everyone will take and how long the effects will last.
With regard to the economy in particular, we find historical evidence of timing.
The Lama has arrived in up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, but not always. The determining factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
For this reason, central bank officials have already been eagerly stressed that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to how long the normalisation of the situation takes.
Of course, there are a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players can see that any over-swinging in interest rates may be excessive.
"After the global financial crisis, the first increase in the Central Bank's financial situation was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of a cheap end to money," said Julian Jessop, Capital Economics's chief global economist.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level.
However, it does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples based on these historical trends of how the effects can be seen in the various areas of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the recovery in interest rates may add to the instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the rise in capital interest income after the first raise for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy, the analyst at Deutsche Bank concluded in a recent study on the impact of the increase in interest rates.
As revised over 35 years, the market generally sees a sharp rise in interest rates, around 14 %, fairly steady for the next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 %), the situation normalized after 500 days, and the average return on interest after the six stock ratio is 14.4 %, says Bob Doll, Chief Asset Management of Nuveen in the strategic Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsches, the impact on the shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage and interest income will begin to decrease.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the central bank meets the conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the downturn.
Particular attention is paid to the fact that the gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been less than 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015 appears to be 3.6%, many did not imagine it to be sustainable, and in the third quarter it will be 1.5%, says the Atlantic Regional Central Bank.
If interest rates are raised in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be a risk and one can ask if this situation is different, the Deutsches said.
In the market, the players have talked about raising the interest rate throughout the year, and the eyes are turning this week to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that even if the Open Market Committee accepted the increase at this meeting, future trade only shows a 25% probability.
"All the upturn cycles to date have been in the supercycle since 1950, where even before the downturn, GDP will rise very rapidly as a result of the downturn," the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession of the tax period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been expecting since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the past in the market for interest rates, and this formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes prices.
For bonds, returns seem to change as soon as the first climb/down cycle begins.
At the end of the upswing, revenues will fall immediately", Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the interest rate will make the long and short term bonds approach each other and smooth the curve.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about earnings," said Kathy Jones, analyst of Schwab's fixed-income securities.
Fascinatingly, Jones says that the market has already adapted to the future direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and forecasts of inflation, there are already several signs of a tighter fiscal stance," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of market conditions where the central bank is tightening policy.
By and large, companies that mainly operate on the US market benefit as interest rates fall and local products start to attract.
The prospects for the indebtedness of multinationals are weaker, as the stronger dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months," says Goldman Sachs analysts.
Firms with a strong balance sheet defeated the weak balance sheet in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, after interest rates of five percentage points.
Enterprises with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also achieved better quality, on average 4 and, respectively, 3 percentage points better.
"What's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from a stronger dollar.
The savers also benefit from a higher yield, although the experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
The concertor Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being too popularized.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
It also claims that the BBC Music Awards will only be a copy of the British Gaala.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, in turn, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually turns into a copy of the Classic FM channel, and the charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that each commercial radio station is offering more than one.
The concertor Andrew Bingham also told the head of the BBC that the radio channel of the public radio company is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer very different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards ceremony held last December also receives criticism from Bingham:
"For the first time in the year, the BBC Music Awards seem like a copy of the Brits Prize.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of new and different, only what is already on the market is being imitated," says Bingham.
The BBC Director General denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers a much more live music and enlightening content to a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to making live music and music is in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said that the station needs to work even harder to keep the public in mind, because the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one who received criticism from the BBC channel, in consultation with the Committee on Culture, the Media and Sport, of a hard commercial channel.
Tory, MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice's search competition, which the BBC purchased from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, for which a price of GBP 22 million is estimated for the sale.
"The programme is not much discussed, as it is not unique or distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, BBC1's program, stared by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for the BBC.
Collins also called on the company to look for a hit program in its own language as it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the continued ordering of The Voice series or the use of taxpayers’ money in other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in online commerce in August – possibly due to black Friday
In the first few months of 2015, online commerce grew by seven per cent.
Sales of online sales have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was slower than ever.
The online trade was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchase.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can control the purchasing desire.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online commerce has left many of Britain's shopping streets out of control.
According to experts, there is evidence that online commerce is on the rise and new sales figures show only seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slow throughout the period when sales of online trade have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online trade grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there is evidence that online commerce is on the rise and new sales figures show only seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If last year's growth is compared to the 2000 reading, it is clear that growth is going to be even over time," IMRG editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers took up mobile shopping.
"With this, more and more were able to buy from the network, and it was possible for many to buy from a different environment, for example by hand.
As mobile purchasing is more moderate, growth can be evened out."
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last Friday day of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal caused many merchant websites to crash.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers push after the offers, can curb the desire to buy during the rest of the day.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of shopping malls.
The Meka is burying the victims of the crane accidents, the Bin Laden family, for their responsibility.
Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the major construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mecca’s Great Fairy.
There had been a group of white - dressed people meeting on the streets to leave their victims on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad one walked on a pilgrimage site, where a fallen construction tower had only one day before invaded the mosque’s roof on Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia is demanding that Bin Laden's family business be held responsible for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of the 29 dead victims of the Meccan Great Fair were transported in the streets.
Following the fall of the Nostur, Qasim Akram from Bolton of Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Mosque, who were starting their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The authorities of Saudi Arabia have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people arrive in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left up the crane boom when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English news service did not report in detail. However, according to the English bulletin, the Group’s management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Fairy. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Grand Fairy’s Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a press release on the accident and its representatives have not been targeted for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of non-compliance with updated security regulations and of cooperating with meteorology experts.
The ten cranes surrounded Mecca's Great Emperor as part of the gigantic construction project of the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close connections with the Saudi ruling family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several important construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in a lifetime, was the accident in the heavy rain and the wind.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered the payment of a million rial (about EUR 250 000) to be paid to the victims' relatives and permanently disabled.
Other persons injured in the accident will receive half the compensation.
According to the B&Q team, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon
The British more often hire the generals of the home, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe, who work as professionals.
More than 200 new Srawfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Principal, Daily Mail
The British are said to be transferring home-carrying and painting work to actors from Eastern Europe.
These days, the skills of hammering and painting seem to be scarce.
Today, the British are increasingly hiring generals of the home to perform home quarrying work, says the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO at Kingfisher, which owns the home’s repair equipment store chain. According to Laury, the background to the phenomenon is the skilled workers arriving from Eastern Europe who offer services at the highest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores, aimed at business operators. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q sales, as she makes eight out of ten purchase decisions at the store.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, people’s trends need to be taken into account, for today an increasing number of women living alone are also rebuilding their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are behind the UK FTSE 100. She has also reorganized the company’s management team in such a way that men and women leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with 50 per cent of its staff being women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important issue for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board of directors."
Kingfisher's half-year business profit and sales figures are down, even though the company worked hard after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-stage government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the broad mental expression of the workers.
A lot of people feel that there is reason at that time too.
Well, let's see if it's worth it when it's bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to report that they are not going to participate in the mental exercise but are going to work.
At an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no web where to protest, but the open declaration of blasphemy would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of trade unionists in a few tens of thousands of people do not protest very quickly, but the reason for thinking is that it gives.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of Ay's activity, the government's raw solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years now, when things seemed to be rolling on their own weight, the unions are finally making it possible for them to defend, to be visible and to be properly and effectively.
Thus, the government may wish to perhaps capture the role of the Ay movement, once membership of the union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Let us take whatever we think about the activities of the organisations, it is a mess that Friday's mentalisation would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is continuing to decline and unemployment is rising.
I think these things are making everybody's head come on.
The University of Lappeenranta's high savings envelope: Targeted at 8.5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings period with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the University's savings strategy, negotiations will start for the entire staff, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 employees.
In addition, the other two million will be saved.
The YT negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
In this financial period, the university will achieve a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The expenditure will grow slightly next year, but funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction of corporate funding in our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trusted persons will be launched next week on Tuesday and will be governed by the law for six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland’s railways
Onnibus owner of Halpabus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest rail companies," Souter says.
Rail is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first one is the local transport of the Capital Region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-distance traffic in turn after the near-traffic.
Souter is already telling us that he's approached the Ministry of Transport.
Yle says the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus's plans.
Other international companies have reported interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
Central Bank of the United States of America time of the interest rate decision
The whole world will be followed by the meeting of the US Central Bank of Fed on Wednesdays and Thursdays, which will decide on the possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
Fair half of the economies that still believed the Central Bank to raise interest rates last week are now counting on the Central Bank to maintain its interest rate levels in the current 0 to 0.25 %, which is reflected in the survey conducted by 80 economists from Reuters.
"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has been keeping its interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of extra dollars into the balance sheet and has only accelerated a little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not as rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there is also evidence of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20.00 Central European time.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped that he could cancel it, the authorities told him Tuesday.
The Lamb, a teacher of geography and social science at the Mississippi Gautier, called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb, on an emergency call, asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that doesn't harm anyone but is probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting either.
The police arrived at the time of the hypocrisy and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and Lamb's hand-written message, reading as follows: "I am very sorry and I hope that I could withdraw my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his life away late on Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, president of the university, said there was no awareness of the contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly bothering something.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb probably believed that Prentiss was also romantic in relation to Schmidt. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a human being.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's shocked.
The man said the daughter and mother were the best friends.
Sun Herald says Prentis's close friend Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for the third year. He also told me about a woman named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during the Monday and told them that he was not going to go to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled his foot, ran into the woods and took his life.
According to a CV on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in educational science at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Dirty Stars
The last years have been heavy for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything has really taken place.
Manchester United’s Luke Shaw page for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right foot broke into a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman will be disappointed to stay side by side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field again this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense zone in the bad score of Héctor Morenon, while the game was in motion for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two fractures on his feet, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The youngster who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has experienced a lot and now gets hurt after great gambling.
They gave Shaw some oxygen in the dressing room.
The man cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks two points, he's on his side for half a month and he's not playing any more in the block phase.
I hope he can play for this season.
Moreno seemed to be at a low rate when the situation did not follow the red card penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian sitter made a mistake.
"You should decide for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a two-legged, loose-legged jacket."
Shaw tweeted this way: "Thank you for all your messages. I can't say I can't describe how broken I am. My recovery starts here and I'm getting stronger."

The English defender has a special reason to recover in order to race for the European Championship in France in June.
"This is a very bad case of injury," said PMV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his leg when he played in the World Championships of 2014 at Van Gaal in Mexico.
"He's very sorry, because his purpose was not to hurt the opponent. It's a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw a ball that was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's score."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult the situation like this can be," Moreno said on the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm very sorry."
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Before long, each parent will notice that the child is learning his favorite book almost outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name her favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 teaching story by Dr. Seussi.
In the text published on SuperCamp’s website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or message that we haven’t noticed before.”
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the book's plot is the summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short original text.
"The city of Tarville, from which the right trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, is home to a boy named Ted, who wants to reach the heart of his dreams of the girl Audrey by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," the text says. In 1991, Dr. Seussi, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, had no object of admiration.
If this isn't suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the narrative of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: "The city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, is home to a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl's dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book’s plot would be so strange to him. Ahne Kerskanen will destroy the trees and prepare them for the required name-word in spite of Lorax’s opposition. Lorax is small and thick, a fictitious creature that protects the forests.
Probably such a small PR task, in its sense, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times as a child.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment on the matter in more detail, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard
The encounter with Pakistan in the Combined Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when we see the final 3-0 test series of the team selected for the English tour, it is not expected that the loss will be repeated.
I wouldn't shut down even the chance of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a team three years ago, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences from 2012, just young positives.
As a floppy player Moeen Ali develops as a circuit user, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have a Test Level experience, represents the attack option.
Related topics: Adam Lyth dropped out of the English test team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to abandon Adam Lyth is hard for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that crooked players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best pickers.
A few 50-point fight would have been held on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire more runners.
The UK head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he could not have done as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is above all a team player.
The question of how long a test shot gets the opportunity to make its impact is difficult.
Lyth received seven matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance in both home and guest matches.
The only subject of complaint is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was at the top – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he's a hit guy I appreciate high.
He's an unknown actor's crike player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this of course depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
There's a thrown-out idea that Moeen will start a kick-off with Cook, which will bring an extra round-up player to the game while holding four quick-runners, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see an obstacle to a top player being hit here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great crike player.
Moeen may not have made much of his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a team triple player, and that's no big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games as the first replacement player before getting started in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a reserve feeder, and on the basis of what I have seen from him he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a striker and 35 as a feeder — and this can be a search light, but very many loop users have not shown that they are ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this match trip.
Outside the gaming team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan fighter Mahela Jayawarden as an advisor to the test games can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most delicate men of the species who brings a great deal of experience because he has played in all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball of the game trip, bringing energy and mercilessness, among other things.
In my opinion, he has always influenced the appropriate international crike, be it his role as a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has the intelligence to exploit.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it would say the same thing as before, can be a stimulus injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting in one day's fights, Root received a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions never fail to be taken.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is at a bad pace in 2017
David Cameron's re-negotiation strategy for maintaining Britain in the EU is becoming ever deeper and deeper day by day, even without pleasure Jeremy "yes or no" Corbynia's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC mocking Europe on Tuesday.
In other countries, too, there are their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is in – even though not everyone is doing their own thing – some of the Member States have become tired of the UK's self-righteous agenda, which includes concessions and damaging changes to the Treaty that they do not even want.
At Brighton's annual TUC Congress, it was decided that they will not be entertained in the EU either if it breaks down social security.
We could call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have an extravagant Britain inside the EU. 'Don't leave us alone with France', Berlin says and suggests that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where we don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the sensible Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it gets ruined, as was the case with those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Holland has a choice of re-election or successor in 2017.
His power is on its way, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, in Spain again a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them rushing to help the selfie British who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the UK, and they do not want it either, because most of them have Separatism.
Some of these ministers may deliberately plan to throw useless comments on the Scottish national party in the British 2017 popular election campaign, which wants to push over the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a case in point." "There was nothing left in the hands of Britain about the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British press is caught and how the EU sceptical oligarch press is, just like Tony Benni's 1975 referendum, the result of which was 2:1 in favour of accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may well remember Boris Johnson, a famous Euroopportunist who became known as our "EU direct banana correspondent" at the beginning of the 1990s in Brussels.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include taxes, hacking phones, and apparent-like people who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but then realized that when in cage with a rough gorilla, bananas have to be turned over to be confused so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was the most blairist in his opposition to the referendum, and Mr Blair admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the 2005 referendum, Mr Blair made a good move.
The press never forgiven him for that.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly tapped me back on Westminster on Monday. I told him he no longer has time to waste on me. It may be a risk that he will be introducing Neil Kinnock’s media boycott strategy from the 80s. It was a mistake and still is.
You can spend time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marrin, whom he sat on the BBC chair on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to respond positively.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Benniti" Benn told me on radio and on television this week when his internal patrol tried not to admit that Corbyn had a bad call to appoint karsky John McDonald as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father had difficulties on television with his disloyal Labour colleagues without going too far and without losing their place in the basement.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under "all the circumstances", and McDonald did not say that, nor did Corby's colleagues and members of the lower house at a private meeting on Monday night.
Want Corby cares how much the sucker's image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The messenger is important during the 24/7 period, especially in the social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud are close.
There is no need to give Cameron a free passport with regard to the EU, in which he could see Labour's support as self-evident in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks this.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivalence of EU membership is consistent with the Benniti's island economy and the anti-capitalist past; the discussions are no longer just a matter of left-wing opponents, for whom the idea of combining similarity is central to the doctrine of doctrinal twins.
As for NATO, we have also seen equipment. Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that Corbyn does not campaign for the departure. Foreign diplomats have to try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters, why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be useless?
The United States has already been quite disappointed by British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operations of the Tory Government, and I was reminded of it during the British Influence Security Forum launch on Monday.
Experts criticize the UK Authority's opinions on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of the State-funded body that the incineration of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were generated at a meeting of 12 participants, which is linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health UK (PHE) Public Health Authority (PHE) report on electric cigarettes.
PHE described its report last month as a "reverse and comprehensive review".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and raised the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the editorial last month, Lancet Medical Journal took the "substantial base" on which the PHE's most important conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have wondered in the BMJ whether the claims have been made on "cland or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and the University of Liverpool Clinical Epidemiology Professor Simon Capewell have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the best estimate at the moment is that electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim is based on a 12-person meeting called for a multi-target evaluation (multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA) to develop a model. The model sought to harmonise the participants’ views on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The meetings were compiled for the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which according to its sources has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) by its former independent director.
In addition, the Executive Director showed support for BAT’s public health activities in the report on sustainable activities.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the electric smoke manufacturer. However, the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not allow that participant.
The selection criteria for the Panel's composition have not been clarified, but there are several well-known producers of electric cigarettes, some of whom are granted their participation as a funder of industry.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the area of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by a PHE tobacco correspondent.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's investigation report shows that there is no undeniable evidence of product harm with respect to a large proportion of products and their compliance with their criteria.
However, connections or deficiencies are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has so far been no evidence that electric cigarettes can promote the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of health and well-being at PHE has previously responded to the allegations.
According to Fenton, electrical cigarettes are considerably less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smoked through life dies because of smoking addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than those of conventional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not indicate, especially in situations where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80,000 deaths from smoking each year, and the cost of smoking to the public health care is £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires us to show clearly the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, who was in charge of Channel 4, has said that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would hand over their right hands on hit series, such as Albert Square soap series.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the work of programmes that are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes to a smaller audience at the same time as the large number of competitors, as well as the BBC4 channel, for example.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall had announced that the company would like to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years to co-operate with the BBC on Channel 4.
"I do not agree with the idea of the BBC purchasing formats and sending programs that would clearly belong to some competing channel software," Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee, which was explaining the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to pay a radio fee, which, in my opinion, is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice to the best viewing time because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If no other channel is concerned with the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, even though it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give it its right hand.
I don't understand how this serves the service offered by the public radio company.
I don't think these would be losses to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur led by Channel 4 from 2004-2010, who believes that the BBC is getting good ratings, because the company is working for ambitious people and they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on the BBC’s most popular series are similar to former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested at his MacTaggart lecture in 2003, that the BBC sell out groups such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's Niche-General programs are shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewers are usually unable to measure, but the programs fulfil their purpose. "The BBC can say that, in defending the hypocrisy of its missions, it has made special programs with a four billion pounds of radio charges, which nobody saw."
"The BBC presents them as times when no one ever sees them."
Johnson said: "I challenge you to look for another system that is just as old-fashioned as anyone who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people with whom it is a large sum, especially if the BBC is not looking exactly."
David Elstein, former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also reported on his views in the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should change its ancient missions to "information, education and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there is hardly any educational programme available at the present time – 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian public radio companies and call for a new belief in the mission: "information, lighting and entertainment".
With regard to the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase the number of broadcasts from events, such as the Proms Festival, which was broadcast only last year by a fraction of the concerts. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offer available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled with sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle lamb changes direction when the ultrasound is applied to them.
Researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, so that worms can be controlled with ultrasound.
Small shock absorbers change direction when subjected to ultrasounds with a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion cells that have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
Add subject: Researchers following brain activity with light
According to researchers, the maggots were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics).
Salk Intuite researcher Sreekanth Chalasani, located in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation (DBS).DBS therapy is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms, which stimulates the brain by electric impulses.
Chalasani found that worms, however, start to react when they are placed in a liquid with small microscope bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that move in the worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worms' cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To be able to control the shuttle lambs with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that I was familiar with their movement-driven nerves appeared on the TRP4-ion channels.
When the ultrasound was controlled into the converted mats, the microphones confirmed the sound waves and moved into the mats, leaving a signal in the nerve cell.
The method reminds a bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain under investigation by means of light fibers. The low-frequency ultrasounds instead easily penetrate the cell, so the ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral treatment can allow human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasounds in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture equipment — your home door!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arms trade show video.
Horrifying killer missiles!
Footcars breaking the ankles!
The grape bombs!
Remote lambs that cause intolerable pain but do not leave behind!
The joyous sound and cartoons clearly reveal that this advertising of the world’s largest arms trade show is parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government’s efforts to sell weapons to the repression governments at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) trade fair, which is held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in London, in Docklands.

There are also posters for bus stops and metro cars that require a second look.
"Important message: does the metro move from 15 to 18.9.?" The notice reminds the outside of the signs of the London metro. There is a picture of the tanker at the end of the metro line on the other side.
"In September, a number of arms dealers will arrive in Dockland, requesting help from the customers to stop the arms trade."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who worked at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
The collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a six-pound "ad-space hacker package" with six-inch keys that allegedly reach about a third of the world's bus counters.
Transport for London is not a declared vandalism laugh.
One of the special patrol group's pill ads.
According to Gavin Grindon, a lecturer at the University of Essex, the curator of Cruel Designs, the artists have started to question things and want to bring political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world. Many people are also moving to work with protest activists.
One of the anti-arms trade declarations greets public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100 000 times a day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the times have also done their work without compensation.
The VCCP's artistic director, Matt Lever, hurried about the absence of the exhibition and the empty point in the ExCeL event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They have done a great job and helped us to raise the mass where illegal torture equipment is being traded," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded right at our home door."
However, the most creative item of the exhibition may be presented at ExCeL, where the exhibitors use great circular expressions of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. Army for "Covering the AT4CS RS."
The product includes "specially shaped warhead, which effectively penetrates directly to the object."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Students in Student Housing
I moved to the student residence 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barets and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the violent smiles I annoyed, and countless long complaints of others.
The most important lessons can be summarised in eight simple rules.
The migration to the apartment is a difficult experience, and the worst of it is a shock.
In the situation begins easily with an argument: you tell everyone where you are, did you have an intermediate year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "just hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, a figure, I'm in my room."
In the meantime, take a breath.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask about other things.
The interview will guide the conversation and help you to find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk about when your tears were in the air and these people were sharing extinguishers.
Give me the rest of the room.
The rooms are often served as drinking counters, cinemas and common lounges, but the room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
Add topic: Don’t even think about uniting with college studies
The University of Introverts is a tough place
The room should be a place for calming down. However, in many residential areas there is a social culture that moves from one room to another and forms lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to find out if someone from your student friends has become exhausted in social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and instead send a text.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
In my own student residence, there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when the bread is in, so if you're baking brownies and knocking on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little bit strange in case: "Come to the neighborhood, I've baked something small for you.
Homey treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your fellow students have to talk to you, and with the surprise of their taste, they can get a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve bad flour, sugar, and fat-cuffed cooks, others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Food feeding is also a common source of student housing.
Taking a second chicken, of course, is stealing, but is it possible for the tea to fall off someone else's milk cane?
Always make sure the milk can is owned by the owner.
You'll probably get a permit, even if you're the owner of your bottle of milk.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone waffles something from you. Still try to deal with the situation as adult as far as possible – unlike my own student friend who laid off the detergent in his milk as a punishment for the milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make noise when others try to sleep or to hump.
It's not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every one of you digging a hole...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the resident of the room to adjust the music to a smaller degree, as it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally quieted in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours for the exam, left the music to shave into her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought your student mate was your future spouse, you would start dating, divorce, and have to see him every day and lose the right of your friends to meet him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If a student friend is not absolutely the only one who wants to be controlled.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the border between the stick and bullying is more puzzling than might be thought.
It's a good joke, but someone who'll recover in a moment.
Hidden some object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no room should be confused with toothpaste and sampoolla.
The door of the second room can lock and drop the keys into the water glass that is placed in the freezer, but do not attach any items to the ceiling with a blue box a few times more.
Racist attack on foreign students' dormitory in Kitee - The house planned to become a reception centre was tainted in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia, at the shelter for foreign students.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors but the dormitories of foreign students who have already lived longer in Finland, says Kite’s teacher of the Gospel People’s School Heidi Luukkainen.
The National College's windows and walls were engulfed with racist signs, such as scavengers, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation spaces, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Lukeinen, who was responsible for youth social security education at the National School of Education, the building that was the target of violence had an estimated 10 people at the time of the attack.
"Being a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luke says.
There are people from 12 different nationalities who are housed at the National School.
They are already students who had been in Finland for some time and are still seeking asylum from minors.
All those who have been involved in the building have an a-story.
Part of the study is in adult education, part is in vocational studies and part is in Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to an outsider who has already been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police investigate the attack as an act of injury and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Lukeinen, on Monday there was a briefing for students, including the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic around here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had several decades of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," Luke says.
Luke says it's been cleaned out of the walls.
As perpetrators, at least three men were suspected to have been involved and had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the tip of the youth's weekends when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious about it," Luke says.
Salo has also been tainted at a hospital that has been planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
That's what MTV told me on its website on Tuesday night.
The hospital's wall had been drawn by a swindler and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected by the police for incorrect information about the age and status of the residents of the building.
The state will stop the Y-train for Karelia, the passengers in their messes, the "weird idiot countries"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Karelia stops going in March.
The news shocked passengers arriving at the start of the train at Helsinki main train station.
In particular, the descent strikes the wingers, said Torbjörn Bengtström, resident in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the number of people living in the city is growing, and people working at work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
On the interview video of HSTV, Bengtström says that he will come to the capital, even on a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place in other New Zealand countries.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry is purchasing train services during the next contractual period.
The contract period varies year-on-year and the routes to be closed are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Sigtström believes that the state train driver is a short-sighted activity.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance on top.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raaseporians and the Bontians, because it is fast and bypasses multiple stations.
From the Espoola, the fate of people travelling beyond the city area was compromised by Annina Pöyry on the train.
"It's very sad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y-train.
It's a little bit easier.
It is likely that there will be a new train connection on the track, replacing the Y-Bahn in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonumm.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and for their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to find different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, the Ministry much more so.
The R line on the main track is missing two stops.
Instead, the number of trains is doubled in Ainola and Sauna Kalli.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are stopped throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the Pieksäki-Status route.
Train stops are reduced on the routes to Riihimaki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made on the stop-over journeys, with approximately nine million trips in total purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state 12.3 million annual savings.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital Currentity: "Marxin supports familiarity"
The global economic crises have put on the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusions published in 1867-1894 on Capital, writes in the book Yrjö Hakanen, known as SKP's former president, today, the topicality of Marx's Capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion are becoming increasingly widespread in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the increasing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakanen is also available from Aalto University professor, a respected economist Sixten Korkman.
In Korkman's book, Marx writes that he is "new and eternal".
However, is the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Delegation of Industry not Marxist?
No, not at all.
Korkman tells us on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and writer.
"The common idea is that the history of the idea tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early course of capitalism, Korkman considered.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The more relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, Marx’s concerns are being discussed, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical transformation," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx, is not helpful.
He thought capitalism was an hopeless case that should just end.
Yet Marx is in favour of Korkman's idea of familiarity.
"In the '70s Marx could not read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyites and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx too can approach without the ideology and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the armed forces in Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamils of war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka estimates that at least 100,000 people are dead.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, in the last few months of the long war, a major attack by the armed forces should be properly investigated, the UN report called for.
Sri Lanka’s Armed Forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a United Nations court because of foreign judges.
In the Yo test in England, social media score
The autumn high school writings had a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was in English.
More than 16,000 test children tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it might have been possible to write about social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article in the 150-250 English language could point to the magazine’s book keeper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to look at things from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects for which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates third subject in Porvoo, Swedish-language high school English teacher Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was really nice.
It had to write a fire speech, why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "the way normal".
The test in Finnish or Swedish provided answers to questions about texts such as adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the test will be done by another Finnish, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In readings, the test is organized normally, i.e. the mental expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Board of Students urges the experimentors to search for suitable traffic links in time to get to the trial.
Additional time may also be given if it can be shown that the delay was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed Wednesday morning in the district of Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes and his face in a cover-up command pipe.
He's normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money to catch him.
They're investigating it as a serious robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The mental expression resisting the government's surgery decisions will clog the city centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Ava and STTK alliances will meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the mental exercise.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothing of the giant atmosphere.
The roads leading to the railway gate will be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 a.m. to 14 p.m.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniem traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction from Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki police station, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on the police's work-related issues.
According to Kujala, Helsinki has support parties from elsewhere in Finland coming to Helsinki for mental expression.
The exact number of patrols the police don't tell us.
"Something is coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic storm extends from Hakaniem to its nuclear centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning to early morning.
With demonstrators arriving from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of order buses coming.
They're not allowed to go to the Iron Tent.
The buses are, in principle, quite far away.
The final trip must then walk to the demonstration site", Kujala says.
Mental expression also stops Helsinki public transport.
From the point of view of the police, this is a positive side.
The question of traffic flow, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of the people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the expression have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of the economic policy of the government in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to go smoothly.
People are usually employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, the Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local expressions are also held on Friday across Finland.
Friday's expression of mind is exceptional in many ways. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great mental expression organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siisaisainen, Professor of Sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Sisaisinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is missing in contract law.
Here is a lot of evidence that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's moods.
The new is now the sharp division of the mental expression of which the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed, who met in different parts of Finland, expressed their opinion in the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If we look for a point of reference for Friday's mental expression, it could be a giant display of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Siisainen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai collected 20 000 unemployed.
The Esko Aho (central) government is collapsing from crisis to crisis in the labour market.
It was said that the differences between the Finnish Government and the employee organisations had never been as bad as they were in the Aho mayor’s government.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse than at the time of Murrostorsta.
Moreover, Finland's very bourgeois government is now in power, Siisaisainen says.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so narrowly right-wing despite the speeches of the basic Finns.
At that time, there were some elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
Mental noise also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres as well as schools.
Even if mental expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have taken place annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful, even though in recent years practices have become more difficult.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is legal.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisäinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The religion of the protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared for pig shit.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes on, among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
The strike of the metalmen took place in 70,000 metalmen.
The strike was interrupted with the introduction of the settlement board after seven weeks of strike.
Metal men received a 16% wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electrical strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom had become lowly unemployed, met for work.
Firemen broke down three months in 1998
The firefighter's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police came to the egg market in 1994 when farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the slogans.
To Spain, farmers caught tons of snow.
The European Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn haysticks in front of the meeting place.
Nurses stopped in 1983 and 1995
The nurses stopped for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike marked a number of deaths during the strike.
The Tehy threatened the strike and the mass deportation of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass disengagement ultimately boosted negotiations.
Doctors stopped in 2001
"Doctors in the strike - forced," included the strike of the strikers in 2001.
The strike by local health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and resulted in a lively debate on how the strike could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for help in resolving the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck at Aisterheim near the German border carrying 42 refugees.
There is no information as to whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility is on the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the Austrian Public Radio, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company operates in restaurants and its CEO is a foreign-based, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
I've got an escape captain, a former drug courier, a pervasive businessman, five smugglers' story.
The king of crooked smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-looking taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, working at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and these "clients", and their book Death Travel Office appears in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the trunks of human trafficking, make suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers from different business portals.
HS is presenting five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading for the summer celebration.
For their location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which is part of Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more productive in transporting people.
That is what Emir has done on a blue, ten - foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat fills up, it can accommodate 40 people.
One of the trips Emir earns about EUR 8 000 after the expenses.
Emir has five helpers looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the island of Kerkenna.
Emir will stay them in empty houses for as long as you can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer is out of money, it is their problem.
We're leaving for the water at midnight for a cut-off.
On the first night you drive off the island, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes it's hard to go to sea, and passengers weep and throw up on a 20 - meter high platform.
The human child has been bitten in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants her to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the hangovers to death.
He says in the book that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim on the nearest island.
"I caught customers individually from the neck and threw them over the edge," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear his compatriots are gonna have to abuse this.
I'll get rid of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
A regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovað, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and otherwise it's seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, mainly for families.
In the middle of the forests without their families, men travelling without a family are staying in tents, flats and abandoned cars, which is now what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families also live in the forest who have not, for reasons or other reasons, left an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossings and week-long walks in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When they finally reach the territory of Bogovaða, a major humane transport hub, people are dying.
Goran's Kyytians are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he tells us in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get a tink.
That's not what Goran likes.
That's funny, that's silly, that's silly, all the way.
For example, 300 euros will be agreed first, then they will count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes being a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he is working cheaper than others and that he is spending only EUR 50 per person at the Hungarian border.
It's three hundred miles away, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a large amount for the smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his riders one kilometer from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and hurries away.
♪ In the work of mercy ♪
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Envoy, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where a lot of believers flee from the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Messenger runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the rubber band of white calves is elegantly cut under the low belt of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his ground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and beyond Europe.
At first, the customer calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it is advisable to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money visually, and to plunge in with the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain an asylum seeker or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that it is from, for example, the northern Kivu war zones and that it has had to escape from home violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It will help the Messenger's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum search procedure, to the NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He charges every step separately: the application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, in a European country of EUR 4,500-7 000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom's an initial smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irish man on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver, and ten truck drivers who do not necessarily even know they are in a humane transport business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the city centre of Calais.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison to organise illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
The cab stops, Tom runs his customers over the highway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck. We have to make sure that it's on its way to England and not, for example, to Holland, and cut off the protective guard.
It's got to be done quietly so the driver doesn't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the tow is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in an aluminium foil, the same thing that is being wrapped in the kitchen around a roast or oven potato.
It should prevent police thermal scanners from spotting a hidden person.
Some use ice filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client's truck and leaves the place hoping that he won't be driving a scumbag of lightning passengers, at least before Britain.
King of secret carriers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous transport companies.
An uppoverty Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the unquestionably king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçük has been developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only asks for the money.
One of the new methods is the illusion of luxury: Turkish ports are rented out for a few days on tourist routes to the American or European families.
In reality, ships are being loaded in full from Syria, Iraq, Kurds and Afghans, transporting EUR 5 000-7 000 against the payment from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers will be kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until they leave.
People are trapped in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Navy can only observe how deeply the ship swims, because other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers eject and throw up, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 from one of the luxury trips after the costs.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but hires captains, recruits, guards, roommates and other smaller agents to do the work for himself.
During the summer, transport is arranged for at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought cover companies across the country, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently he's gone.
Correction from 16.9.2015 at 3.10 p.m.: The Travel Office of Death book will be published here, not next week.
American Olympic runners tell us in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times the new book Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter racer at the Olympic Games, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells us about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the race in peak condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead on a land run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power came to an end.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other competitors bypassed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself above the finish line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two - way mental disorder.
His brother Dan had made a year before the Sydney races for suicide, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money to have sex with foreign men.
He also oversold his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he's been using the money for his luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton’s prostitution was that he needed the same adrenaline peaks as he had won in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two - way mental disorder.
The double life of the former star racer came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the time of the world statistics 3.57,40, but stayed at the Sydney Olympics final.
The World Champion was delighted when the union put the Norwegian ski flower in control: "From the Great"
Norway's skiing queen Petter Northug has crossed the limits of convenience in the opinion of at least one of her colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have gone all summer and autumn as well as last year's Sports Agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the conflict in the agreement, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put a ski flower in control.
"Thank you for pointing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active sportsman to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the country team for the entire season, so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations and will not give one athlete in the solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured himself that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colours in the next season in the World Cup, as well as in the MM Games and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, including two gold medals.
He was involved in the team that won the message gold last winter in Falun.
The Sign Day of the Chicks also takes place in the North of Finland.
On Sign Day 25 September, there will be cuts in the various restaurants and shops to which the Signs of the Midwives have been awarded.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of Finnish food industry competence and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator are located around Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of an increase in the awareness of turtles and the organisation.
The day is organised in Vaasa in the restaurant Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the day of the shield takes part in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
Indeed, it has been decided to make an organization one of the most important international events to be held throughout the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kaurajoki newspaper: Law Chancellor of the establishment of the Kaurava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava property currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure for the crisis, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, Finland's Erillisnetkot Oy.
The Kaurajoki magazine states that the placement of a reception centre in the same building structure by a private person would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have an interest in the territory of the former London School and in the airport, the effect of which has also not been investigated when preparing the reception centre, is written.
The case states that for the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Minister of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the fundamental opposition of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned site in the former facility is wrong.
The gruesome city government was dealing with the reception center issue last Monday.
Subject: The situation of Syria in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The administration means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on the editors in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all Parliamentary Parties in their official residence in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He values the ability of the government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially the most fundamental issues.
Especially at these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the report, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the United States, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If it develops in a positive direction, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to have an impact on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the report, the NATO issue was also sidelined in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

The Office of Early Childhood Education will be pleased to inform you of any further changes in its activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Chick takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, a wide range of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not remain for the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered in Yle channels.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires the public to have television and radio talks.
This dossier, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and calls for a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The call will be sent to TV1 and Radio Finland at 9:05-21.20.
It can also be viewed in Yle Area.
The pepper takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general government turnaround.
Is it an attempt to strengthen the right to define a public debate and to refuse public debate on questions?
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and that he does not allow himself to be defined.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related to each other.
The Koivunen understands that commercial media is agitated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not notification issues in democracy.
It is up to the media representatives to try to ensure that policy agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuen, the TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more we've heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are more than the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Generally take a risk in this sense if it is not a special situation, but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a communication between politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or public interest.
A smart bet from a pip
In the future speech of Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media researcher.
Tonight we should look at exactly where Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the six, the TV talk is a clever call from Sipila, because this is how this brings out one's own views without noises.
This will give the public a message without a journalist filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media might misinterpret something about the speech, because there are no specific questions to be asked.
According to the 6th, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV... that sweat flows, that hands shake.
He compares the Siple to the father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do his job well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform us of something, because this person is as if talking directly to another person.
Such (United Kingdom President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
Very exceptional
Policy researcher Erkka Railo regards the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens as truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades when the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathize with the pressures ahead.
On Friday, employee organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against government action.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announced that he would challenge the Sipilä dialogue.
There's no time for monologues.
It's been almost six months since the election.
You can't hide the rest, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time of the discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Finnish Internal Police Department also confirms the case to Iltalehti.
The boy left to play out at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that night, no longer got in touch with him.
Dad thanks all those people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times that's incredible in such a short time.
Finnish star UFC disappointed with the violent ferocity of young people: You can create hatred
A Kurdish freelancer, Makwan Amirkhani, published a video on Facebook calling for a migrant background for young people in particular.
Mr Amirkhani made a heavy statement against the street campaigns of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived with her family in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells us that he received a message asking him to check out a Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account in which young people fight for extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells us that she is disappointed with the young.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other, and without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people on the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to police commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, fighting videos for social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
Especially the fact that you're fighting on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani recalls that in Finland there are sites that seek the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very serious.
A little hard, boys, no more defending you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhani calls on young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become a target of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go in there, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a source of concern for racism.
You're gonna have to do something that I don't like.
By the way, you've got things pretty bad, and that's not going to get any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, says that the employee organisation will consider its position on the STTK's alternative savings list on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity target required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Akava's president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will adopt the proposal if SAK, Mr STTK and Mr Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that SAK, the largest employee organisation, soften its previous position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, in turn, made a brief comment on the subject on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that, in addition to the mandatory laws, agreements between the active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off negotiations on the social agreement when SAK did not agree to commit to a 5% productivity target.
Comment: The big-mouth show is threatening to grow up, "I think it's a little funny to put on a fist."
I think it's a little funny to put a fist on if there's a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
At the employee camp, the atmosphere varies from one side to another.
Is it intended to call upon the government to be overturned, or is it intended to agree with it?
On Monday, the presidents of the SAK broke out of holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be caught.
The man was also spreading to the acaves.
The OAJ threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or nursery is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of the STTK, Antti Palola (sd), took a peaceful stand.
He announced that he had been in contact with the government and that he had drafted an alternative presentation called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) to be a 5% productivity measure.
Sture Fjäder (Kok), President of Akava, hastily announced that his agreement is already in place.
At first, SAK's office didn't belong to any of them.
It is difficult for President Lauri Lylyn (sd) to agree when the leaders of the Union just on Monday told us to put the country on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will look for solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to give rise to a joint proposal by employees, the SAC should tend to accept a 5% productivity measure as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK is in good relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola's right hand, the head of the STTK's social impact, Jukka Illus previously served as a special assistant to Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhainen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola defined that the government's ay skills have improved all the time.
A coincidence or not, but the exit of Palola took a little clean away from the standers of Finland, whose bowling image shrouded by Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
I think it's a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if there's a paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Etyj Meeting in Helsinki.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, believes Mongolia is better than Finland's OSCE host.
In Mongolia’s capital, Ulan Bator has begun the sitting of the Ethyj Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Day.
In that case, Finland did not allow the arrival at the meeting of the Russian politicians who have been forced into the European Union, such as the Naryshkin, - a matter on which the President pointed out to journalists.
Our estimate was that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, according to Interfax's news agency, Naryshkin emphasized.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he had been denied access.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complicated, so Naryshkin continued his squeezing of Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for its "serious organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will be conducted constructively and with positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok), who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff point: "Paints tight"
Killer and Lock will continue today in Hakamets for bull days, while both will be on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets there are no real goalkeepers.
Last night, the killer went to Kuopio, digging for a three-to-two continuation win in KalPa.
The rise was male, because last season's silver team was worst off two goals of defeat.
Lock's Tuesday was more muddy.
The visitors of Blues, who started his catch in a coat, had round zero points, and the losses were also 2-3.
A tough game, you score tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, the Lock Attack Janne Lahti anticipates the settings of the company's pages.
The killer has formed a pretty heavy playoff for the traumatists.
In fact, in the past two years, the killer has just dropped into the gap in the final series of the Luko.
On both levels, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara got up in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
The two cashiers who have been rejected yesterday will be given a swing shift today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Visible: Just running a crappy play
Sports director Voivola has written a follow-up to Chief Coach Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film, where he played the main part.
As a sensationalist, the baseman put a tough line of struggles on Apollo Creed, the world champion.
Rocky had a great deal of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Voivola edited Pori's restless ashtray.
The nameless and woody fasting progressed to an astonishment for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough subjects like Rocky.
It was White Indian, Por Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquoise.
The wishing child became a blonde.
A great TV seller, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
You took the winning silver.
Wishing was one of the heroes.
Written by W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W.W.
A man who works as a former sports manager has built a dam on the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have hit guys in the neck like Rocky pigs at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamä, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kupariinen are due to be in something other than a wreathing game.
The wish has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI will be Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed into Rautakalli's Sean Connery.
Iron calibre is a clumsy part of Rocky's manuscript that Connery had in his original 1976 work.
There's nothing in the iron shed but Rocky. It's a nickname.
The game philosophy of the iron mine does not include rushing and small-scale hunting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different to play a hard game than a pig.
In the last season, the German Garret Stafford caught the Killer Jere Karelia in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Calli put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve even minutes!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of an acecheque, and after the game, the iron caliper was hot for the Hundred Nation.
The team of this season has been strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops and escalators.
There are no key men in practice in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, as Mr Rautakalllio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface, it's getting worse.
The year 1953 Iron calibre is known to be interested in the transition to a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The recent balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the losses of the 1-6 goal line.
Wishing would not have been a good idea to write a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm in a movie with my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it seems crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temone laugh.
He has been married to Apulana's ex-baset and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting for the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulana's "Teet of the Beauty" film is the mother of a drummer, Sipe Santapuki, Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, although this father Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirk, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted the role for me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
Sirka has helped so much.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirk also understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that the Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a paralysed and very bitter.
There was a pretty little probability that someone really would succeed, but Sira had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard from Tuuka a lot about this youth even before the film plans.
But the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s bad-known bowl.
Olga was an everyday and nice girl who wouldn't have anything to do with Tuuka.
At the highest, he could have hidden himself in love.
Olga says he's been working with Tuuka so much over the past 10 years that a big joint project isn't scary.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple who live there often plan to drive home for the night because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only asking what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to a more expensive Finnish drama film
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film by Timo Vuorensola is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
The sequel of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been at the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation also goes beyond Iron Sky 2, since the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's film and Tero Faramaa's film starts in October in Antwerp near AED Studios and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scared.
I've been really sick for a while!
I have such a relaxed manuscript because I know exactly what kind of film should come from.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to be shown to the audience in this movie, she tells the newspaper.
Initially, the film budget was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the manuscript developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big pile too.
However, 100 million could be spent on the film, as each corner of the picture and its effects are so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight that it's not loose at all.
The film’s production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond this Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate will be determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The trendsetters' breasts have recently decorated large logos.
Another time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a huppard or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a junta.
But times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as is often the case before, the line between funny and trendy is staggering: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the standard core trend, i.e. the fashion of fashion, in which the trendettes surprised by favoring as much boring basic clothing as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now you place on the top of the grey base collar instead of the top of the cabinet already buried on the top of the shirt, in front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas's identifiable trams, favorite team game shirts and New York Yankees have made a return ticket.
The edges of the jeans are starting to mock the Calvin Klein logos of the alkatris are now cool details.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the chest of Versace’s censors makes it clear what sign of clothing is involved.
Would you be ready to present your logos while you're wearing them?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I haven't been stuck in the tank for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, the leading producer of Russian war industry products, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media have spread colorful arguments that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove large-scale Zotovian tankers for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook pages, he published a picture where he seems to be looking at the impact of a armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, on the basis of those images, it is not a question of getting stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start by saying that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've served in the Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out in peace. Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's TV channel Zotov expressed his admiration at the exhibition's new technology in Russia because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I loved our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I'm absolutely going to go to all the tanks and all the assault wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the typewriter who wrote about it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and I came out.
I'm tall and rotting, but nothing like that that I'd be stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba's novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photograph of the alleged arrest has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show during a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Blonot.ru case, where Zotov was told about his poaching out of the tank when he tried and finally threatened to shoot everyone around him, unless he gets caught.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up issue in which the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
All they're used to is the soldiers jumping out of the armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company, has had a leak.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from its so-called rich-shine basin.
According to the company, measures have been initiated to correct the leakage.
The pool contains neutralised enriching water and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped for re-use as process water or directed through the surface treatment field to the environment in accordance with the permit.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak furnace meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The other ingredients did not flow to the environment.
The bleeding was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been found to cause leakage to the dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danken Kuuppaski: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation struggled with structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the entire contractual system and in the case of unemployment insurance.
Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuuppainen says that structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of positive message from the government's action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be too cut.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, which Kuoppamäki says to the Economic Survey.
In the IMF's view, the growth projects would also be useful if they were to be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danke predicts today in his new economic forecast that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention could be paid to industry's weakened confidence or to other so-called softer meters.
However, there is only a small percentage of the decimals involved.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who was working under Satoru Iwata for cancer, started her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told us on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata responded to the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as potential successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow the footprints of Iwata, and is assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is seen to be to strongly involve Nintendo in mobile games, but so that it does not eat bread on the company's traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are coming to Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country have disappeared every year.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens News have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kandelama, Director of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is Finland the same situation?
How much of the applicants disappear "under" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made in Finland for asylum of a minor who arrived alone.
They're missing 9.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the course of the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be of full age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, asylum seekers in Finland had a total of 3651, of which 134 had been declared to have disappeared because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from minors alone.
There are no overall statistics on minors who have lost this year, but therefore the number of minors has been known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons.
What happens to those who have made the translation decision?
Are they also lost, for example, to the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Office, since the implementation of the translation decisions is the responsibility of the police, the Court of First Instance stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered people in the country.
He's taken action on this.
Speaking at the EU's internal ministerial meeting on refugees' issues, Orpo spoke about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland on Monday.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the machines
Due to illness, the equipment used by Timo T.A., who lost his ability to work in the media sector, for the television and radio productions of Mikkonen, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment in Huuto.net, which at the time was one of the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The first news about the online notification was the online magazine of the Nightmakasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the hands of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are people who are interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but it is also necessary for as long as there is some old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and studio designers, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Stormland home.
We can't take all the goods with us at all.
I've started to invent, and I've been looking at what kind of stuff is being handed over.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TVs and radios.
It is clear from the rest of the brain attacks that a man who has made a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which representatives visited the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to prun away from what you think is worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to extend their power action to Friday's atmosphere.
The original plan was to set up metro and tram services only for the Friday noise.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether or not traffic stops for the whole day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says the body is large in the field.
The operations of the night and the tides extort the drivers badly, so the government plans to cut the castles raise opposition.
The point is, however, that the fact that traffic is growing all day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stand on Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
VR reports that trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
On Friday, there will be neither short-distance nor long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to the stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain in the pit.
The members of the ACP are away from work on Friday mornings on Saturday mornings at 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by a superior force, the HSL journalist Pirkko Repo guesses.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly which bus trains go on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a large-scale presentation at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11 a.m.-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled when panic took hold.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cans against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought the clock was a bomb.
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, 14 years old in Texas, is arrested after the teacher had his own clock bomb brought to school.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to present his electronic entertainment output.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and eventually the situation ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention centre on handcuffs.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished by three days of school compulsion.
His father's case is in his rage and the American-Islamic Council will consider whether the case is yet another proof of Islamophobia in the United States.
Great Britain - Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of monarchy.
The criticism expressed by the press that is calling for justice has also been endorsed by representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has insulted the people, estimated by Labour-Citizen Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last year’s Memorial celebrated the British Air Force’s fight against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends its official statement on Corbynia and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided labour lines.
Especially among the representatives of the people are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity and the increase in public expenditure.
Today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear for the first time as a party leader in this House in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask for.
Cameron was on Twitter for the weekend on Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister referred to in his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a legal case
South Lake Minnetonka Police have been investigating the family murder in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
Five families were found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family’s father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting a shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed himself in the house garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for a visit and found a huge house on the side of the Short family's death.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Houses and Successful Business
The investigation into the case of the South Lake Minnetonka chief of police Michael Siitar is still underway.
The motive of the blood vessels is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribunen, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've been made from the company's 50 offers of purchases over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in that the Short family bought a helpful house from Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of the car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribunen, however, the family's father was waiting for the court case.
The successful test prep, offering various pre-emptive courses, had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to the Success Test Prepin, Short's site had not removed any pre-emptive comments, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribunen, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Water Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner three was awarded the Finnish horse owner’s month prize at the victualling event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on his honor table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi, a successful horse coach, will be given complete peace of mind by Lori when working with the horse.

A wonderful gesture from the NHL star, "the greatest gift made by the athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal children's hospital.
According to the Health News, this is the largest single donation of all time made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens one year ago with eight years and 72 million dollars.
So the amount of Subban's donation is significantly greater than his nine million dollars a year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be named after the hospital’s lobby.
Canadiens players have previously made a significant contribution to local hospitals.
One year ago, Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s large hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife's dinner for a Japanese gift, serving simple bikinis and essays on top of her.
The teaspoons are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has goat's coffee, chicken's coffee, vampire's coffee, shrimp's coffee and now a wife's coffee.
It strikes the lonely, the crowds and the hungry.
That's what the Metro news was about.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome (My wife) café, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the client's spouse.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is opposed to just an essay and a bikini on top, the husband again in tight cycling shorts.
The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the candidates for a wife’s pension to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Almost 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against vehicle security began to equip themselves.
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as reported in the Intel release.
The panel consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of the best cyber security practices.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB findings.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60-75 % of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and we must improve the cyber security of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
ASRB allows Intel to consolidate the best safety practices and to support the view that cyber security is a significant component in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as if the moon was rising.
At last, the car is also beginning to look at Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Thanks to Ford's new four-wheeled RS, its 2.3-litre 350-horse engine accelerates from 0 to 100 seconds in 4.7 seconds and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
There is also an interesting price in Finland, which is initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell us in the press.
The favourite brand Kia presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show – such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to take advantage of the ever-increasing street amateur market, is certainly more important than two new ones in Finland.
A new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, was created under the leadership of Sportage, is more circular than before.
The axis range and external measurements have become one inch here and the car cuts the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but has been added to 177 horsepower developed 1.6-litre turbo.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive to us in spring 2016.
Even before the year began to change, the new Kia Optimat will be available in our country.
Looking at the news, it doesn't look like it's changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher level equipment.
Optimums with 1.7-litre turbo-jet and 2.0-litre petrol engines are initially produced.
Next summer, the speed will accelerate when the Optimum GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, comes next to them.
At the same time, it will start selling Optima.
Chisu came back to the stage with a brave grind in the ravine.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life for Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neck opening in an electric dress.
The apartment presents a beautiful singer's belt.
The whole crown of gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three - year break, the mother’s singer has had the weight of pregnancy cut with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter fills a year soon.
The singer published his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back in front of the stage and the general public after a long break.
I've missed everything I've done about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release a new album in a couple of weeks and at the same time his fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if you can find my new record, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law's style will be astounding again.
The real-new beauty of Kim Kardashia gives the subject one after the other.
He presents his pregnant baby and his breast equipment freely in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in the United States, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian with his husband Kanye West.
Black mammary dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the colored bras under the dress when flashing.
The last time Kardashia was dressed in an amatsonian maternity home, she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The apartment was highlighted by the black superiors.
The third special maternity home is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy baby on display.
Hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted a quick idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about pure model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Although in the previous period you would have put up top designers’ homes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces who will compete for work with the bunkers.
On templates, there's rarely a place they can call a home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses stay their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, your loneliness may be intolerablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York may be asking for pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is bad.
The models want to do this because of the possibilities it offers, but they are flattered by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have some role.
But in the work of a model, you can also express yourself.
The models in Tory Burch's play last night.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks where designers will reveal their design design next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, presents the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
In a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band, Roope Salminen presents the band's founder, Antti Lautala.
The club was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but broke up with the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen's laughing.
I've never wanted to see the real Antti before, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's a good thing that I'm only learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make a human imitation.
The man who's shooting the Roope Salminen and the Dogs band doesn't have a role to play.
The Punk-manes come by their nature.
The stars, the stars, the punks of the program must have seen many foretastes, as has ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a little poop, but we always go full.
In the year 1993-2004, Tuukka Temose directed by Tuukka Temose, the leading actors in the beautiful film was released today.
The crowd of young actors who have become known to the public in the band are still quite unknown to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtata Tatu Sinisalo founded Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his coming pestilence yesterday evening, when he told us in Snapchat that he was secretly preparing his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published a photo of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to perform for the film.
Roope, seen before in the five and the leukapara, has agitated her face into chili cheeks, dyed her brown hair into black.
Psychologist: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or should I tell you at all?
There is no need to speak up, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and does not allow them to watch news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in their minds and distress, he says.
However, if the child has run into TV news photos of refugees or heard from elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones parents think he is afraid of.
The child should not be intimidated in vain, even if it bothers and scares himself.
A smaller child closely follows the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter the issue of refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents should talk to them about it if they think about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Together with children, parents can consider how our family is dealing with this.
In our view, however, is the world a safe place or a safe place in the end?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will get a model of how to deal with future problems in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help with weaker"
My powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Difficult to control with a vermo impact
Perttu Nordjola made the Apila Ballosalama shine in mid-summer.
It only ran out of victories and second-tiers until the end of July, when a collapse occurred in Tampere raves.
Since the ori became the root of the problem, the coach suspected something to be wrong and ordered the time of his protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the detonation came to light.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not from the mildest point of view, but the suppression of it required two courses of medicine.
As Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light sports, Pohjola tells us that she was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time, another SE dam after the Big Wind.
Apilan Pallosalama was very busy when it had been possible to drive normally only a few weeks.
Those things of attention to the small tendency at the end was understandable, Nohjola says.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made orre steel.
I am sure that the horse's hand went forward, and I hope that it would have been even.
Apilan Pallosalama has been known as humor horses.
After not having fun, it could have been thrown fat without disease.
Instead, on a good day, the ores have been released from such a smuggler that the opponents have been in wonder.
At short notice, the racers are unable to cope with the Pallosalama, from which even warm bloody tears can be removed.
The hopes of the north are that there will be a dry run in Vermo.
But the difference is how Apilan Ballosalama agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it's gonna be a lot of fun under the car's boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the Ori would be calmer than it was when Turku left.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bowl when it's in order, and we're going to drive with it for victory, coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of the vain iPhone software
CEO of Apple Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example FaceTime calls, press booth, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a compulsive update on iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple intelligent watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, because the company does not want to waste the memory of users using iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area declined to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by a fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised the 0.2% forecast slightly downwards from a few weeks ago.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate for the whole of the 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was 1.9 per cent lower than in the previous year.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised index.
Inflation in the euro area is still firmly far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a significant 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, the Central Bank anticipates its release at the beginning of September in its new inflation forecast.
U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its earliest in less than a year's time, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And on the financial markets, the downside begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rates may be starting already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next downturn can be pushed on at its fastest by the next autumn and as a price shift in the financial markets before it.
Or this will at least happen if the world's biggest economy and financial markets function as they have been used to - and if they react to the tightening of Fedi's cash flows as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's strategies for market research in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a comprehensive survey of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international big customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe they know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they present the facts of the economic statistics and their calculations of how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of the previous interest rates - and what they may be following.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more orderly state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
I don't think it's gonna be a year until the beginning of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy and the leaders who decide on its current establishment have all along the way last summer and early autumn suggested that time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate of over nine years can already be paid this week.
The matter will be resolved in the middle of the week and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a relatively regular but at the same time a small range of 0.25 percentage points of interest, with Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended just two years ago.
In 2007, the financial market was affected by the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis broke into a global judgment day nightmare.
The great recession began in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy oppositions began slower than has typically occurred since the former Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were then harder and harder than the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsches' strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the reversals of financial markets since 1950 and places from the early 1800s onwards.
Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact have been clear since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession is at its earliest rate of under one year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The price increase in the financial market has ended within the period of the year to two years from the start of Fedi's interest rates.
In turn, Fed has increased and reduced its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen cycles.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the review is relatively limited, and therefore it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies, therefore, point out that this time there are many things different.
And not just better.
Interests too low too long
The reasons for the financial crisis, if not the guilty, do not necessarily come to light even with decades of research work.
But three aspects of the causes of the crisis and of its devastating effects seem to be somewhat clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world's largest central banks kept their interest rates too low.
They set the traces of the techno-cube and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased even higher than in the past because of the excessive monetary policy impact of the central banks.
It was the biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy.
3) In particular, the almost bulky, packaged, crazy debt financing boosted most of the financial market components until then the biggest price bubbles in economic history from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly the case that the financial markets, which have risen to heights with more complicated bonds, were rarely dangerous and unstable, and when Fed and the other central banks were the last to push interest rates upwards.
The financial structures of the debtors, rather than the valuation bubbles, did not last until after the interest rate had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis, and there was a great recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsches strategis do not guess what will happen next, but they give rise to the subject of fate by, for example, mentioning the following points:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been a crazy thing like ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy is not reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the burden of debt is much heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former and cheaper central banks has largely remained on the financial market and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets most expensive since the peak or at any time before the financial crisis.
Neither are the strategies of the Latin atmosphere only with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession of decades to the model that has taken place before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is abnormally weak, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when the next Fed is tightening up its financial flows.
Perhaps the French bank Societe Generale’s future picture of Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has already trained the bank's international investor clients for the following translations:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial shocks break, and soon it's time for Fedin to rush to shut down the financial blocks with even bigger QE-money shots.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), who manufactures computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed at HP’s Business Services, the company explains.
HP is divided into HP Inc., a PC and printer company focused on business sales in November Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumers.
The number of HP staff was highest in 2011, at which time it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The consumer side's reductions will remain to 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In another year, 65 per cent of the profit was brought by its three largest customers.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the government of the tax paradise company
According to Yle, Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax paradise company.
Moreover, the company's activities are linked to so-called tax planning.
It is the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he left the notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a notice of divorce.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs is managed by the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflorin in 2012.
Berner served in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
Moreover, Kährs’ holdings go through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted the membership of the Luxembourg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was applied for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I found that my job was to take care of the capital benefits of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of the capital of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership has nothing to do with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure built on tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the Triton capital fund, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is opening a reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre run by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from tonight from six.
Within a week, the number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former University of Rescue.
Luona Oy maintains its operations, with a particular focus on the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree together on the Centre's security arrangements.
STTK prepares an alternative labour-intensive package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package for the government's labour pressures.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee center organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's expression of spirit.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the meeting of the organization’s administration on a break to the journalists.
Instead, Palola estimates that there is no willingness for discussions in the Central Economic Union (EC).
The STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I do not know whether there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of one side if there is one relationship with one hundred.
Palola: The dialogue was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a relationship between the government and the government, and it has been constructive about him all the time.
According to Palola, the operation of the Sundays is a painful place.
The system requires the government to withdraw from the binding legislation that it would be implementing part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, Palola does not intend to prepare the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work-force package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their minds and have not been the object of the strike.
Acavan Fjäder Thanks
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder, thanked the STTK for the announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming to the same lines with Akava, since Akava has already developed an alternative model for the government's proposals for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK, the package will not be comprehensive enough.
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolan STTK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want security of change and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long prepared its own presentation, ready to negotiate a 5% competitiveness rating for the country's government as an alternative to surgery.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava's lines, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers, Fjäder says.
Ava's Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the fire," "playing bingo when Sipilä talks tonight."
Green Left of Tampere University
The Green Left in the University of Tampere, Viva's bingo coupon for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen canal on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the Prime Minister's previous speech, the Prime Minister must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister holding the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and ministers held several radio talks during the winter and postwar period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a speech instead of a new year's speech to President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike by train drivers on television.
Lone calls, multi-archy meinkins
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and guess what to do all day.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated that "Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the dialogue has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Judges of the SDP condemned the "multi-archist measure: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilä dialogue: "A half a year of elections.
No presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's an attempt.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented on by direct mail from the president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the CEO of the EK, Jyri Hämäman.
It's been a lot of criticism of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote the comprehensive public service of Finland as a whole, as well as the Ylen publication director Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
It's like us at Tammelos.
The speech has also given rise to irritability.
In the evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be hoarded and put on their best clothes.
My mom's gonna put on the brightest third and my dad's gonna settle the tie's neck.
At 9 a.m., they silenced on television like before the ancient Me Tammeloi," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also asks why the Finnish Government is sitting in its tax havens, hiding its capital's millions, which are creating mercy laws for other taxmakers and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut out when the government is out of money?" Pia Lohikoski asks.
One estimate of what Sipilä says is presented by the green left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It's been published on Facebook, along with the bingo.
Can we hear about the same boat tonight, about common coal, about living in debt, about team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Area.
Ahtisaari Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to exclude al-Assad
The Western countries more than three years ago rejected Russia’s offer to give up the power of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, says President Marti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the UN Ambassador to Russia proposed a plan for Al-Assad to leave power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not adhere to the proposal because they thought Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed the three-point plan: the opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and al-Assad were immediately forced to get a speech and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be put into effect with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that you should sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats No Comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he passed on the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr Thurk did not confirm the content of the debate in the paper, but according to the Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said Al-Assad's troops had already committed several mass murders at that time and key opposition groups refused all the agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, views the Ahtisaari speech with hesitation because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point about Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
In that case, according to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's turn to hold power with a supporter of al-Assad.
Refugee flow into our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahtisa Islands, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum-seekers' organisation centre in Tornio
The asylum-seekers organisation centre planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in the city centre in the empty building of Tornio.
The Ministry of the Interior has looked for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Declaration announced that the council had already decided to present the school building as a solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinenen (left), Vice President of Tornio City Council, it is not true.
When the whole council was not in the process of meeting, and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council to decide on it next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
There were 13 members of the system's headquarters who were opposed.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision will be positive, Skipper says.
According to city director Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday and was quickly responded to.
There could be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of meters from the border, so it would also be working in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) the public halving of holiday money would only take care of part of the government's labour cost reduction.
However, the government would be happy to accept the alternative package if the social partners managed to agree on it.
Mr Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for alternatives to the pressures of the government's announced work life.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will certainly gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
Halving holiday money would be a way of working for Sipilä, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned Sunday surgery.
Labour market organisations could agree on a reduction in the amount of holiday money, since it has been entered in collective agreements instead of in the law.
On this occasion, the government will report to the Parliament next week on the pressures of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the end of the back line either.
Legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become harder and harder all the time.
It's been a long time.
Not long, if there is will, in such matters, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the government includes, among other things, the conversion of the unemployed and men's home to unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of illness will be cut, overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past the unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of this action, the employee centre organisations organise a large-scale protest on Friday, and several trade unions have also issued political decrees.
Tohmajärvi Council approved an expansion of the mahogany warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the mahalli warehouse.
The criticism caused the project to be bigger and more expensive than had originally been said.
Also a busy schedule excitedly.
Even that little wonderd that the need for space was not known one year ago when it was decided on the previous enlargement.
At this stage, an expansion of 400-450 square metres to the investment programme was adopted, but the money will be decided upon in the context of the interim report.
The next item was the EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000 investment, but the Technical Director, Mr Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (p.).
In Joensuu, the place for the language of Karelia
The city government eased its position to bring the street signs of cattle to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right sense, the election of the cattle tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself to be the capital of the language of cattle, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of cattle is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more a part of Eastern Savoles.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs in the centre of the city.
However, the city of Joensuu is prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use the language of cattle, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the language of the cattle now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still unique in the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of them can be of great use in the multi-pronged marketing of the province.
The closure of rail connections reduces the vitality of the province
The operation of train connections will impact the province's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region's economic life and competitiveness.
And it does affect whether you can live and work here at all, because the city director of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been included on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole region that we cannot afford to be reduced by government measures, as is currently happening.
The impact of these closures on employment, for example, should be looked at.
The decline in traffic links is a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services available here, such as transport connections and housing, is the easier to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He pointed out that poor traffic links also had an impact on the research community, which was very mobile and travelled a lot for research purposes.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that the marketing of the university towards Western Finland is difficult already at the moment, because traffic connections are in a cross-sectional direction.
Currently, about half of students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10 to 20% are from the New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of my warriors for the war of Siun
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the provincial Siun war project seems to be unanimous, but there is even one of my sorcerers.
At a Monday meeting, the city government member Pentti Kessalo (ed., pictured) presented the whole project to the government, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of the Mayor of Kari Kareliainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotva to Kouvola ends next year
The passenger train traffic from Kott to Kouvola will remain even in the future, even though there are fewer train drivers.
There will be changes in the passenger train segment between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains will be gone, but still five days later they will reach Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government savings measures.
For the next four-year period, the purchase of train traffic by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will set new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one of them couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The rescue agency released a 12-year-old who could not get off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at Tornioinen on the Ketotie side of the road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent a bunch of boys who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mast of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others were busy and the passers-by alarmed the rescue facility to help the betkeepers safely return to the surface of the land.
FedEx's net sales vary, lower outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx released its last quarter's weak results. The transport sector was experiencing a year-round decline in its forecast of demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company intends to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year FedEx announced that it will hire 50 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx’s forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial period ending May. The forecast is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
According to factset's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has decreased, on average, despite the 4.9% increase in prices. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. Additional charges on large-scale shipments will enter into force in November.
The company is still expecting revenue from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and increased online trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has performed in a very expected weaker economic situation, which has been particularly affected by production and global trade.
The seasonal employee pay plans were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000-95,000 people.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx’s operating profit amounted to $692 million, which represents an increase of 6%.
The share-by-share result was $2.42, which means that the forecast for the 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research was $2.44.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international first-class broadcasts, which has led to a downsurge in the operations of the company's Express unit.
The strong growth of online commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance were reflected in the operating profit.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic fees, while the return on freight business fell due to higher labour costs.
About one hour before the opening of the actual trade, the FedEx share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock decreased by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent from the highest rating recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision makers of the US Central Bank's Fed meet at a more anticipated meeting for years. The crowd sits at the eight-metre diameter of the Honduran wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
On the wall of a decorative, double - floor meeting room of the Central Bank, a wall painting of the United States is handsome.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, has to put the financial interests of the state ahead of all other interests.
Keskuspank has a double order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the Great Depression, the management of the Central Bank has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece for a thin decision. On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start a withdrawal from the unforeseen irritation, which has been offered by the last few short interest rates which have remained close to zero in 2008.
Although most data indicate a steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in the financial markets can already be completed with caution by central bank officials fearing an increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even in a quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important factors in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty on the global market will give enough reason to wait for it," Piegza continues.
They disagree with what the central bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economy's study by Bloomberg was about to rise interest rates this week.
In the financial markets, however, it is estimated that the Central Bank is expecting a rise of only 30%, according to the key indicator.
If the central bank raises its interest rate, the stock prices can be calculated unless the decision-makers soft the impact by promising another raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The background for the growth was expectations that the central bank will keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, the main economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage," he said.
"If this happens, the Central Bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of those in the financial markets unsettled."
Another expert pointed out that by raising interest rates, financial markets could be calmed and uncertainty removed as to when the central bank was operating.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to be paying more attention to raising interest rates of 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening up the financial situation and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
It has been found throughout the spring and early summer that interest rates have been rising this year – despite the fact that Liberals believe that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now lowest in seven years and close to the level which the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wages seem to be stimulating
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was a temporary impact on oil prices.
"The situation can be better off with higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take account of the tight labour market situation," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the global financial market did not shock last month , when China devalves its currency .
Dow Jones’ industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the May record and investors feared that China’s economic downturn would also have an impact on global growth.
This month's market has been invigorating, and Dow Jones has already fallen by almost 10 per cent from peak readings in May.
The turmoil of the markets means that the central bank's decision-makers will be more complicated to consider the increase in the interest rate.
"The work of the Central Bank will be complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estaat Senior Investigator and former Central Bank official Stephen D. Oiner.
He now believes that the Central Bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the recent developments in the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The consolidation of the global economy is not the main concern of the Central Bank, and should therefore not in principle affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most influential force in the world's monetary system.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, just a hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the Central Bank could reduce the extent of its activities led to revolutions around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The Central Bank's decision-making process is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Chief Financial Officer for Envestnet Inc's Global Strategy.
The President of the Regional Bank of Jeffrey Lacker Richmond said this month that the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem not to be linked to the pillars of the economy.
Member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), who is entitled to vote, has called for an increase in the interest rate and has set an example in the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to reduce the steering rate of 0.75 percentage points, even though there were only limited identifiable penalties for US economic growth," Lacker said.
One year later, the Central Bank repealed the decision.
"The Central Bank should put financial stability first only in a significant crisis, such as the 2008 financial collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Interest Committee.
The latest whirlwind does not even approach the situation at that time," he said.
"It is no good to fear the rise of the race because of the shock of the market," added Posen, the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability, and before this changes, I do not think I should go ahead of things."

Rio Grande Children’s Association in Brazil promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blinding approach to teaching women who are breast-feeding about the importance of a proper diet, presenting pictures of babies who are breast-fed with unhealthful food images.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby receives all the food she needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calories, other changes in diet should be made.
The recent research by Professor Robert Waterland of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise's top spectators, even though Nine's trying to catch the lead at the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like to thank Canberra for his morning programme for the election of the Liberal leadership, which, however, did not greatly improve the attendance of Today.
The Nine Canal morning program was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull's disbanded Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage’s competitive morning program, for their part, was broadcast from London. Special weekly broadcasts are also being broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance did not have any relevance for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise viewed an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, and today's programme as 339 000 viewers.
The number of viewers in the city rose slightly from 317,000 on Mondays and Tuesdays (283,000) to 343,000 last Thursday.
Today has caught up with the distance to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 spectators, or 330,000 on Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The changes in the winds will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The remarkable innovation Seven had a 800 Words series with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novel drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have doubts as to whether Thomson's hit series would be enough alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the ratings last night, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor held a strong position with 1 136 000 viewers. The series clearly defeated The Block (838 000) and the TBL Familiens series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has held viewers alternately.
On average, the first half-hour of the new show by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30) followed 446 000 viewers.
In the second half of the hour (17.30–18.00), the number of spectators rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (63,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australian’s first half had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half collected an enormous 720,000 viewers.
The number of Hot Seat viewers was 620,000.
The viewers of The Chase Australia's second night showed the Nine Channel that Hot Seat will pass another 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced a million dollar minute that couldn't challenge the McGuire series.

The final three think Sam Wood really is the Son of Dreams — but who is the man who chooses?
Was the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeawart-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unintentionally revealed the choice of the dream boy.
The final choice of dreamer Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
Three of the remaining women did not sweat the word of who received the last rose from the boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeont-Fellows about the atmosphere before one of the triangles was dropped off.
Sam Wood's lips have been tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women felt that Wood was a perfect man. Women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considered him a suitable partner in his qualities.
When a woman was asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the last rose were not found at her own point, their answers may give an indication of who will take the boy’s heart.
Jevont-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay himself the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all been easy from the start.
"As soon as I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well suited to each other. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," Jeves-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and he's really funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks herself and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized last week's hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I am now making a big contribution to our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if a man would not choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting a NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne, who moved to the United States, and several other associations were also interested in the man after the last year's impressive open day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the selection shows a touch button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as was the case with the man in the ranks of the Australian rugby team. Hayne sold the flight kick back to the team on Tuesday at 20–3 reading from Minnesota.
Tomsula, however, showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new opportunity to return the flight. The coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued in the suit after the game.
He didn't crawl into the crowd, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed arrest and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne sets off the unattainable, Minnesota Vikings against the first quarter of the game played.
Hayne and his Australian fan corps had been waiting for another man from the NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These happen, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne made a comparison of his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his feed in his own area opened the place for Queensland.
Overall, however, the experience was incredible for 27-year-olds.
Hayne published a photo on Instagram, where he presents together with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the threat of an airport in Siberia.
Openly challenged by President Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, the man-owned oil company Jukos was expelled and his work in defence of democracy was restricted.
Four dead cops fired at the rubber bullets in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the state's source reported on Wednesday, and the police fired a crowd on the rubber bullets in a protest against the alleged new constitution in the country, and there was a four-year-old son among the victims.
The violence happened on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, just less than three hundred kilometres from the capital Kathmanda.
According to Bishop Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire extinguishers.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and set fire to the air before shooting the rubber bullet.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why the rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered less destructive as an alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in the protests of weeks in the southern states of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent violence since 10 August,
the four major political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, which is an important step towards the new Constitution, but which is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been in force since 2008, but legislative speeding up the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake of April.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmanda this week and the new Charter could be adopted by the authorities by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From the vast area of the lowland about 560 kilometres from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands, 60 percent of the probability of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Aerial Science Institute, the centre of a clear low - pressure compound is also located in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It is also 60 percent likely to develop into a tropical cyclon during the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced its launch of a campaign to raise $11 million in humanitarian aid for humanitarian organisations across Europe to help thousands of people flee from war and poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading, Google’s employee Rita Masoud started the campaign by telling about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the crisis in refugees and migrants in Europe, many families in the same situation are badly in need of help.
Donations are given to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organization.
When donations have been collected from google.com/refugereleief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate a corresponding amount, bringing the total amount to $11 million.
The European refugee crisis is then the worst in World War II, and the situation is worsening, in particular, the civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people fleeing their homes this year.
The war will also have to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mild overweight type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after a obesity surgery than those receiving an unoperative treatment.
"Getting death data takes time," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who was working on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Muscle surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach volume by various methods.
Surgical methods reduce the sense of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective form of treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have involved overweight patients with a weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length of the normal value 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is over 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, bypass surgery and squamous surgery, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in mildly fat subjects.
After the muscle surgery, the average weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth research year.
The weight index for those who received non-operative treatment was maintained at 29 °C.
Patients treated for surgery had a total improvement of 36% and a partial improvement of 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved by only 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgery group.
The researchers also monitored the patient’ s haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect the development of blood glucose.
According to the researchers, the recommended level of haemoglobin-A1c is less than 7%.
Following surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased on average from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained stable at around 8%.
However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over the past five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, in the gastrointestinal bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the squamous surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight index loss was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), while in the surgery group diabetes also improved completely (46.9% and 16.7 %).
The new study failed to show a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study in Blackstone, Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery provides years of life for fat people.
In the Swedish study, fat people who were undergoing a stomach bypass surgery were reduced by 29 per cent compared to the traditional treatment group during the 15 years.
However, despite the absence of a lower mortality rate in the new study, Blackstone stated that it could benefit from the measure if persons with a weight index of less than 35 were confirmed.
"This is the most important finding in the study, as it states that surgery is safe in the lower weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We are waiting too long for people to take the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When a person's body has undergone genetic changes that expose him to obesity and diabetes, turning things into a situation is really difficult."
"Not everything can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during her visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity should be placed above individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible to think that everything could come to Europe", the Dalai-Lama said in his speech.
Although thanking Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"Finally, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
The powers never solved any problems," he added.
When talking about violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States produced an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the 11th of September attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come about through non-violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he relied on the means of force that had unpredictable consequences," said Dalai-lama.
Hand-in-hand swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years
Georgia's Centre for Toxicity reports that in children under 12 years of age, almost four times as many as in children aged 12 years and over, with a strong alcohol content in the United States, have been reported by poisoning centres across the United States since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the reported cases of handcuff swallowing reported to poison centres in children under 12 years of age in Georgia increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children will be given first aid," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink gloves deliberately, part to impress their friends and part of the social media excited.
The YouTube video shows teenagers drinking disinfectants because of low-cost hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic mouth water with a disinfectant to make a stronger drink.
Smaller children can attract the smell of handcuffs.
"The child does not think that the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of the attractive handmade products has just been smelled.
You can also buy strawberries, grapes and oranges with tasteful handcrafts that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of babies can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the handcuffs is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Toxication Centre, told the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskeys in the reach of children, but if hand disinfectants are often left in the reach of children, they will quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four sloppy strawberries hands at school, and the girl was sent to take care of her first aid.
"The alcohol content of a woman's blood was 179, which is twice as high as that of an adult," says Dr. Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah died and couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
The doctors followed the girl’s condition overnight in a separate children’s hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol,” Ritchey said.
"Your place was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortor Scott told CNN.
My daughter could've died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, in addition to transferring your hand to children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died by swallowing hands containing a non-reported toxic substance.
Although the latter has been reported as an active substance in the product leaflet, the health authorities considered that the killing of methanol instead of ethyl alcohol contained in the product.
According to the police report, three four - grade students in the northern part of the state of New York planned in January to kill the "wrong" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handcuffs and denied to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the past plan was irrelevant and called for discipline to be taken.

The first half-time penalty imposed on Aberdeen a little victory on Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen’s five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths is deploring the words of disconcerting
Griffiths has ignored rumours about the contradiction in Celtic lines. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under observation when preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure.
The Dutch need an old Scottish pair of battles – de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and the Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have found that Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has ceased because they no longer have to follow Celtic and Rangers' doubles.
De Boer, a member of the Ajax team, said: "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just Rangers' return that we're talking about here.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch are in need of a double fight between the teams.
Old Firm's games have enormous excitement, and they're also interesting outside the Scottish borders."
I'll turn it around, Delia convinces me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian nature assures us that the situation will change.
The lost club of Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has five points in the lead at the table.
"Celtic's had some tough episodes before, and we're gonna get up again," Delia said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it arouses anger or sorrow in many people.
We do, too, but we have to keep moving forward.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, because it strengthens players considerably.
The common spirit is really important now."
Warburton Careful in January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton suggested January's player transfer points, he is cautious about the transfer box and says that he wants to jeopardise the unity of the team.
"The transfers of players in January differ significantly from the summer shifts," said former coach Brentford.
"Summer-related players will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has succeeded this season in our composition.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player purchases can cause more harm to the team than benefits."
Michu, who is thinking about retirement in the direction of Celtic
Swansea's attacker Michu has been associated with Celtic's player transfer talks, and Michu, on the other hand, has suggested retirement after the Swans agreement has ended.
For years, Michu, a 29-year-old, has been a hostile ankle, and he has not succeeded in getting a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts Ready for SFA Fighting Neilson's Comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2 red card of the defenseman was later cancelled. This is already the third collection red card within eight months, which is cancelled.
But Neilson stays behind his words. "I didn't question the honesty. I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastlea
Griffiths were reprimanded when he admitted that he had been blaspheming songs from former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the Edinburgh Roseburn area pub before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight, and the atmosphere was intense," said the attacker. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except in Celtic's ranks."
Tannadice Management Group believes in Dundee United Coaching Management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's management team can turn the situation into better.
"Stepen Thompson believes in us.
We're getting boys ready for battle," Donnelly said.
McInnes is satisfied with the Hamilton win with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate for Hamilton to win his seventh consecutive league victory. With victory, Aberdeen caught a five-point neck at the top of the Celtic series table, which is to thank Adam Rooney for his punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Isle
The number of employed persons remained unchanged in Scotland in May to July. The number of unemployed persons is 164,000. In the UK as a whole, the number of unemployed persons grew by 10 000.
According to the United Kingdom Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate was 5.9% in Scotland, while it was 5.5% throughout the United Kingdom.
In Scotland, the number of employed persons is 12 000 less than three months earlier, and now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter. The UK average employment rate is 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term plan of the administration has created a basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for the revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklaphoma State penalty prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the true story of the death penalty.
The angle of view would be unique.
Journalists will be able to track executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants will be selected with macabre value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of suppliers from 12 to five.
You selected to follow the execution in a moderate manner.
I can't do it.
I sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends. I’ve created a man’s personal relationship, because we’ve talked on the phone several times over the months, and one visit took me two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in the character of both the witness and the reporter, so I must not include a notebook and pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try and push the details into my mind.
I was accused on Twitter of endangering impartiality by a Danish journalist.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell him a damn story in a pleasant way, you get close to him."
I presented a different opinion to the journalist.
She admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still considered my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't determine what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't do it.
I have told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what has happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity contributes to the motion against the death penalty.
The journalist Kim Bellware from Huffington Post will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information about this, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I am not going to repeat the details here.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would make him responsible for helping him after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
The unencumbered description can be read in the files of other suppliers.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
A man was lured from Canningjoe after a watery police hunt
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry, attracting a man up from the Canning River.
An escape attempt by a Perthian man was taking place in low, mesmerized waters, and a few metres away a police officer was able to land a man on a dry land.
Canning Vale's police got a call on Tuesday from an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
After reaching the site, the police discovered a suspect who tried to get rid of the police's position by pointing to the Canning River.
But the man couldn't get far.
"A man standing in the water said that he was not coming out of the water and asked the police to go and get him," said older Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to watering the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"Otherwise, the escape attempt makes a person rely on amusing ways," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police noise and tried to swim across the Swanjoe River.
The man's attempt was doomed to destruction, but the trick inspired the locals to plan Ben Cousins' biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the journalists tried to spy, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's suppliers of spying business of being deposited last year. He threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the journalists and Racing Victoria's integrity department have personally attacked her, and the rejection of Lady Tatain because of the treatment recently given on the race day was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to work for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found cobalt and he could not explain the discovery.
Moody has held his tongue for a period of one and a half years on spy charges, and he did not want the accusations to seem like a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to raise the matter. I was thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration goes down with a kick," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well my night.
I want the horses to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to go on as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the integrity department's spying efforts in his warehouse.
"Four years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my store for the purpose of spying on my actions. I tell him the name of the man when asking for it," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught by anything unauthorized.
The former President of RVL Robert Roulston, the current President of RVL David Moodie and the current CEO of RVL Bernard Saundry were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal pursuit?
Should RVL take real action and take responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-trainers?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I really a bad guy in the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think that way.
Maybe I'll still be a training license and push me away from my duties, no doubt that I'm making many people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm going to pressure them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
For a long time, the investigation of Lidar’s cobalt values and your recent rejection made the coach feel frustrated in the end by threatening to give up his license.
Moody is best known for being the coach of the unattainable champion Black Caviar. He described the race day treatment rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been set against the rules of clay.
"The treatment is contrary to the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person who belonged to my family wrongly put clay on the horse's foot.
I could have done the clay treatment last night.
It could've been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can wait for a three-month ban on anti-salt treatment, which the organisers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a cyclist in the weekend, a man who ran away from the crash site.
The biker was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter, and he suffered serious injuries from a car crash on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police say that the man who was driving the car fled the scene and was not left to help the injured cyclist.
A man from Nathalia, 50 years old, registered with the Shepparton Police.
People are likely to expect charges of failure to stop and assist in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy points out the challengers
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm regards his team's chess game as a critical task for the NRL's two leagues.
According to Coach Trent Robinson of Sydney Roosters, the judges let Storm press into the trouble of Melbourne's hosts in a shortcoming game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Wayne Bennett of Brisbane Broncos easily covered the reference to Storm Broncos in the winning karsintan finals of Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model game and said that Queensland did not care more about the press.
Bellamy defended his own team's game of jacking and said they were just focused on contacting when the jacking.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that two top team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as evidence that coaches worry about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes out. I remember Trent Robinson didn't talk about it when his team won us 24–2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense system or in our techniques all year round.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he has a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always arises at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne speaks of an interesting football match.
He compared his own team on Saturday with our Friday game and thought their game was interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St Georgea got a lot of criticism from his boring game. Wayne said that a review doesn't take him any time.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast central player.
That kind of football wants to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his style. Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I'm getting more confidence in this when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're turning to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that in the Storm and Roosters game more paintings were made than when seeing Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven’t seen it, but what was the result? 16–12?
The result of our game was 20–18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the slots and the minority interesting football?
I think it's interesting to see goals.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit either North Queensland Cowboys in Cronu at Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed against $200,000 guarantees in the drug case
A man in possession of a 40 kilos worth of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released from a life-long sentence against $200,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men who were arrested last month by a police officer after finding a hundred kilos of cocaine from the Solay Valley, who had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
The police watched the meetings with Maksimovic and his criminal partner boating for the morning day and then surprised them at the two later Coomera Roadhouse café, where they found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car at the parking lot.
Although Maksimovic possibly expects to have a lifetime of possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to a man’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his client tried to take over the whole batch, but he could have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic has clear connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
The mother and stepfather of Paysimovic paid 200,000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the election certificates of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But it is not enough alone to prevent a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and stays at home from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the paedophiles to send her pictures.
The pedophile used a girl's phone at the age of 11 to get pictures of the abuse of children.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while sleeping and logged in to the online communication service where she got another user to send herself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when the girl woke up, she noticed the phone went missing, and she found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she explained her phone contents, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police, and the computers found at the address they found found disturbing Internet searches using search terms to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed that he tried to mislead the paedophiles on the Internet and presented the police with a view to scaring the paedophiles.
Prosecutor Eiladh Robertson, at the Dundere Sheriff Court at the local court, stated: "Mies claimed to be addicted to human fear.
He admitted that he had committed a grave on a computer, but claimed that he did so to act as a police officer and thus to scare the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent him pictures and who Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he got disturbing thoughts when he was drinking and that he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl cried out to her mother with shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, after which Hogg was questioned.
She told me that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked significantly younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed the charges against the possession of inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his guarantee against 25 January this year and failed to arrive for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not be entered in the sexual criminal register, since it can be considered that there were no significant sexual features involved in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the judgment to October due to background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted an exemption against guarantees in this case, but he was held in detention on other grounds.
Hogg was added to a record of sexual offences even before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is making the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell in the stairs leading to the talker boom earlier this year.
Mugabe did not get hurt, but a video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
Parliament’s open-ended members also shadowed allegations by the opposition party’s legislators that they have received anonymous killings warning them not to confiscate Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the representatives of the people were bulging and interrupting the speech in Parliament on the state of the President's state, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) Piistur Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages inviting them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message's title is "death", Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The communication warns recipients that representatives outside the Parliament are no longer in the circle of immunity.
The party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of business services restructuring and savings measures.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will dissociate computer and printing operations from more rapidly growing business equipment and service operations.
According to HP's bulletin, the company is recording the one-off cost of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"Restructuring enables a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who leads the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move to a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to the mission.
The company, founded by the University of Stanford's educators Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s, is now divided into two companies.
Massive restructuring has been carried out in HP when traditional desktop computers are being moved to mobile devices.
The changes in HP, which is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world, and in the US's largest technology companies, are the latest move in the area that is believed to bring success.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes through the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss out on at least the following four national team games in England. The hours of man's history his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The most unfortunate of the last problem is that Wilshere decided to leave the last season after a severe ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade during the new period.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"It didn't get any better.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to her ankles or to previous injuries."
Medically it may be this way, but as Wenger also pointed out, additional injuries may occur when the player tries to return to the field between the season.
This must also be seen as an unpleasant rule of law.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played a total of 157 league games in the Arsenal ranks in the last five years.
The larger picture of Arsenal is that since 2007–2008, six out of eight teams have been the second most injured teams.
Wenger accepts the possibility of witchcraft, but Arsenal believes that last season's improved injury statistics will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Some time after the injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time when we need to strengthen the body and apply for competitive power," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body balanced. I believe in it, and with it his career continues as it deserves."
Arsenal will start the Mestarie league's career on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday. Wenger will prepare for small changes to the composition.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put the initial composition in place of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team balance and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite F-group successor, Maximummir Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games on the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the earth shook with force on the 3,2 Richter scale.
The break-up was 10th this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson last season after he had to bow to Monaco, and he also continues to be motivated by a far-reaching desire to join the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy launch," Wenger said.
"As far as Arsenal is concerned, we haven't hit this title yet.
On the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men
It is worth noting, in particular, that the need for men to open up is greater than ever, and the suicide statistics for young men are at most 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 the year of men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
The recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students who are more likely to recover from depression if they have enough healthy people around them.
In addition, the incidence of ill-disease among the symptomless was halved if they were close to individuals with no mental health problems.
But everything is based on friendships.
Modern communication dominates social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast reaction is often considered to be more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need for a strong, fun and successful doubles, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all taken into account by internal values and by our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. The inner values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money really cannot buy happiness.
The Fréndie's fineness was that the series turned its main focus.
None of the characters in the series were defined according to the profession, but the personality.
Joey and Chandler were humorously presented in the series, hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often in need of Rachel. It was clear that men could identify themselves with this, even if they didn't stop feeling full.
One volunteer worker explained this to me: "When I heard people who were depressed and think about suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be well is strong. Man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frandit is one of the areas where long-term survival mechanisms are put forward.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Through the phone I can offer help from outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support is obtained from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series of sets have been revived, so if you take part in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to the coffee shop in Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – to honor #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating a goal against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the finish in the Master League debyyt and helped PSG hit the Swedish team on Tuesday in Malmö.
Read the game report and assessment.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started his work at the Champions League by hitting the Parc des Princes in Malmö on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in handing. PSG however hit several country flags before finally being able to increase his lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A-block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG does not only want to continue in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarter gap in three remaining games.
Although the SPG caught up with the points, the match was not the perfect show for the team shot by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his spot and the man was replaced by his former home club, where he started a great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions' League at home or in guests, so the 2–0 win and good picks give us a good basis, even though we still have to be disappointed for the season," Blanc said.
"This knows well.
We wanted to win and we could do it, but I'm sorry that we couldn't make one or two extra goals."
After being injured, Ibrahimovic returned to the team. During the weekend, the team had to settle for the 2nd and 2nd games against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his shadow for four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian platformer moved from Manchester United to PSG lines was named the PSG, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the name when he attacked the ball from Marco Verratt's feed past Malmö's defense and then fired a sharp goal at Johan Wiland's back.
However, those who were expecting the PSG to be crushed were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the fall games, marched to the field with nine international level players since the start. The five men’s defense and two attackers’ tactics were difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shooting went slowly past Kevin Trappi's goal in 34. minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, and the least Ibrahimovic who lost five goals only in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick entered Cavani.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his fingernails in the game. Ibrahimovic’s game, Di Maria, shot a spin by Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the Count's time thanks to Cavan. A six-time-old Uruguayan shot a full-blown summary when Ibrahimovic fed him a left-hand swinger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's blackmail ended in the second goal, and only from the distance from Wiland's peak fight against David Luz's shooting had to be read in the discipline, and Ezequiel Lavezz's goal, which came from the bench, was rejected at the very end.
Malmö’s bullet Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was his own class. “We played the previous Championship League game in December last year.
After that, we have only played in the Swedish league where the level is not the same.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A sense of the Parisians.
This was a great match for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in equity
In the mid-week stock exchange, the Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was tested by commodity prices, raised USD 2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he had sold new shares at about GBP 1.6 billion in order to reduce the debt.
The company’s market value fell by 57 per cent this year. The company is struggling with a drop in the price of raw materials when the Chinese economic downturn hampers demand and burdens the market.
With the share, Glencore's share price hurt the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday as the beginning of the morning.
The share rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pounds in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69% increase.
Glencore announced last week its intention to raise $2.5 billion in equity as part of a strategy to reduce its debt to $30 billion by a third.

White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Communication published on Tuesday by the White House confirms that China’s President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives on the first official visit to Washington, D.C., on 25 September, and is a guest visit to Beijing by President Barack Obama last November.
Following bilateral discussions between the Heads of State and the President's spouse Michelle Obama, Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liuan will hold dinners to honour the state visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to discuss constructive issues of disagreement", the White House Communication states.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and is expected to be held in Seattle to meet a number of US technology leaders, from Seattle to Washington and from there to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-vaccination and the increased activities of the country in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon diminishes diversity in filming
Matt Damon fiercely discussed with Effie Brown, an African American, and said that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight section of Sunday night, Brown was interrupted by an actor who explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the script selected for the project's dark main character.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the programme," Damon said.
Brown stumbled on a stunned and injured claim. "Wow, that's it," she said after a comment by Damon, who stared at the one-movement Mars film.
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at the beginning.
"Only a dark figure is a prostitute who has sex with her white mate."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as the directors of the film. Damon replied harshly that the double choice could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was on television, the social media exploded on Damon’s horrendous comments.
Twitter user Mr.Pooni expressed his anger at the scene directly: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark person to explain what diversity is, is so white-hearted that it hurts."
Television was divided more than 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments are at a time when equal representation in the media of human races is at the top of the agenda.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, died from a White Police bullet in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement received support throughout the country. The movement seeks to stop discriminatory treatment of the dark ones of lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the issue when presenting the year's album candidates in the Grammygaala.
"Album still matters," he said.
"Like, like books and the lives of dark people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published an opinion in response to Fow News' question by Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group in question should be characterised as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love", the management of the movement said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if Damon has responded to the invitation.
In the American ninja warrior series, the first winner
Professionalist and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed off on his winnings for a million dollars.
During the seventh period of the TV series, for the first time, all the tasks assigned were examined.
In the last period of the season, Caldiero and the photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last assignment, men had to pain from 23 meters of rope up to 30 seconds.
He was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American ninja warrior competition, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster and became a winner.
After a hard fight, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after picking up a million-dollar pot.
"The winning sum is incredible, because I have never earned more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his winning spot.
"All right, I can't even imagine what this is all about, the future is completely open."
The responsible producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to finish all the tasks.
"The rules state that the fastest way to win the prize money is to win.
If more competitors resolve all the tasks, the fastest win", Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is great and transforms life, but also Britten gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he's gonna be able to bury it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's had a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy. He's an important family guy.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he played victory preferably to Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth period, the descriptions of which begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers won the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers don't have any particularly comfortable experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the top leagues in baseball, is now in the final place of the American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting Minnesota Twins Target Field.
Twins lost his chance to get up in Houston Astros to seem to be fighting for another wild card spot on the drop-off games.
The Detroit returned, even for one night, with a taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every win is nice, no matter how it is achieved," said Brad Ausmus of Tigers.
Tigers’ pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his surface when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two laps, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth laps.
Simon (13-9) entered 6 1/3 laps of good play and released three runs.
He's only got three good starts on nine outings.
"I just want to decide the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for the player to throw in every game, and that's why I want to feed up to the sixth turn."
Tigers' pitchers Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs that were his first run after mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hits on July 6 after he received four hits against Seattle Mariners.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"She looks good in the playoffs and kept her in a cool game."
The second round of the seventh pair, Twins, had the best chance to get back to the game.
Central copper Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting two nests with a close to the left border.
Right copper Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice blow, and Simon took the turn of second Brian Dozier, who took three straight feeds before becoming his left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a freeway to the Wall, and the incoming feeder's location was hit by Miguel Telle, who hit the two nests, and then got a right-handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners on the field, VerHagen got a three-time Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League led the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had hit the 9th lap on the first lap, Tigers finalist Bruce Rondon hit two laps, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed feeder threw three direct feeds and was able to hold his team position.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes being a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs on the first two laps against the right-handed hangar who had just got back on the injured list. The man was on the side of the month due to the back infection.
"Of course, it wasn't the kind of thing I'd hoped for. However, the game started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform well and a few good feeds in the third turn," Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave one nest to the second Ian Kinsler in the first round.
Right copper J.D. Martinez's freeway brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
The Victor Martinez 0/21 pipe broke when the team had players at the wash.
The third Nick Castellanos was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned while trying to get to the third.
The Tigers added their lead in the second round. Capt. James McCann survived the second and Anthony Gose hit the first, where the situation was between 3 and 0.
"Mell hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the punch hit a suitable spot."
The shift was Hughes, who entered a pointless third pair, after which he was replaced by A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance came in three runs, six hits, a freeway and four straight feeds.
Note: Tigers right-handed fighter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the composition because of the revitalization of the shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list because of the resurgence of the shoulder until mid-August, and he was supposed to join on Wednesday.
When Sanchez does not play, the left-handed fighter Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and participates in the initial composition against Twins.
Norris has won 1-1 in four games after he was replaced by David Pricee on 30 July.
He has been absent from composition since August 20th due to the vortex of the abdominal muscle.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series on Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) receives Ervin Santanan (5-4, running average: 4.73).
Xi urges us to open up the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world for growth," said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday at the Economic Reform Steering Group meeting on Tuesday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to developing a policy of economic opening", the President stated at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group established to deepen the comprehensive reform.
"Promoting the policy of opening up and deepening reforms is driving new momentum and vitality for economic growth," Xi said.
The management group adopted guidelines, which included a negative list of market access rules, a reduction in border control policies, the promotion of private capital participation in state-owned enterprises and the revision of the citizens' registration system.
According to the Communication, a negative list is to be drawn up of sectors and companies to which investment is prohibited.
The system is gradually tested and developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a significant change as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, a legal business environment and opening up the market.
The government is also reducing corporate supervision and I would like to ensure that companies have a decision-making power over their own business.
According to the Communication, China will allow for the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border regions and the search for new mechanisms for regional growth.
As a result of the opening of State-controlled sectors, many sectors are opening up to private investment.
"The Board does not change its policy on foreign investment; it supports the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and provides them with better services", the Communication states.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit is optimised by improving requirements and streamlining the search process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to practise their profession and to support judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
