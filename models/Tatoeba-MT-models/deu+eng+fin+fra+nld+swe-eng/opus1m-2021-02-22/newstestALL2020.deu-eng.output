Fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, North of France, which is considered particularly dangerous, was removed, and on Friday the prefecture of Normandy reported. The fire broke out on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
The company is part of the company Lubrizole of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. The company is part of the company Lubrizole from US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive.
Around 400 people are working at the plant. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when gas methane was released by a leak in 2013 and the environment roamed far after low eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Woman quits her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been cut off from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every track - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King said to the Daily Inter Lake. "She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then, when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked the dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception desk. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately called out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, weeks passed. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who announced their job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: a man registered and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just wanted to hug her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" dimension.
With the German Federal Defence, weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing - many of them so far untracked. Since the beginning of 2014, the army has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is reflected in a list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the German editorial network reports about.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part and 3474 ammunition have been reappeared. The weapons and parts of weapons that have remained missing are, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 weapon tubes for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "frightening," said Martina Renner, the Left Party Member of Parliament. This is all the more so because, in the course of investigations, it had hardly been found again. The Left Party politician spoke of a "bad balance". Renner criticised that the list was not recognisable whether under the missing ammunition there was also the one found in connection with the investigations against the Federal Defence Officer Franco A. "And this although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official message from Tehran.
The "Sena Impero" was accused on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Sea Road of Hormuz of violating security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran would respond to the controversial temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, a member of the United Kingdom.
The Hormuz road is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped through the seabed. The tensions in the region have increased considerably in recent months. The commercial shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel honors the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went to the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had turned the then GDR regime upside down, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken from the horrors," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tessla's quarter may be holding records. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given its electric car group a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. For this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered good 95000 cars and thus reached its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Riddles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from ticking themselves. This was discovered by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments in rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children fight so violently against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand already triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
According to the evidence, earlier research has shown that rats with "laughter" react in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the big brain cortex, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and contact with others - that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments in the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area concerned of the big brain are suppressed during self-touching. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign touch and tickling by scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been increased.
But pass the self-touching and touching by others at the same time, be the laugh also suppressed. This indicates that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between the self-touching and the touching by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment, they broke off this initiation sometimes prematurely, showed flight behaviour or horror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kite is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster reversed: Big fire deleted in French chemical works
The big fire in a chemical plant that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This was reported on Friday by the prefecture of the Normandie of the news agency AFP. The fire broke out during the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have been removed, and the samples taken give no reason to be alarmed, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizole of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when gas methane was released by a leak in 2013 and the environment roamed far after low eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to take the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement, should Brussels not respond to his requests for amendments to the Brexit agreement, but how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had stood up for Britain's stay in the European Union, "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and re-establish this country would be to withdraw the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum election campaign in 2016.
Commemoration of Oslo and Utöya attacks
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial is unveiled on Saturday in Norway in honour of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 replicas of iron roses. It is reminiscent of the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. At the opening are expected among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first shot a car bomb in the Oslo government quarter and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp on Utöya Island from the Social Democratic Workers’ Party’s Youth Organisation. Overall 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to get back to sea in Iran. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Sena Impero" has been held in the streets of Hormus in Iran since mid-July. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the Stena Bulk shipping company.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now, among other things, going to Dubai for medical examinations," declared Reedereichef Erik Hånell. Towards noon the ship left Iranian waters. "It's nice to have it over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July under the pretext of violating the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well in the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have behaved professionally in view of the difficult and exciting situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company was now working to bring them back together as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar after the establishment of the "Stena Impero": at the beginning of July, a super-tanker with oil from Iran intended for Syria had been put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was in violation of EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The notice of the ship had been received by the British from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects that it had been a deal to free the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
Hormus Road is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seabed. The tensions in the region have increased considerably over the past few months. The commercial shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
The nuclear dispute between both countries is behind the tension between Tehran and Washington. The Americans are accusing the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018 alone, the United States had withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement, which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on the Tehran leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent agreement extended to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Sena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
The Iranian President, Hassan Ruhani, had presented a plan for security and peace on the Hormus road at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign powers of protection, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the initiative of the Coalition of Hope.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be the "winner of war". In view of the penalties imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to re-dispose. Asian finance managers who are considering moving their production from China to another country, call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This, of course, has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role in the global wide-band production chain.
But now India itself has been placed in Trump's focus. By the beginning of June, America has removed the trade preferences for 2000 products from the hooding in the White House devalued as "kingdom of tariffs". The US prohibitively impose high tariffs on India and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, just a side show. In addition, America is also looking at the world’s largest democracy through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are combining concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, an American penalty tariff against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to be safe.
The problem, however, lies in another place: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has been difficult in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reformer is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness, which stifled for too long in the multi-population state any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies are now receiving faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more robust insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for seeming to liquidate companies with high debt more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, in India much has turned to better in the first five modes years. However, in trade policy this does not apply. Hence, the national conservative government even created new barriers to protecting internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi hangs up the nymbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well what vocabulary western managers like. At the heart, however, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus to become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive due to the separation of their industries belong to the leaders of the Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about this short-sighted policy.
Rehab of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, reported the news agency AFP calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in close family circles. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the Invalidity of Paris, as reported by the media.
Targeted to the competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletics World Cup
The world peak had long since been in the finish when the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium was playing hot scenes. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to vary dangerously. He could barely hold himself on his feet about 300 meters in front of the finish, ran in an unsightly position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly brought him down and dragged him to the finish supporting the last half of the stadium round. The forces, however, were still sufficient to stop the watch running after the finish. As if the scene hadn’t been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unanticipatedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He was shy, he didn’t want to talk about his heroate at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Federation for the World Cup. In normal circumstances he shouldn’t have even started. "That’s why I’m proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this in the evening with a great deal of pressure - and much more intense than he would have thought, because this hero's act will be remembered. Especially Dabo even left his competitors Busby in the finish and voluntarily took the final place - by the way, just five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. At the end of the day, it had nothing to do with it, because the busby, which came to the finish with much help, was disqualified by the World Athletes Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had come to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, although he was 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I had been under 18 minutes before." However, only during the training, there were best times not included.
Million mesh: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. On Friday, a reinforced police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo. Several metro stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In recent days the police had strengthened their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had partly searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds of people had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there were hundreds of participants in protests against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor living in exile in Spain and actor Mohammed Ali, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" today in central places in the country. Ali calls for a "popular revolution". The man is also not "good" for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractor for the army for millions, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "involuntarily arrested" "only because they were 'in the wrong place for the wrong time'," HRW told more prisoners by calling on lawyers. According to their lawyers, the accusations against prisoners range from "dispersal of false information" to membership in a "terrorist union". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces interviewed and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW data, also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Shipping Dealers should be able to donate returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the turnover tax on material donations, the Ministry explained a question of the Greens-Bundestagsfraktion, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. The dealers could, however, set the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little turnover tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany would send back every sixth package on the Internet. Approximately four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - were then dumped. According to the current legal situation, they would spend additional money on the companies, because the financial authorities value donations like a turnover, which is then subject to turnover tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products and can donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being penalised for donation. This applied not only to online trade, but also to other shops from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will be auctioned in the near future.
For Branczik, Banksy's work "reforms the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the fundamentals of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital, until it will be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Question hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
On Wednesday, at the first meeting of the House of Commons following the abolition of a suspension by the Supreme Court of Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had provided a hard exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the twice postponed Brexit on 31 October, if necessary, without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the South East of England, he painted a picture representing a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy that. We will (out of the EU) stand out and we will win".
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and accused them of, among other things, "fraud" on the people. Indictments that he could put MEPs in danger because they could become targets of murder threats, he did as "humane".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest was if MEPs were finally to respect the British' decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were raised to say that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect with one another," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, called on the United Nations to intervene again in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General's debate in New York. "If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which were divided into the Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers control one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had removed the Indian Kashmir region's autonomy status and thus dramatically increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It is shooting with sharp ammunition at the population, more than 2000 prisoners are joined in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting was never dangerous in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took over power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing all it can to avoid a scenario like in the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by its own government drove millions to the streets. And that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not even get in control of, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case in front of el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty in getting a bottle of water at all.
Tüv-tests in terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" anymore for capital airport
Two months have been checked to see whether the complex system is working in conjunction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After extensive Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chief Supervisory Officer Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control committee.
The airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed exam, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured us that the schedule until the start-up was still buffered.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve is not expected to be too large. The ready-to-building display is now to be submitted to the Construction Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables still need to be fixed; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, it is necessary to continue to work closely on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of proof, less of new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects that this is available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the crossing to the station below the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had led the project to a further crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that go down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros since the start of construction in 2006.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the responsible authorities are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is scheduled to take place on 18 October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial manager Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on her feet.
Chemnitz: Automatics for drugs blown up - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he was chasing up a number of ATMs in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of blasted cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply. A million damage has occurred!
The police took a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations into the production of explosives explosions in the unit with a particularly serious case of theft carried out by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-olds was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his drug addiction with the prey." Only four times the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least 60 000 euros!
The automatic bombardment is now under investigation, and police investigations against him are continuing.
It is also possible that he was responsible for further automatic spraying in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's subsidiary AUA will take over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this matter.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billiglieger Eurowings will therefore be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020 onwards, the AUA will take over the "Wettle", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter engines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The speaker explained that the Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning. The aim is to coordinate flight times on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, this Eurowings in Vienna would only be used as a "production company" for the group's sisters AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product was to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants were to come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer made in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki battle, a prize battle broke out at Vienna Airport. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna next summer would be raised to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost aircraft will be sending four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wettle", which the union criticised as a bypass construction for the collective agreement.
On Friday, the Head of the Air Force Michael O'Leary, who said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said: "We will remain the number one location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelein Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays early this month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped at the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely happy to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, who, according to British media reports since October 2018, has been joining us in the official announcement.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years this will be very helpful, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos recorded her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the marriage of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the genetics of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail about the analysis of the genetics of 9000 people.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) notified on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking, and unhealthy diets are among the essential factors affecting the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was said. Now, the scientists want to compare the full inheritance of 8,000 healthy people with that of the 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes are known to have possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - called the clinic. Each year about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. Data could also be useful in the investigation of other popular diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Center for Cardiac and Cardiovascular Disorders. New insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos is dealing with allergies in particular. At the medical campus there, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operating at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". According to the clinic, with 45,000 volunteers, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the case of genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists insured it with a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, a person’s genetic heritage can be decrypted within 24 hours, which amounts to 1300 euros. The first global gene sequencing, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. In the following year, first results are expected.
Nigerian Police Freed Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to reports from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told them. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an. In fact, the protectors had been held by their teachers under "the most disdainful and inhuman conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Koran school was reported to have been around for ten years. Residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They would not have heard of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often poor state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief agency, over 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria Police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria released almost 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
On Thursday the children had been discovered after a hint in an Islamic school, where the conditions there had been "unworthy". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, together with boys, had been held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV pictures showed paralyzed and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World Football Selection: Further Prejudices to Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football elections, other countries are accused of the FIFA. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, many things at the FIFA have proved to be repugnant: the World Cup awards, the dubiotic plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Football Choice has so far not been suspected of being unclean - if one refrains from the fact that the qualified national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than for objective judgment.
But since Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting summary.
The FIFA apologizes for the fact that "signatures on the election forms had been given in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's Trainer also surprised
There is also a call from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation is comprehensible in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, however, the vote had also been taken in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: “Do not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my vote are wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The news came from the association on Friday: vote, but of course there was no intention. The filled-out election documents were "errorly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a communication from the association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had actually chosen. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error," the communication said. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being examined by the FIFA in an investigation, but it is emphasized that the election process was externally supervised by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the uncontested winner of the World Football Choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine case: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly declared themselves in favour of an official investigation against the US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this is carried out from here, is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower cases before measures are taken. An impeachment process can lead to the removal of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump Biden observed "for years".
The Republicans have so far been critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few of them have been shown to be uncomfortable. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate Governor of Virginia had already opposed Trump’s policy on several occasions, such as the relaxation of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right course of action and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and get it right."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, did not formally participate in the trial against Trump, which is decided by Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolically important. Nevertheless, even the first Senators of Republicans have made critical statements about the situation. With Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." U.S. media also report that among Republicans there were internal first cracks.
The affair could lead to the launch of an official investigation against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, and they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorizedly controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 lybian refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was rescinded after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects were captured in a detention camp in Messina (Sicilia) after migrants had recognized their pests in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any certain information on it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben New builder of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the communication said.
NGOs and relief agencies now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who are the people. They come without passports," said new builders. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that also perpetrators are on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed."
Italy's former Italian Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk aims to record delivery at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given its electric car group a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. For this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Renews only one bridge financing
The new budget year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to finance it in transition until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1, the United States once again have no expenditure plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a Shutdown on Monday at midnight, a part-session of the Federal Administration. President Trump has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown turned down
For the time being, the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 that ends on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the spending framework extended from 1.3 to 1.4 bio. $ for the new fiscal year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have hardly any chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly majority capable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are clearly trying to force $12 billion to build walls, one of President Trump’s major priorities. Democrats are disrupting the plans for and funding for the construction of the walls, which is intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the walls had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shut-down.
The spirits are separated from the wall building
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than agreeing on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21. Also a Shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the Congress’s continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a Shutdown gain ideas for automating the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the previous year’s level, prevent the travel of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual expenditure plans are available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, thus significantly increasing the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many children without father could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which was defended by Agnès Buzyn, Minister of Health as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to its conception, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by the social security system.
Restricted fertilization with sperm from dead husband
On the other hand, the National Assembly rejected by a small majority an amendment designed to allow widows to have access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were cases in which women in vain complained about the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the attack in Paris argued that such a child had a "specially serious fate" in the past.
On the other hand, numerous members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had declared themselves in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if her husband's death still left her child's wish unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment find it unfair that a widow may be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. You must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the mother-in-law would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for flight charges for United States are getting louder
A lot of flying is taking place at the universities, which is why the country will continue to pay a tax on climate change. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschschulete
The discussion of a climate tax on flights from universities and universities delayed before the summer break is back in motion. After the state-rectors’ conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württembergn universities and a pedagogic university advocate compensation for service flights. This was the first step "urgently necessary", at the same time there had to be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, it is stated in their opinion. The Cabinet decision originally planned in July is now still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia captures again North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested persons are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were already arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fishermen later suffered serious injuries. However, this time there were no injured persons, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were thus travelling in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information, the coastguard of Russia drives patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30.000 seized octopus
In the new inspections, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russian fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans even after complaints from local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been temporarily arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head of the Russian association of fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. They would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled.
Only 18,000 will be in the future: the US will lower the asylum ceiling
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is shooting at those seeking protection: As the Foreign Ministry confirms in Washington, the upper limit for the legal migration of refugees will be lowered further. In the future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be granted.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. In the current marketing year, the limit is still 30.000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to take in for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Barack Obama's predecessor government had far higher admission limits.
The perceived ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless referred to the United States as the "most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the President-in-Office of the United States.
"A responsible approach" to refugees aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help them rebuild," said Trump. "For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to block. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj case and a potentially threatening official lifting procedure.
The U.S. government, according to a presentation from the U.S. External Office, intends to focus on the admission of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military in the country and who are thus in danger, as stated in the declaration of the Foreign Ministry, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America are applying for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US South border with Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
A Orang-Utan Weibchen has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a detention centre for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so their release was mandatory. The animal was taken on a direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human monkeys are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are expected to live in the open space of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet from Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to endure another 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animalists has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational centre for the conservation of biodiversity will be created there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in the almost 3000-metre-high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss invaded the 550-metre-high northern wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he undercut the old benchmark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the U.S. sports product manufacturer Nike has made a significant profit increase. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 per cent more than in the previous year’s period, as reported by the Group on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the adidas competitor directly turns to its customers online.
The sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The largest increase in Nike sales was in China, with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the Beaverton Group in Oregon also benefited from its approach to address consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to push forward the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Long-lived stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus was insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasrome You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. pride in being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late on Thursday. He reported the fan’s account at Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters should never again visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scanning Italian fans of racist intimidation against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One has to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist songs at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin last time. The Italian authorities have now made 38 marginal fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence, among other things. The club had put the investigations in motion last year with an announcement.
The ultra-leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade in tickets after Italian media reports. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the Z generation is political - whole years are considered with gripping names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21st, this call officially launched the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also opened the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in ecological terms ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already begun to grow crabs in the early 1990s. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a distinctive sector that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. Over the past few years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crabs and a technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform of the "division of power, optimization of administration and administrative services" and has carefully built up the service network for "authorisations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending", which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun makes full use of the advantages offered on site by the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and makes use of the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost for the settlement of smart high-end production companies, biomedical and medical companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors and organic farming companies operating in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has contributed to the development of a national, all-area tourism zone and of tourist destinations of national importance. It is worth integrating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, the state of the buildings for citizen services and for the public service, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" further developed energetically and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani talks about the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to abolish sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, would have put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani explained on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to withdraw the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions that should be terminated had been discussed. "And they clearly said we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this attempt was not carried out in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the sanctions in force and the "toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is supposed to deter the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope, as Merkel did on the margins of the UN General Assembly, that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay said on Friday. This is the cause for concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. On Thursday the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolises. Now, the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, octay announced.
In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built houses fall in - among other things, must have been made by the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have for years warned that large open areas registered in the centre have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the Istanbul Chamber of Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of the Thursdayquake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority Afad. A smaller after-warning caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told us on Twitter that the injured or damage had not been reported at first. The state station TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the Silivri district. Some students wept as shown on pictures.
Under the Marmara Sea, there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died at that time.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten strength. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, it already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed up so-called Go-Bags with all the necessarys next to doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is rocking. When the next great earthquake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), which reported that two minarets of mosques crashed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks many users report panic. Buildings were rocking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was harder than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is stated at 1.59 p.m. (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey reported that there was an aftershock that was indicated on the judge scale with a strength of 4.0.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 has shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolises, the disaster protection agency Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. This would make it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Before or later, the great earthquake will come too."
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake triggered great concern in Istanbul as well. In Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had been raging.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine business
Two broken documents provide new ignition in Ukraine's affairs for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official investigation procedure, the US Democrats see strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous informant about Trump and its controversial phone call to the Ukrainian President contains important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". In addition, he doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Air passenger locked in toilet by United Airlines - Rerouted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines has been redirected. The WC door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported according to U.S. media.
In an off-plan landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the tight cabin. About an hour had she been locked in, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to U.S. media is supposed to come from flight 1554, one can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're working right now to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?", says a man in it. The airline apologized to all the passengers.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is distinctive.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "Die Verwandlung" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, was announced by the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It deals with the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let nothing stop and nobody stop.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like once the Soviet leaders, if Brexit in high places just lend the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." By McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915's first published story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into a huge ungrateful", is gradually being excluded from family and society and finally goes down. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands in the head," said the Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests EUR 9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are equipped with air brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be made "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
This included bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had gone into the trap of the British parent company and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers now want to return money to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday hotel abroad, which currently houses Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance company. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are conditional upon the fact that holidaymakers are no longer invited to extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as one Zurich speaker from the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are not invited from now on to the individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," said Spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports by hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their accommodation on site. Some had to put more than EUR 1000 on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers were still travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are currently on the go. For Thomas-Cook customers who only want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies for such bookings that have already been paid.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said. As a general rule, insurance is also responsible for these cases in Zurich. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out on the Kaera website about how to refund the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys Sperm Mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now directly following his mother's footsteps.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed with a blue flint guard vest, set a blast mine on fire and destroyed.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the village of Dirico on Friday morning, he set up the ignition circuit. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape, without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly on the trail of his mother Diana in Huambo City (1961-1997). With the same warlord, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back to the path she went at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day Africa trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Indeed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he will not be able to make a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made by the polarizing British for a long time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is like a Damocles burden over the blonde. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out his Brexit course firmly until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had consistently ruled out this category again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal's still possible
But the pressure does not seem to go beyond Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made suggestions that, in case of non-conclusion, he will support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I’m cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is beginning to run away from Brexit negotiators in Brussels. For about six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators have had time to prevent Britain’s exit from the European Union without agreement. However, even the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at present. Does not break the law, a further shift in the date of withdrawal is in force. The opposition, however, does not comply with the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to 12. Furthermore, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injured persons in this regard, the U.S. Health Authority reported to CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than 900 people were already confirmed, some 500 of them were confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe so far. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
The Fear of New Protests in Egypt Grows
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks millions of times, and the construction contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution". Today's Friday he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics accuse corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to see mass demonstrations with a million participants in central parts of the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already a reinforced police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days the police had strengthened their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had been partly searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been protests with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization, there had been nearly 2,000 arrests since last week. Many of them had been arrested arbitrarily - only because they were "in the wrong place for the wrong time", HRW reported arresters calling on lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been governing the country since 2013, after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed on his arrival in Hamburg Harbour by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg to the Atlantic with the race "Malizia".
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What is happening on the sea often takes place without the public," Fuchs said. "He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenland's glacier was measured and fished for microplastics with nets.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists payed for noodles 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. Although the bill with 80 Euro tip was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, causing hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We ask the police to look at the question of whether this is a fraud," asked a spokesman of Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero.
Promptly came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese would not only have ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official investigation procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks, until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal, allegedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation about national security and the democracy of the United States to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: the President had misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for influence on the 2020 election. He had used Ukraine’s dependence to blackmail and thus forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be found in the now published cover of the discussion with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which next to Trump stands his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times reports about Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are weak. "We don't mix ourselves into a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says to the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal." Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasy fixed on Trump's counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version Giulianis and the President says: The former Vice-President and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, urged the release of the then Ukrainian Attorney General, Viktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company that he was responsible for, in whose Supervisory Board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior has pressed Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt actions of his family.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was by far not the only Western partner who pushed for his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allerarängen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3:30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems affected by the disturbance, although not so far to the same extent.
Instagram and co. frequently affected by disorders
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also, this time, rely mainly on Twitter to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of the Antarctic. They were on the way with a hose boat and several miles away from its base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were above the tubing boat".
Poland has operated Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE charging wireless
Practical but harmful
Inductive technique via qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first and foremost the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is highly practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If a mobile phone is normally charged by cable, the battery is heated to 27 degrees within three hours. At the wireless charging, the researchers have measured the perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging ladder always above 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging ladder increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and life span
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but does not last for so long in general. Thus, the life span is reduced. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since battery replacement is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of battery replacement - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging ladder - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and heavy plug fummel. Because Qi (for inductive energy transfer) is a world standard, in which, exceptionally, Apple is involved, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 eight thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber, according to his own data, climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, told his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Potential". He has already made international headlines: from him comes a photograph of climbers who have been viral in spring, standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of mass anxiety triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died during the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th eight thousander: At present, the Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to speak with China in order to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman reported on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former Sigiriya rock fortress. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. The death penalty is theoretically imposed.
Arrested British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was established by Iran. This was announced by the Maritime Transport Agency Bandar Abbas according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the British flag-driven tanker on 19 July under the pretext of violating the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in critique
The House of Commons' responsible economic committee wants to investigate the crime of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail. It is about the salary packages of the board as well as the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the company that is fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the company's supervision as well as the control by external accountants," said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to deal with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overrated by the risk of intestinal cancer
To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are probably more difficult than they have been so far. This has implications for the calculations of individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk makes Tesla share increase
Musk wrote this to Tesla staff in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, it was further mentioned in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. For this to happen, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of the market with a more than six percent increase. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Do British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson restrained
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers that he is looking for ways of circumventing the last law adopted by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a question like this, he merely said to journalists on Friday that his government will respect the law applicable.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capitulation Act", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would delay the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to have an agreement."
Iran apparently drives uranium enrichment high
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions,” said Rohani at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they do not stand up to their promises, he set out “more steps” away from the agreements of the difficult negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a commitment to Tehran, to normalize economic relations. In 2018 alone, the United States emerged from the agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now re-establishing tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded with a revival of uranium enrichment limited by the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared to use the centrifuge installed in early September with uranium. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and the burden of pressing US sanctions, said Rohani, but there will still be further talks that will hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the quantity situation changed: on Monday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had confessed to the attack, but this was regarded by the US as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"These who raise such accusations must provide evidence for this," said Rohani. "However, the European leaders would not have been able to do this during the UN general debate with him. Instead, they would only have called on the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, requested Rohani. He called on the Washington government to turn to a policy of dialogue and reason.
Comet of other stars crossed through solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This has been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially a mere assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptised after its explorer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most widespread comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object that was seen during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Travel Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way to a so-called hyperbelway that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was first conducted under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, received the designation 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen on the approach. Thus, researchers will stay for months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "By October 2020 it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into view. Thus, a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, identified the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Pictures of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first spectrum of interstellar sulphur stars that offer a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could shape themselves through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often such tipping visitors are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly start a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (for example, comet trappers) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to lurk either on an still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, it is time: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger engine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers are expected to be made each year at the new airport, and by 2025, 72 million are expected. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “sesters” due to its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways, which are later to be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers to Beijing city centre in just 20 minutes.
Even during the construction period, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New oversonic aircraft is due to fly in 2030: Four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British Space Agency (UK Space Agency) is dreaming of making this oversounded flight a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the Oxfordshire Reaction Engines company, US-Sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said Agency Manager Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to drive the project forward, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australians. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. So far, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the end of its operation in 2003, and it took three to three and a half hours. In 2000 there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, where all 109 passengers died. Last year, the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a "X-Plane" with the US Space Agency, the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable frame vehicles".
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine business
In the Ukraine affair about the US President's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before U.S. employees at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such a person in the past "a little different" than today.
This was regarded as an intimidating attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. On Friday, however, several U.S. media distributed audio recordings of the speech. Democrats responded indignantly to the President’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official investigation against Trump. Their accusations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence staff member, who made serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. The reports of the complainant had been made public on Thursday, on high public pressure.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country intervenes in the U.S. election in 2020 in his favour.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate possible harm to his political rival Joe Biden. This is about the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his protestant from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is at the forefront of the race for the democratic presidential candidature for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of defamation with regard to the Ukraine telephone: Senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. However, this was removed from a database, usually provided for by the White House, after the conversation, and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The reporter's identity is not publicly known, and the "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's intelligence service abroad.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread information from second hand that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, however, annoyed. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded troubledly and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
Several investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been carried out in various committees in the House of Representatives for months. In view of Ukraine’s accusations, the Democrats are now moving forward with new momentum in order to initiate a possible official investigation against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, head of the secret service committee in the House of Representatives. Trump attacked the ship sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and called for the committee chairman's resignation again. Trump reviled the ship regularly and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, who were mostly working under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, were behind the possible arrest procedures initiated by the Democrats in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations were true, Trump's "unscrupulous abuse of power" would be called.
There is no precise timetable for the further trial. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment process a work. However, the decision on an actual lifting of the office was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a process are low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
VW Board of Directors: Job cuts "sluggish"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer’s works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023. 500 million of these will be saved this year.
The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016, already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. As a general rule, a job can only be dismantled by the car builder if it is proven that the related activities are no longer required. Furthermore, an employment guarantee will apply by 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually at disposition, are "sliding" down a different path - that is, past the official course. Thus, free regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no means of forcing the re-employment. Meanwhile, staff in many places fail to take up labour compaction, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicles would be greater. Thus, the fear that the production of vehicles could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW, it was only said that "adaptation of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and centralize new projects. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "We are well advised to make ourselves a crisis-proofer, especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the threat of trade war between the US and China."
For example, this year the cost of production per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for Golf 8, which is expected to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for production time do not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is about 7 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants are manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW in-house is subject to the rule that 800,000 cars have to be built each year to ensure that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. However, in 2018 the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems of switching to the new WLTP fuel and exhaust gas testing process.
As Production Manager Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are supposed to roll "perspectively" from the band in Wolfsburg. This is supposed to make it possible to combine the golf production in the main production plant - because the Zwickau plant, by means of the conversion to the location for the E-Auto production, makes the golf production possible.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on Golf 8. He is supposed to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg in spite of all efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: human traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers must be imprisoned for this.
On Friday, six alleged Nigerian human traffickers were sentenced in Bochum to trial and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The accused had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the Nigerians had yet to make a ritual vow in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locks in hose boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to deal with the alleged closing costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on the brothel in the trial. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some of them were properly opposed".
The judgments refer to the admission of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, detention and heavy prostitution in terms of employment and labour.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo flight crew with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the labour struggle measures in the LH group", told Ufo chief executive Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. The issue is also whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to appeal against it. "The fact that a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo Executive Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed an application with the Frankfurt Labour Court to have the status of Ufo as a trade union reviewed by court. The company argued that the trade union had not established a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a trade union partner.
In the past, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which many members of the board as well as the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended an initial vote on the cabin staff strikes at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it should change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to reach for tourists. Visas are usually only given for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ore-conservative kingdom hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. Riad, on his own account, wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in the East of Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oilfield. In the following, national oil production broke dramatically, oil price shocks increased. It is likely to take several weeks until the Kingdom’s oil production reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor's farewell in Los Angeles according to the People's Magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, inter alia banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the Promi couple wants to marry ecclesiastically next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the yes word in a New York office. There was no major festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two dead in a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the fall of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metshin), the police reported. The dead included a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and urban growth are the causes of the threat, reported the IUCN World Conservation Union on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are at risk. 66 were already at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangerous", "strongly endangered", "from extinction threatened" and "disappeared" to "died out" in nature. Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Threatened Eberese and Wild Ross Kastanie
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) in particular were threatened, one of the authors said, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It has been considered "dangerous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is the Balkan mining moth next to a mushroom. Since the 1980s it has spread from south-eastern Europe to the whole continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horses in Europe (Aesculus hippocantanum) to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and isolated areas.
Straw species and moss also in danger
At the same time the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than a fifth of the molluscs and moss and almost half of all shrub species are at risk, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weeds like snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that make up the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The latest earthquake in Turkey has injured 34 people. According to the information, there were no deaths. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake on the previous day, almost 200 aftershocks have occurred. The 5,8th earthquake had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolises.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, octay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük, south-east of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a surge of strength had shaken the region around Istanbul 4.6. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl, which the singers announced on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" are standing together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most widely seen TV broadcasts in the USA. Even though you have recently dropped viewer numbers: This February, the spectacle attracted the least spectators in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still an average of almost a hundred million people.
The semi-time show of the past Super Bowl had been in the forefront of riots: In the dispute over the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 introduced the half-time show - the critics were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, at that time quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knees during the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem for protest against police force and racism. Kaepernick started a movement with his protest, many players took the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unconcerned since March 2017 and has no longer contested the NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to pay dearly to the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans are threatening. Credit Suisse, too, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make total write-offs of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report. This would have shown estimates from the consulting company AlixPartners.
The borrowers of bonds would have to purchase amortizations of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual write-off amounts should be more likely to be at the top of the band widths, one expert told the sheet.
How great the losses of creditors will be in the end will be after the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not extort too much hope. For example, the around 40 planes from Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. Most of the money could probably be obtained with the sale of airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it was continued.
Rackete is said to have taken suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have taken men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the speaker of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the Italian Messina detention camp. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
On June 29, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa and carried a ship from the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects were also said to have arrived there. Against the captain, investigations are ongoing on aid for illegal immigration.
USA warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," Pai told the "trade sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges every company "under Chinese jurisprudence" to follow instructions from the security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests", says the FCC Chief Executive. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a "reliability statement".
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "handelsblatt" calling for its own information.
Pai doubted that this would be possible. The 5G technology is not only out of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check each update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
To the Chinese company Huawei, he proposes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent from the government," Pai said to the "trade sheet".
The U.S. is aware that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the U.S. position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A huge fire wall illuminates the sky above a north-French chemical factory. The fire is removed after hours - but the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and kindergartens remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened in advance on Friday, the relevant prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to smoke. There were no injured people. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as reported by the prefecture. There is still a risk that after the deletion smell spread, the prefecture said on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A huge black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which restores the additive for oils. The production facility is a few kilometers away from the city center.
The plant in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are under special supervision. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been found at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams against pollution had been built up, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at around 02.40 in the early morning, reported the authorities. The cause initially remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year on Thursday evening.
The economy in the euro area is weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Those countries that had room for manoeuvre for more investment would have to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these room for manoeuvre, the Minister added, and pointed to the high level of government debt in his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "slowed", Le Maire said.
In recent years, from France, there have been repeated calls for Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
This is how the French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics from
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexite. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician deviates.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is looking to see whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament, which is exactly what is supposed to prevent it. Johnson simply said to journalists that his government will respect the law in force.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capitulation Act", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would delay the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to have an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he felt the political disputes about Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU exit would still be achieved: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will (namely Red: from the EU) will resign, not worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the lead strategist in the British government headquarters Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromised policy that led the Prime Minister into a rather elusive situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all standing in front of Linda McCartney's camera, who has become one of the great rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" is deeply reflected in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda in 1998 from 1969 to her death, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the volume "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid September. Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front wife Chrissie Hynde were among the illustrious guests.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fugitive look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found her way to photography, was always on the camera. Thousands of Polaroids made her, a few hundred of them are now released for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one of the main points is always one: her husband Paul - as one may have never seen him before.
As he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, telephoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or carried unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. Mary McCartney said, according to the BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had built from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about choosing the click: You have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney.

"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems with Iran's oil imports, as some companies had "retired because of the US threat".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear programme and does not stick to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to limit reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at present.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens, and that the US immigration system was currently overburdened.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military in the country and were thus in danger, as stated in the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The 1980 programme, which was launched, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and re-established in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current limit of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was just under 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee. “The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the United States, both legally and illegally, and according to his own data, the U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a lace"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying. Anyone who has "been close to a tip" to the informant who has accused him of abuse of power, says Trump according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports in agreement with several U.S. media.
As a result, Trump spoke to U.N. mission employees. When asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a tip." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with this a little differently than we do now."
Observers assessed the latter's comment on a possible appeal to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional inquiry into a possible procedure for the lifting of offices against him, the chairmen of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Service and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower urges the President in a now published complaint to have abused his office in order to ask for an intervention from another country in the U.S. election 2020. Specificallyly, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump encouraged him to investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower itself and its informants are. As reported by the New York Times, however, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's secret service abroad.
Refugee boat kentert: Baby and grandchildren drown in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The boats are often too small. At the time of the sinking of a boat, seven migrants have died - including five children.
Seven migrants died in front of the Greek island of Chios at the time of the sinking. Among the dead victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus rescued from the flood by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also to be a locksmith, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
There are currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in small boats. According to the United Nations Refugee Service (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year.
The Who break off the concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has found a sudden end because of the impassity of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it still runs".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey was "not able to speak now." Townsend promised the audience that he would come to his expense at a restitution concert. However, a date is not yet set.
On Friday in Dallas and on Sunday in Denver, The Who said they would be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly set rental: WeWork lets real estate markets shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had set off a few days ago founder Adam Neumann as head of the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial flexibility for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British “Financial Times”, WeWork, among other things, has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork leases large office space in the long term and leases it in small units to members in the short term. This can be individual self-employed, small startups or entire departments large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at stunning speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, at a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are expected to have increased by increasing the size of new areas to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management of the company is now supposed to pull the emergency brake and stop the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could not only be a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented some 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhatten, one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets, in the last 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts made it possible to increase demand for offices in New York by more than the new ones on the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office space in the US metropolis would have risen at that time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, it looks like in London, where WeWork is now operating several dozen offices in the best location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could move noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased last year by Sparkassen Fund provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. WeWork does not have access to the reserves of WeWork despite long-term leases. In general, the rental of the individual sites of WeWork takes place by extra subsidiaries, known as Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within close limits.
Russia again caught numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again attacked North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 savages had been arrested, who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian National Intelligence Service (FSB) of the Interfax agency, on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time there were no injured persons, it was called. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguards are carrying out patrols to protect their marine biological resources. In the case of the new inspections, 30,000 octopus were discovered. In addition, the data was confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Agency Ria Novosti, the coastguard in 2018 recorded more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans even after claims from local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Russian fishing association in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. They would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be dismantled. The ships themselves do not comply with the sanitary and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, an equally wounded North Korean died of his injuries. On that 17 September Russian border guards first captured a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
USA bans entry against former President Castro
The US has imposed a ban on the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement issued on Thursday with Castro's involvement in " gross human rights violations", has introduced a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As the leader of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had ruled out entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him into his knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of seconded doctors. According to the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go on the road again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is expected to be due to the shift in time in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests over Europe go to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide support on this Friday after the record participation of last week will be, is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people fought for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, during the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of the world’s protesters – around 1.4 million – had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time, a list of demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller municipalities and cities such as Juchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians in her country to make a stronger effort to protect the climate. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more political ambition in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
It was almost a month ago that Thunberg arrived in New York after a two-week transatlantic tower with a high seas race, where she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the United Nations in which she was deeply aware of the heads of state and government of the earth. On Wednesday, in her home town of Stockholm, she was given the alternative Nobel Prize for climate protection by the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow according to the Tass agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette is to cause a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, candles burning as well fall under the ban. Also grilling meatspies on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Fighting Cyber Criminals - Investigators Lift Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time declared a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites on the Moselle as an operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through which internationally operating criminals operate their activities.
This was reported by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been among other things the operators of the world’s second largest Darknet market for drugs, “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had broken down in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016, according to the Attorney General’s Office, was controlled via a server in the cyber bunker.
This kind of host had been selected for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and abroad. It had been the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators wanted to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go on the streets again for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Juchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale campaign in Montreal, Canada.
Climate Protests Who are Thunberg's backmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So all the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl holds the power people of this time in front of her nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is moving the masses to raise young people for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has been able to gain a wealth of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt privileged to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was able to win a crowd of young people for himself and to persuade them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised country, just like Greta Thunberg recently made his trip to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a shadow side? Why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little discouraged about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too big to follow. This is also not unfounded, because the action in the media was very good worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits now separate: Is it morally right to financially enrich themselves in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is becoming more and more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question apparently pious projects by certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have confirmed themselves: a foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and other follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of its kind seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get a close look at an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelbahn that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Authority Nasa. "By October 2020 it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial findings on Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tailing star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems through similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, de León.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. It may be possible that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again, asteroids deal with the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid broke by the earth and approached her dangerously.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
It becomes more lonely around Boris Johnson. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister squeezs with clear words the war language of the Premier as "flavorless". It is not the brother they know.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip himself - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House on this Wednesday, this was a massive outrage of the opposition, and meanwhile other critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sender Sky News that her brother's use of words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit were "hanged, dragged, four-parted, tarnished and feathered." She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again," said Rachel Johnsons, who had entered the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexite party "Change UK".
In particular, her brother, Jo Cox, mentioned an EU-friendly Underhouse Deputy, who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 departure referendum. His memory could best be honored by passing the Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the Underhouse. "It is very tasteless to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," said Johnson's sister. The perpetrator obviously came from the far right camp that felt 'through this kind of language' reinforced. For all those who mourned about them, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used like that," he tweeted. The best way to honor her was if you enter passionately and determinedly for what you believe - no matter what view you are. But never should you "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen that had become more likely in the attacks.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory member. "I had been broken between family loyalty and national interest in the past months - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson’s language was also strongly criticized in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country." In a joint statement they stated: "In the past few days, language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women appear with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show at the upcoming US Football League finals, announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage - and two Latins," Lopez said. "This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. In 2001 she made her breakthrough worldwide with her first bilingual album and single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected to be in the USA every time. This year, many people also consider the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided furores. Usually, at the NFL final there are more than 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy ahead of us. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself during the national anthems due to protest against police force against blacks, and for this, among other things, had been taken hard by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 was performing was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and a Youtuber are joining Egypt's ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows back on the streets of Egypt have spent the past week abroad. One of the two was floating back on Friday at Cairo Airport. President Abdelgraph al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who laid off the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and did not lose a syllable of human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the President. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians cannot be led astray".
The other man's president, who is currently determining what's happening on the streets, is trying to get to the wrong place. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only as a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-setting voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tearooms: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are starving, the president swallows in luxury and allows himself to build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi relies his rule, rejects Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he did exactly this kind of business in his second job as a construction contractor for 15 years, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the click numbers just exploded.
For the first time since last week, after Sisi Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for this Friday to be a "million march". That really many people would venture into the streets was unlikely, but there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the city of China near Luxor. Videos showed in social media, which participants in Al-Sisi rejected corruption and demanded its departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were first not independently verified. The police said that the protests had ended.
From the city of Mansura in the Niledelta, where demonstrators broke last week banners with the portrait of the president in pieces, was reported massive police presence on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the downfall roads. Several metro stations in Cairo were closed for "maintenance work" in the city centre, most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, on which the followers of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi disappeared in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent that dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold here a big message for the president.
Mohamed Ali induced these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not run into police officers." However, as a retreater, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems much slower than the provider has applied, there are different testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not blindly have to trust the speed indications of the providers. Customers can check for how much of them is actually achieved in case of alerts.
Finally, the transfer rates promised above are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer center Bavaria.
If the connection is always much slower than applied by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the supplier's tests are carried out according to the supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the Bavarian Consumer Centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of time for the provider, usually 14 days, to produce the promised performance. The best way to do this is by writing a letter of formal notice.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and possibly also claim compensation. However, if there is no success, only the way to complain helps.
First rank Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has declared himself in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affairs before measures - an impeachment process can lead to the withdrawal of the President - are taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far used criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policy on several occasions, such as the relaxation of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Stays in MCU: Next Marvel-Film Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report agrees with several U.S. media. Accordingly, the film is supposed to be started in the USA as of July 16, 2021.
Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted in the magazine "Screenrant": "I am pleased that Spidey's way is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues working on his Spidery Verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come about the sudden good news? It seems that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate in Spider Man films with 30 percent revenue. However, the news is not confirmed.
So Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode, there were many Happy Ends and as well as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who took part in the series for many years, has been brought in charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One way forward: Duke Meghan did not return in the Finale for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed once again the most memorable scenes with the present-day Duke. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomes him after his sentence of imprisonment.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned occasionally in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51) Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a very significant remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a skirt, the perplexed Harvey of the bridegroom wants to know just to note in a nutshell: "Louis, you're not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned during a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died during the accident, as reported by the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Office (UNHCR). Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. He wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help with the management.
A speaker from the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers on Friday with EU Internal Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive unusually. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was called the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement, which was concluded in 2016, which allows the EU to return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to include a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian expelled.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only slow on the Greek side because of a lack of staff. Less than 29 400 people are hard on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had there been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" as one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years," said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature leaps within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for embarrassing photopanel
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was for this reason the cups manipulated?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a reusable cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has not been noticed for quite a long time - and finally it has been noticed. Elizabeth May, head of the Canadian Greens, has never held hands on the reusable cup of coffee with a metal straw. On the party’s website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a dirty (Papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green-shine has to be responsible for photopanel
The National Post then proposed manipulation and that the Fake News party produce to make it more credible on the subject of "environmental protection" in the middle of an election campaign for the Lower House election, where it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cups".
May showed up shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with the citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, was from bamboo. She always had him there. A speaker of the party said that it was only time to put the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo on the website is only to see a cut.
May writes, it's her grief for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself about her committed team: "If they want to edit a picture again, then they wouldn't be able to do something with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised because of their use of one-way plastic or flight trips to Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. The head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice with plastic spoons on holiday, as reported by markur.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Long flight ban at Cathay
It is alleged that Jaqueline Ng had been upgraded by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: One self-declared influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way, the Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade, even though they had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly had an upgrade in view. The letter wants to receive the influence from an airline marketing staff member. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline again tried to upgrade the long-haul flight. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they hacked at the central office. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly came was supposed to have cancelled the email contact with Jaqueline. That was confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1.280 euros), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay, while refunding her the price for her original ticket, also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains closed to future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on an attorney.
According to the report on cease-fire in Yemen, oil prices show
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time, a barrel (169 litres) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 USD - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 USD.
The trigger for the course slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world’s oil production to fail in mid-September. Huthi rebels in Yemen, allied with Iran, had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would reduce the political tension in the region.
If an agreement was actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past days. One week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Following the attack in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Bloomberg had recently reported, calling on Insider, that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster than expected. Consequently, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and was moving again towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press releases calling on insiders who report on the rapid progress of Saudi Aramco’s state oil group in repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Sena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leaving the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship was still anchoring, Reedereichf Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that defense missiles and soldiers would be transferred to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian ore enemy. The fear of escalating between the Islamic Republic and countries like the U.S. and Great Britain had made oil prices quite clear in recent weeks.
Alleged accusations against Trump amplify
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations have been made against the White House. Several leading government officials had worked hard to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous informant. The spokesman of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "distortion." Trump spoke of a "Hexen Hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diploma Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the agency KCNA.
The US had so far done nothing to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs consultant. He also criticised the tightening of US sanctions and the joint US and South Korea military manoeuvres. He hoped for a "wise" and "happy" Trump's decision to bring it back closer.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim was supposed to bring before he decided to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have taken place since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both then met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the consultations, but until now without great success.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry symbolically burned and destroyed a blast mine in Angola with a blue shattered vest. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. The explosives exploded at a safe distance. With a view to getting Angola unminded by 2025, he later called for ongoing TV cameras: "I call up all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get out of the way to commit themselves to help."
Pounds under pressure - Interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a rapid fall in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early reduction of the bank of England (BoE) are adding to sterling. On Friday, the British currency was reduced by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
The proceeds of the sales were statements by the notes banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rates into discussion, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned down, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy at a foreseeable time. This statement is surprising, as Saunders applied as a advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy by the Brexit hack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October, if necessary.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations. However, it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Oping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
New details of the Doping scandal in Russia are emerging at the start of the athletics World Cup - and they are destroying the little credibility that the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only initially. In January 2019 the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Oping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. The Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Russia) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games, allowed around 270 athletes of the country to enter under neutral flag in Rio, while 168 Russian athletes were at the start at the winter games in February 2018. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the different sports, even in the summer the football World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
Positive findings missing
In the following September Wada lifted the Rusada banner again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data were manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have identified numerous differences between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organisation to hold on to Russia’s ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed blockade of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
