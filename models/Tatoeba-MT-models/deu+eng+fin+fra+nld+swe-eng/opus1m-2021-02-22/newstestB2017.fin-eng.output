28-year-old chef found dead in a Sanfranciscola shopping mall
Just recently moved to San Francisco's 28-year-old cook was found dead in the local shopping mall stairs this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his case in order."
The body found at the Westfield mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Franciscoian Frank Galicia, reports about San Francisco’s forensics office.
According to San Francisco Police Department, death is investigated as a life penalty.
Brother Louis Galicia told the KGO radio station in San Francisco of the television company ABC that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream work when he came to San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant as chef six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and close team, like a family, and we're sorry we're big," says the representative.
"Our ideas are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in the hostes, but he had finally gotten his order.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and great-hearted.
His way to be together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the power.
Despite all the wrongs that are happening in the world, he was an unbridled diamond, which sounded every day," he says.
All wise men are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Breaking Junior Physicians Require New Work Fighting
UK junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their union and requested permission for new work-related measures in the context of a dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee for Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Association of Physicians (BMA) is seeking support from the whole government for further work in the fight against unemployment from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who participated in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the JDC Committee, published a letter to members of the JDC on Twitter, saying that the government was "abstinent" about issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter says: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted against a completely new draft agreement and calls for all our concerns to be addressed through new formal negotiations.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government requesting permission for the progressive expansion of labour struggles from the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, the junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first perfect jobs ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of the BMA Junior Physicians, resigned from his duties after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
At the pre-vote meetings of the members of the BMA, Malawana said that the agreement was good and should be accepted, involving 54 000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would come into force and would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: External Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to reach an agreement and to bring to an official conclusion the eight-month war on words and the economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish brother Peter’s palace in the golden hall, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was Ankara.
The parties did, they did.
But Putin's smile seemed weak and he didn't really heat up even with his own pretentious measure.
On the other hand, Mrs. Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of "good friend" Mr. Putin – one report says five times.
I didn't keep my bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s newspapers wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood her enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the head of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was furious.
Putin strictly attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing his back.
The injury was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real confidence.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious accusations of top officials were that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Isis-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
However, the official message from Peter was that it is time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only held in order for Putin to receive his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could thus gain some sort of victory.
The benefits of declaring a strict truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There are also financial implications for the agreement.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter ban, because, normally, millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be able to overcome the problems of ease when air transport can eventually continue.
They're putting their faith in a late-song rush to the Mediterranean.
And again this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Turried there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in the magazine Vedemost's article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Anger is angry with the West, because it feels that the West is reacting to the coup.
Without forgetting the old grudge of progressing towards the speed of Turkish accession negotiations and the absence of Putin, Putin, who is eager to make use of the cool spaces and to break Turkey's ties west.
Undoubtedly, the Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own preoccupation with the change of power.
Russia and Turkey, therefore, were able to convey the image of the "external alliance" described by one analyst: two countries, who felt that they had been rejected and treated the West, joined forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two continue to have major differences.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of country differences, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where to seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO member Turkey in shooting down a Russian fighter plane, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are once again in the middle of a speech.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing its customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland are reduced in such a way that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was initially linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to reverse its objectives when it almost collapsed eight years ago and was forced to save.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored international sports with millions of pounds, such as Six Nations-rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national fires go.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used for a discount on RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, with the exception of the main office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS becomes an investment brand and therefore, in the service of our staff, because we are now turning much more into a bank for different types of brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts are now no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nationsrugby and has raised the profile of different brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"Now it's the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically it's about how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's managing director.
"It would have been very good three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put the brands in use.
But the work we do and the focus on customers' needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those fires back, so I think time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predlection to victory in Newmarket and won 3,000.
The dettor sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant him 3,000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
On this pedigree he reached his horse riding Predlection twice on the same night on the track of his own locality. Predlection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race-track.
He's got the same before, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time Master Jockey Dettor, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface, because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket, because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-spirit audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Detector receives cheers with Predlection after winning
Two jockeys have reached the five-foot barrier race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4 300 times on his record career.
Lester Piggott, ninth Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that it is precisely he who reached this milestone, which has only been reached by a few.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical range is what separates him from others.
He's a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his charisma have brought to the species supporters for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 races, unless he would compete only in weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in British races has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for the British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor fanned his achievement in a familiar way by flying down his horse’s back.
"From flying goal income to flying down income, Frankie Dettor has been a model example of British competition for two decades.
There's a lot of uphills and downhills.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived the flight accident and been in a competition ban due to drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had initial difficulties in starting up, but he showed the admirable nature of strength, appeared to his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while he is still not stopping his career – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue his career as a competitor until at least 50 years of age."
Putin dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putin's trusted interior for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin's press release, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from office as head of the Russian presidential administration", but the grounds for dismissal were not reported.
Anton Vaino, deputy head of Ivanov, was appointed as Deputy Head of Mission since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
In Tallinn in 1972, Vaero graduated from a prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he headed the president’s protocol department and the government office, says the Russian website of Kremlin.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment, saying, "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task for the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means making legislative proposals and monitoring how your guidelines are being implemented."
Putin told Russian television company Friday that Ivanov had himself requested a divorce and recommended Persecution to his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long belonged to Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he also has a history of KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin at the Russian State Television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his duties at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are very few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Is the result of some kind of power struggle fired?
Nobody knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man named President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, saying: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I've served as the President's Chief Executive Officer for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin served as head of the FSB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Head of the Federation Security Service (FSB).
As Putin entered power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
In time it was thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second period, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, Dmitri Medvedeville, who was close to Putin, was assigned the task.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned as president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – Star of the FBI Investigators series Thomas Gibson was fired after beating the producer
Gibson was involved in a local violent dispute in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce a series, reported fired in their joint press release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner of the Gibson series had made an apology on Thursday before he was informed of his resignation.
"We had creative disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his press release.
The details of how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, will be published later, will be reported in the release of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously, in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series for its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his press release on Friday.
"I was hoping I'd see it until the end of the show, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group, and most importantly, the best fans of what a series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th series will start on September 28th in the United States.
Fish mysterious beaching in the Banffle Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been paralyzed by a whirlwind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seafront, published a screen of visual material in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five - cent fishes.
The crossing of Queensferry is now connected to Fife
The GBP 1,35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the North Deck and the Land Bridge of Queensferry, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four parts between the "cover belts" which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 pine groves.
The GBP 1,35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Finance, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the bridge across the Queensferry.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of a bridge, with more than 30,000 concrete and steel used for the construction of this bridge section alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the shoreline and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now almost 79% in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete filling in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised."
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge part is always a major urea in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction sector.
When the last section of the road deck had been installed and connected to the road deck on the North Tower pillar, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the underground) gap.
This was done by drawing 700 mm southwards from the northern side of the hillside.
This was a massive operation and, at the same time, a great deal of precision.
Massive because of the length of 222 metres and the weight of some 6,000 tonnes, it had to be pulled up at an angle of approximately 3 per cent.
And the need for great precision, because the tolerances that the team had to observe were very small — only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells us about three men's miracle rescue
Three men from their fishing boat in the water were saved as if in a miracle store.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alarm on Friday at 1:20 local time in the Bay of Moelfre.
Three men desperately tried to swim in safety while their boat continued its unhindered course without a director.
"We saw a boat orbiting right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, the lifeboat driving Moelfre.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two men, while the third, 60-year-old, was found exhausted in the hedge and without a life vest.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men from the water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat had an emergency switch on the engine, but for some reason it had been disconnected from the man who had seen the boat fall.
They had real luck on their way."
Pokémon Go after brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside to stare at their roses.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and on the move.
Initially the screen time took only television viewing, then came in addition to video games and the latest smartphones.
So it's amazing to note that technology and outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application, whose characters originate from video games created in the 1990s (which were later also made with cartoon series, playing cards and other related products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to the enormous interest that overburdened the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost the same as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, the players will go out to search their smartphones for pokémons, which are monitored by GPS. When you find pokémon, it can be "photographed" (with the help of a phone screen image) or "hidden".
Wildity has trodden with his video game as a younger generation and raised the back of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average tax person" per day.
Washington Post recently reported that the Apple Watch intelligence application, which observed within two days of the game launch, suddenly rose from 45% to 53% in 30 minutes per day. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company does not know who the user is playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of the exercise volumes.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get up on the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have been listening to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
Regularly mobile probability of developing cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The great thing about the Pokémon Go game is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
This achieves three health-supporting basics — exercise, fresh air, and sun, and joy.
It is possible to have even new friends during the yacht.
As usual, this phenomenon, too, includes detestable joys.
And yes, someone can play walking around the door.
What about it?
The breakthrough's done.
Although smart phone applications such as Fitbit might have previously followed your activity, they did not give reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The new attraction will disappear, and the use will decrease in time.
However, the success of the pokémons will increase the number of games in which applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise of hunting people and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Bales caught gold in the women's platforming diversification
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the jump.
Simone Bales is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
I'm in trouble.
You're gonna have to do a loafing on the perman.
That's great for everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old U.S. Shipman won the diversity championship and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lights.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of the silver-backed "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze Italian Alya Mustafina.
The U.S. Simone Biles will be performing in the finals of the Women's Platforming Individual Competition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday 2016.
The ball became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all ages who won the championship of diversification. Thus, he strengthened his reputation as the best generation of his generation or even as the best of all ages.
Biles burst into tears when his overall final score came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to completely new dimensions and raises it to the same class of sports with other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said he was the "most awesome platformer of all time".
In Brazil, there was one last competition, which took place, above all, between Bales and himself and the burden of the exorbitant expectations, not just between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisma hug after winning gold and silver for women's car racing in individual competition finals on Thursday in Rio 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
On Tuesday, the first gold medal was won by Bales as a point I over the country team coordinated and now retired by Martha Karoly.
Although Bales claimed that he never thought anything prematurely when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes a Volt series known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard in the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When her grandparents were little adopted and coached by Aimee Boorman's mother, she became a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl when she was on a day-care trip to the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning line is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Blackfina got a little lead on two laps, it was like canvasing.
There was a boom and a permanto where Bales is the defending world champion.
He got back to the leading position after obtaining 15,433 points from around and crowned the final result from the permannium at 15,933 points.
Raisman gently hugged him while waiting for the final points — which was just a formality — and the tears began to appear around the bordering color of Bales, red, white and blue, when his once - written dream came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rucksack to a four-year-old competition when he first awarded third place but then lost the bronze to Blackfina in the rerun.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team "grand" was clearly blackfine above.
He sent air passes to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from a defeat position to a winner, which seemed uncertain in the meantime.
As far as the party is concerned, this wide-ranging tweet, which was made earlier in the 19-year-old's earlier week, now has a completely new meaning:
The police report that three musics in the car were the victim of a serial killer who listened to him in the car.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix’s most devastating mass murder in ten years. The victims were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports the police news release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then fled with another car, the press release says.
The police suspect that there was no robbery because the attacker didn't take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the custody of another adult victim.
Detective Jonathan Howard, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the killing is related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin American Americans within four months.
"It is common ground for them to have happened in residential areas in the presence of the home," Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are interrelated and that the author is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, immediately died at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a press release that reported a blank fire at the open-range van only half an hour before the third death, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The scientists found casings and took a bullet from the car's seat and a bullet from the engine mode.
Mother of a 6-year-old son with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has a microcephaly, or congenital minority, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto’s genetic disorder of which she was not aware when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was I won't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and perhaps not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to propose the placement of a child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think it was any more," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with a scooter.
Edmund got up and started the ass when he was only 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is presenting a signage invented by Edmund, which means "sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean the usual sign language, but it also includes the orphans invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly may have a number of different diseases: hereditary, such as the case of Edmund, or pregnant viral infections, such as scavenger or zika virus.
The symptoms and forecasts are very variable.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those affected by zica virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "What happens to us,
what happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope for advice to mothers whose children have problems with zica virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to be orderly.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
The floods and floods caused major rescue operations in the state of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared an emergency situation due to severe rains and widespread floods. More rains in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in south-eastern and south-eastern Mauritius flowed across their shores and spread to the vast area as a result of heavy rains.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tells us that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already on the way to flood zones.
Mike Steele, the governor of the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Agency, tells us that the agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangiphahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
According to the weather service news, the area may have an additional 76 to 127 mm.
South Alabama was given flood warning on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of the rivers may be flooded under the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding in the county of Ascension is a threat, as the flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows southwards the Mississippi border in Louisiana Liverpool, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amit and Wilkinson in the South-Missip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandson, were previously on Friday near Gloster, among those saved.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He was warned by the other half of the boy who lived nearby.
"We got up, and the water came with continuous feeding," says Hansford.
"It stretched into my belt."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years of her living in the area.
Hansford tells us that he himself and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only swimmer of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three to the great army - style truck and had taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly, as heavy rain continues, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of the observation from the observer near Livingston that almost 350 mm had been caught between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was strongly baptized after the rains began on Wednesday.
The authorities report that because of the heavy rains and the flooding of the streets, the residents of the Tangiphaho district were forced to save their homes and the school hours were cancelled in five schools.
The member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told CBS subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has spread to both of them.
The head of the congregation, Robby Miller, tells us that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pet animals who had remained trapped in the flood.
The evacuees have been opened for shelters in the cities of Amit and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangiphaho, nearly twenty streets were closed due to the flood, and sand bags were offered to residents, which they could try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Government.
"This flood seems similar."
At Mississippi, the rains continued even on the Gulf coast, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday there were reports of a stormy flood in the house, but no information had yet been received on Friday.
The manager of Shopper Value Foods, Keith Townson, tells us that he has been in Amite for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets in his body, six-year-old Mahaj Brown, survives the Philadelphia shooting interval
According to the police, in Philadelphia, there's been a six-year-old boy who's already another six-year-old who's been shot in the city this week.
Children’s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several bullet wounds in his joints, legs, arms and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his small body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has been subjected to several surgery.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting his first class at the local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
The target was also two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found at the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether another of the wounded men could have been a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault-type shells originating from various assault-weapons.
"It is perfectly clear that this was the ongoing battle.
The street had casings on both sides of the corridor.
There have been several armed fighters on site and they have actively participated in the shooting," Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to the hearing, the police are going through surveillance videos.
One of the six-year-old victims of a shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand hit a delusion when she was playing Tuesday in front of her home in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I call the women's Olympic team on the platform, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, this team of three powermen, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, which complements the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin-speaking women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female powerman in the world has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
In the previous Olympic Games Gabby Douglas rose as a surprise winner of the races, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible achievements of three-time world champions Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterful works of works.
Simone became a fourth consecutive American on Thursday, winning gold in the women’s individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisma won the silver.
Such visions are at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be seen in yard power lessons throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They're five of the last ("Final Five"), because the next Olympic Championship for Shipbuilding will have only four powermen, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that carpentry is a expensive sport and carpentry is mainly practiced in private carpentry euros that maintain their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, accommodation, travel, entertainment, competitive fees, hotel fees (trainers, gyms and family members) etc.
The facilities of the majority of the works are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The teaching of the Teline Powers takes place in these clubs, and it means expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the Powers.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have both trained the breed's enthusiasts since they started the shipyard operation.
We need to provide a more affordable and more accessible training for young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own docking foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for a workshop exercise for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American) and these young people have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to our home city of Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality carpentry power to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Teline powering develops strength, strength and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm for thousands of young girls who now want to start carpentry, and it's just amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic Gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for new strikes
Ministers wanted to decide on changes to remuneration and working conditions by approving a trade union representing doctors in the renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the 37 000 so-called junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt told us about plans to get the agreement out of hand and said that the British Public Health System (NHS) was "no one in the country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will enter into a new agreement, which will introduce changes to the practice of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Yesterday evening, Mr McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee of Junior Physicians, delivered an opinion saying: "The legal doctors still have a very reserved view of the proposed agreement, which is particularly afraid that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we now need to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even in no way responding to the debate.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors will be ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike suspended nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strikers in the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the trade union representing the British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend for 54 000 junior doctors to be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to engage in new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Fighting operations are achieved very little or nothing, but they create pressure on already extreme-bound teams and services and cause care, distress and disturbances to patients, nursing staff and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
Workers were hopeful that a continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, further training returning from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, student-free and gender pay gap in the care sector – were a sign of the seriousness of the workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health, responsible for health education, wishing to abide by the agreements concluded with the BMA in Mar, February and May."
A daily dose of around € 2.40 can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are taking approximately €2.40 a day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and to longer-term use.
The anti-convulsion medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already being given for 12 months after the heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatment methods, has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people receive a heart attack every year, of which a quarter are re-emerging or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fat from the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is released, it can go along with the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new stroke is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, then reduced to 60 mg and that aspirin be given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Although there are effective treatment methods available to prevent the progression of disease and the emergence of symptoms effectively, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on the quality of human life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of a treatment method for longer than that recommended.
Due to a climate of political correctness, the voter’s fervor in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled from office last year due to corruption, as a result of which the government issued a report.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from the widespread election in Muslim communities, a report published today by the government.
Sir Eric Pickles, the former government minister, strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councillors for turning their eyes to election because of "exaggeration to ethics and religion".
According to Pickles, the fear of voters for religious reasons, known as the former minister of regional government and today's anti-corruption force, was so bad that the police should have allowed the formation of security chains outside the polls that they could have been protected.
He proposed that voters should submit an identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they came to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only state his or her name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize the fingers in the ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to the air carriers, says Sir Eric.
He called for greater access for journalists to Council documents and decisions by informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to combat corruption and financial fraud and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the election scandal of the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should resign from his duties because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The Court considered that Rahman "wrongly" his Muslim community's religious feeling and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islam.
Rahman was said "to use his campaign as the basis for the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him".
Of the sounds, up to 300 were in doubt or were given in a way that the person voted by making another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of the flu from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal protests in which members of the high-ranking Muslim community were told that people had been pressured to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric (see picture) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some members of ethnic minorities in vulnerable positions, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such action because of "politically correct" ethnicity and hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the handling of post-voting flags by political activists, in order to prevent the "removal of voices".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks in connection with the registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights in cases of immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of options where voters would be required to present an identity certificate before voting.
Soaking your fingers in unbound ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of the handling of mail mail and mail envelopes by political activists.
Police right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise charges of intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English to vote at polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure that the staff monitor the rule that only one person should go to the polls at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it "surprising" that after the case of Tower Hamlet, no criminal charges were brought.
"The Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for the purpose of corruption and numerous unlawful practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without a suspicion, and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "intelligence checks" carried out by the branches responsible for the electoral lists of the city council.
"The decision of the Court of Justice last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a revival," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatening the worrying and covert election fraud and the denial of it by some."
Olympic biker equality with Duchess Catherine and other doubles wild at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were wild in a French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose consistency with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete fighting for a championship who has the same appearance as a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio races and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose consistency with Hollywood posters is obvious.
Forester and wolf: The US men's suspension team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duke Catherine's double being, many people have noted in social media how a bowship could be an actress's favourite Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the American men's archery team, caused a storm after the photos published on Twitter that he exclaimed as a star in the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that he had already heard from the child that he was reminiscent of DiCaprio.
"I don't see the equality so great, with the exception of beards and mustaches," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London races, British long-distance riders Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were confronted with the same appearance, which is undoubtedly even more evident in these races.
The great and obvious-eyed Russian powerman Aliya Mustafina has been called the twin being of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
In turn, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known from the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "an athletic version" of the Inception movie.
Similarly, for a long time there has been noted equality between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, which highlights both strong eyebrows and lips.
The silver-plated swim player, Yulia Efimova from Russia reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of his beautifully tanned skin and hair, while Nathan Adrian from the United States team, according to his fans, is "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the actors of the Dexter series Jennifer Carpenter (right), remind each other of their face shape and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when the others also saw the equality.
This user is wondering if there's a good reason for a couple to be equal.
A tweeter recently expressed his joy when "the others on the Internet agree on the equality of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and Dexter series actors are awe-inspiringly reminiscent of each other's face shape and eyes.
Many have also seen the equality of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney in the smiles and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna come back!, starring Gabrielle Union in the broad smiles.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "dead as pigs"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in the women's 4 x 200-metre freeskiing message struck the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian radio company CBC has had to apologize after one of its uncommentable speakers said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "lost smells" and "dead like pigs" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to launch his own opinions on the finals of the women's 4 x 200 m free-dancing message.
MacDonald, who was taken into the CBC explanation team to bring the color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
It was too excited, went fast, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim at the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and stayed for 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed the Canadians to benefit from China.
Visitors across Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swim in the finals of the women's 4 x 200 meters freeskiing message, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious Byron MacDonald’s critical comments, and many demanded his resignation.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard byron Macdonald's disregard.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist people.
Scott Russell, who was the host of the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's words: "We apologize for the comment on the bathing performance.
It was a sad choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC eventually regretted more than 90 times the people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russell had to complain on behalf of MacDonald.
Then the CBC copied and glued his regret to more than 90 other tweeters who complained about MacDonald’s speech.
The TV company also made a quick public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for their success in sending.
In yesterday’s broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers and also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret at the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that it was not meant to be personal.
"I would like to apologize for my comment that I gave yesterday evening after the women's broadcast," MacDonald said in CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Not to say, it is clear that I did not mean anything demeaning by my words, and I am very sorry."
At Primark, a woman in the middle of the shop was shocked by her underwear.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to make arrangements for underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing how he looked in underwear, took them off his feet and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her tour and finally tried four under-suppers at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark chain shop in Folkestonen Bouverie Place where a woman tried underwear for everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, reports that after trying out underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People were not believers in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the shop, took underwear from the shelf, took off her own jersey and underwear and put them on.
He did not try to do it unobtrusively, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone stared when he took away the underwear he had tried, and apparently he didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided not to wear anything, dress and walk out.
He did not seem to care about the eyes — nor did he seem to think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had set."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking the underwear that someone else has used and has not washed them."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the trade staff sought to remove those garments from the sale when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be awful to take the new underwear home and notice that someone else has come after them without having washed them off," adds Davidson.
The primary editor commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware on Tuesday 9 August of the situation in the Folkestone movement.
All these products have been removed from sale."
This is how you defend yourself against the armed attack with the help of Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked for advice on how to survive the gun from a nearby robber or an illiterate.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches for you or behind.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first step is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the face with your elbow open.
Then kick the attacker down his knee, and when he goes from pain to pain twice, slap him on his face with a gun and pull him away by holding the gun toward him.
The technique is similar if an assailant approaches the front. You have to move away from the shooter line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the weapon and strike the attacker with your fists into the chest.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video and see how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, though, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash — unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
World traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveller put his resistance and capricious reflexes to the hard test by licking Europe's most dirty and despicable places.
Supholkian runner and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove their resistance by licking euro banknotes, handcuffed in Piccadilly Circuit, the train's toilet flush button and Russian public phone.
Before licking Wright measured the objects with luminometers to see for itself and to show viewers what was forbidden to push.
The experiment was a documentary film based on Ian Wright – Internal Force, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet flush of the train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sinks.
On their way to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening good bacteria in the intestine and about their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad taste.
Ian Wright initially became known for his travel program in which he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Undoubtedly, the licking of the handrails of the railway stations and the flushing button on the toilet challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document, "I've been rather carefree about my health ever since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, like mud, worms, and throat."
In the film, he really showed himself to be very famous.
Raja only came against in a dirty public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
In the light of the comparison, it should be noted that in the counterwashed hands the amount is usually less than 60.
The border arrived in the Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured the result of 4,000 units — the same figure in the counterwashed hands is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in the documentary film Ian Wright – Internal Force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film after Ian Wright – Internal Force in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, was given the Wright team to help strengthen the good bacterial coverage and resistance of the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and, at the same time, tells of the benefits of the probiotics.
We spent a lot of time imagining something crazy, and eventually we ended up asking Ia for it."
The health of Finland has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them closer to our daily environment, to good and bad bacteria, to the health of the intestines, and to tell us how it relates to resistance.
The health of Finland has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the items that we asked for, such as the Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, the licking of some targets was easier for Ian, while some were rather bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
84% of respondents in the survey in 2015 included lactic acid bacteria in particular in the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products with added lactic acid bacteria.
He destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before he was killed.
After 50 000 pounds of damage to the city’s rental house after they had received an emergency neighborhood terror.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from her apartment in Cornwall, Saltash, after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been compulsively removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company stated that they were shocked by the apartment being renovated.
The walls had arsonable openings, the floor wagons had been torn off, the trash had been spread over the floors and the walls had been tainted with graffiti.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Cornwall Housing Manager Donna McEvoy says he's afraid he might not be able to save the apartment.
He says, "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, and no one should have to endure this.
There is a lot to weigh, as the property is likely to become known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is well-known, as is its name."
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment at times. According to the police, the family’s horrors included street fights with baseball bats, the intimidation of nearby residents, the use and transmission of drugs, and loud screaming, quarreling and cursing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement in June, received a decree on non-social behaviour.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house that was under the guise of unloading.
The house had previously sold drugs, and the floor wagons had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police were regularly called.
Cornwall's housing agency evicted the couple's coercive efforts this week, first giving them 11 weeks of extra time to voluntarily move out.
Delighted neighbors were grateful for the wedding — they said their life was an earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living with them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we haven't used to it!
It's going to be wonderful now that they've finally been married."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Head of the Cornwall Housing Enforcement Agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which police were regularly invited to attend.
Rosk and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It's a shame that the tenant didn't take any responsibility for his or her family's behaviour, because rejection is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing agency is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighbor.
I am grateful to my group, to the police at Devon and Cornwall, and to the members of the community who took part in the work and were courageously offering us information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of neighbours and give the message that unsocial behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom after the wedding
Housing workers now have to clean up the waste piles surrounding the house.
The police made a ride to the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and other supplies, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined after he was found guilty of possession of Class B drug for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money to be his in 2013 car accident for his dead son Lee Skeldon's tombstone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told to move to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms had been covered with graffiti.
The police say they're demanding that the landlords who violate the lease rules should be dismissed.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this is a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without prosecution, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Lowly flown, shore-dipped army shower machine scared the tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed to a very low level.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to flee when the low-flying jet fell over the full shore.
Dramatic pictures show how the military aircraft is coming to a distance close to the sandy beach from the tourists who take the sun in northern Portugal in Aveiro.
The holidaymakers got to their feet when they were worried about the jet of the jet engines that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The case happened last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of the vacationers published in the social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and it was a moment when it looked like it was falling down."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveiro experienced a shock when the plane suddenly appeared and flew low.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight with the aim of identifying the coastal fishing vessels, so that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little low, because the smoke caused by the near forest fires was harmful to visibility, but according to air forces this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility of the sank and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exotic first half result better than expected
In January - June, the Southern Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) achieved a better planned result of EUR 3.4 million.
The ex-ante result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to break down institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will seek to shorten the number of lines of action.
The premium covers the deficit created by the past surplus.
The excess portion may be used to reduce queues and to purchase measures for patients.
The overall result of the year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten Government will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border icers swore a military oath in Immola
Of the 70 officers of the Border and Marine Guard School, they swore a military oath on Friday.
The military election of the shipowners of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special ice reserve course was held at the equipment sports field.
The military jury swore 70 of the shipmen.
Special border icers are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special ice cream.
250 of them were invited to the tests.
Since 2007, there have been training courses for special ice-creamers in Immola.
During the election, five veterans of the border forces participated in the veterans’ meeting.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans on the occasion were born in 1918.
Predeterminant delinquency - criminal intelligence helps to resolve crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each 11 Finnish police facilities have been operated by the RTA, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlin are in the Hämeenlin Police Department.
It's drawn by Lahti's established sergeant.
Lieutenant Lahti is a cover manager.
In addition, the unit's strength includes the dedicated information technology for civilians in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian facility.
The Unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, according to Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the other police.
Among other things, it has obtained information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would be more and less likely to go to war until they get an alarm.
With the help of information collected and analysed by the Unit, daily police activity is targeted where it is most needed.
In the course of the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence unit was set up in the country, with less than three national units and each of their own criminal intelligence units.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is a national leader.
The PTR units work in accordance with the name of the people from the Police, Tull and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work according to the police departments in the divided areas and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA mission is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of one’s own institution, as it does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better basic police skills.
By means of the registers, the alert database and the findings, the Unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, prolific criminal or similar crimes.
This is called "splitting", and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain type of image is formed.
An assignment can be made either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit are not able to move their necks in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
There is no mention of the methods used by criminals, either on their own or on their own, because this could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus to an attempt to prevent police anti-criminal activities.
The method of the police will be publicly reported if it anticipates a threat to them.
This was the case, for example, with the early - summer news, the way of marking empty dwellings used in house breakage.
In it, the makers put a stick, a needle or a piece of tape on the outside of the apartment, which they tried to find out if the residents were actually traveling.
The screening material shall be publicly available to at least the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from mistakes.
The nocturnal protocol of the district court, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found at the place.
The next time we steal, we'll leave the gloves with our hands.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppa from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that will allow them to plan their activities in practice.
Background for the reduction in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the institutions and Finnish borders.
The London schoolgirl, associated with his fathers, was killed in Syria
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined Dad last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Counsel Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in Russian air in Raqqa, which is the Isis base in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family, she was just planning to flee the war from the country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will so that people can understand that this is a real risk to the war zone - and that will get people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, in conjunction with the other two East London schoolgirls, Sultana went to a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senator Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic President candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Senator Major General Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of Judge Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court of the former Supreme Court.
At the telephone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he was predicting Clinton to choose Garland "with great certainty."
The editor of Reid later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton if this was going to be called Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "get a boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Reid says the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are president candidate Donald Trump's "cookers" and "conductors".
He says Trump doesn't fit into office.
According to the Treads magazine, naked calendars are just as good for women as for men.
The Treads magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market the 1970s-style and Pirell inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of public secret models, they want to find top models for the next generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nakedness sparked his magazine to depart from the old school Playboy magazines, for he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this for women."
Apparently, he's thinking about the calendar the same way.
"We need to bring back timeless and classical nakedness, in which women, where men too, can easily enjoy these images of praise for women and be inspired by them," says Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
A model for calendars can be sent through the network or take part in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on your angry objection with the name EiväAll GentileMen of the Middle Ages, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to yourGov research company, the new arrival of a lot of spoken vinyl discs is not a generation buumi of the millennium when the Millennials want to feel their hands with physical object, but instead the background has middle-life nostalgia.
The most likely age for a person who recently bought vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of hobbyists to catch records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy isolation (69% vs. 66%).
But do YouGovi's results match?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me walking along Soho Street, on top of me a gray, unspoiled dress. I would boldly eject, bend my hand into a cup and say something about the traditions, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and its rosyness, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have conquered the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still handfuls of special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and nature.
Glasgow, Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at the moment eight middle-aged men, probably one of the 20 women) is on a meeting trip in London during the afternoon and spends their extra time exploring the supply of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4000 records."
These records fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so much albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He now is able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he had had to sell as a young and moneyless person.
"I got a lot of stuff from the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that buying vinyl records is more likely to be introverts that please themselves in their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my worst."
Wez, 25 in Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of human stream that has been influenced by the media hypothesized. These people have heard about the re-entry of vinyl plates and now feel compelled to buy back their old ones.
"As a result of my discussions, people had usually given up their collections at places in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the buum of a certain age of vinyl alarm.
And then what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In just a few seconds, a movement like Phonica realizes that they offer comfort to similar-spirited types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been harmed by the contactless payment system in particular.
The digital world may be taunting part of vinyl fans, to whom returning to familiar disk cases means durability and reminds of the youthful days of happiness.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or a material property is acquired in some form of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so many others too.
It is an easy way to get thoughts elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!"
The April ICM Milipide Study revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to their album.
The Mielipide Study also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the vinyl buyers do not have their own record player at all.
At this point in the newscast, I'd probably look like a serious face as I went to the stacking bo-nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl discs is also associated with the "pocal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, the salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (as clients at that time three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"There is not a large proportion of such customers, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, to which I come next. The movement is owned by a whole layer of vinyl plates.
The customers are seven-tenths of pairs, photography tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of the customers rejoices, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: the sounding noises instead of rocking jazz, the latest sex of Wild Beast's synthesisor pop.
None of the customers seem to be particularly lonely, but a bald psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes and watched various discs in the drop.
He's more like watching than buying.
He tells me that his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They pay a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the subtlety of the winery is ...", he lets go of the adored pore and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop called Urban Outfitters, which is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think of a skipping pygmy species, but who instead gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras. I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley CD player.
On the left is a staircase filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main records in any average collection.
No one is looking at the wall, perhaps because they are only interior elements and part so high that they don't even reach.
They're pure "art vinyl".
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money in the sector and send some customers to a hack trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population most likely to have more time and money than most have, at the same time, the group that uses the most money for luxury, such as vinyl discs.
Although the results of my research are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female and vinyl fans who actually exist in both record stores and online platforms.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or working life.
I'm sure they won't be spending their Thursday mornings in the record stores of Berwick Street, browsing the records and avoiding the 30-year-old TV-maker who stare fearlessly and blinds men of the mean age who are uninvited.
Holker, i.e. ice shark, is the longest live vertebrate – video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrae on earth is ice shark.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice cream age in the study was 272-512 years, a five-metre-long female.
The French court rejected the application to terminate the trade in jungle camps
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants by thousands of refugees in jungle camps.
At the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to break down 72 temporary trades established in refugee camps, which sell different kinds of tobacco to the refugee camp residents and provide hair-cuts, and that tea can be bought at 50 cents or basic meals at a few euros.
According to Calais's prefectiaries, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve risks of fire and hygiene.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals provided by the state-supported organisation and other actors are not sufficient for the growing crowd of residents of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but the concern of the prefect of Calais was "fully understood".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp have a much greater significance than food for people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat was the Jungle Book Kids camp, which is non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors whose position is most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed up to the address where the children’s café is required to be kept.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, assessed on Friday that after the sharp increase in summer numbers, the number of people living in jungle camps has risen to a record population of over 9,000.
Box prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
In Finland, food falls sharply to the delight of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of wine in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are from the article published in the Tieto & Trends blog, published by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Journalinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
Food prices rose sharply in the early 2010s.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The import bans on food imposed by Russia now weigh the price, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-group and Kesko have both fallen their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as a great advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a source of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a level of pay similar to Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the countries in question had the same rate of VAT they would be sold to the third lowest-priced countries in Finland.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT were in the seven countries in question, only German and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finnish.
"If we want to get to the old EU level in food prices, we have to halve VAT to the EU's average level and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The press points out that his VAT percentage calculations are indicative.
The school's not exactly what it used to be anymore.
Returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic year in all sub-schools.
It is an instruction that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautification is abandoned, and instead schools are beginning to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of pupils.
In the past, it was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This way they try to make school more interesting.
The longest spine in the world was found - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even ice sharks, known as Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), achieves reproductive maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live after another 250 years, report on a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest vertebrae in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it only bypasses an Icelandic pig whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507 years.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch beyond dogs, they can grow to over five metres.
Due to the slow growth rate, the monitoring shows that only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been living with the highest number of people for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues made it clear.
He defined the age of 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon testing of eye lenses.
The average age of examined sharks was at least 272 years.
The sample’s two largest fish, 493 and 502 cm amazons, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, researchers have calculated that they are at that stage about 150 years of age.
The study was published in Science.
From Stockmann to almost 300 sellers are not deducted
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from the department store Stockmann.
At the beginning of August, the cooperative companies ended in difficulty.
"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be taken as redundancies", says Stockmann in his press release.
It states that the number of dealers in the goods sector will not be reduced in order to ensure that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
The Stockmann negotiations concerned some 3 000 workers.
At the beginning of the reduction, approximately 380 employees were expected to be employed.
The people’s reduction aims at an annual cost saving of around EUR 20 million, which is to be implemented in the next year.
Mr Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme which is intended to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background to this is Stockmann's difficulty in getting a profit from the department store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the retail trade continues to make losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann's CEO, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, personal adjustments are necessary to ensure the positive business result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", says Veijalainen in the newsletter.
In the second quarter, the result was particularly successful in the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved its best second quarter turnover and earnings.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was 4.1 million in loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees Fahrenheit
The centre of low pressure on the north of Finland will hold the weather on rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but the southerly part will be rough.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the north of the rainy areas, 10-15 will remain.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes a doping scandal with a strange explanation for the trick of coach
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent from the Rio Olympics home after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in the doping test.
The AP reported that an athlete in which Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, who was in Kenya’s national team leadership, said that the identity of Anzrah was revealed after he had passed a surprise test on Rotichina.
The doping officials went to the authorities in Anzrah.
Soin says Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept that," says Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, in turn, told Reuters.
Olympic general sports start on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run right away.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich finished last year in the World Cup in fourth place and is ahead of Rio's winners.
According to Reuters, the source within Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah was travelling with an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed him to be an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of being exposed," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s general sports show is emptying
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they're not watching public sports.
On Friday the struggle for the medals of general sport began in Rio, but the world’s top individuals were able to show their skills to a confusing empty audience.
The organisers of Rio said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first morning competition and 65% of the tickets for the evening competition have been sold.
Another four years ago, in London, where the stadium hurried a cheering crowd.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have attracted attention even before public sports.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the rugby, noise and riding seats.
When Brazilian medalists in Talita Antunes and Lar Franca played beach football in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the seats were full.
After the Brazilian strike, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people were more full.
The bad way to go at least explains that Brazil is far away from Europeans and Asians in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilians who are used to football.
Indeed, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not be filled with the football stadium.
During the weekend, newscaster Mario Andrada reported that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left for sale," says Reuters, Andrada.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold by the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have changed from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000.
More than half of the tickets pay less than €16.
At the Olympic Games in London, volunteer workers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have issued 240 000 tickets for lesser-known species such as golf and rug.
In the morning, the Rio Stadium was full of empty places.
Not even a beach football ball with Copacaba's sand has any interest in the audience.
Jukka Keinsalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people on the press.
New way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by the latest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
Subsequently, individuals, businesses and communities can make money available to landowners' rights.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land has been virtually divided into blocks which are available to the interested parties against payment of the right of ownership.
The holder has a right of veto of a block of 187 square metres, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the intended use of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired in more areas.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be left as a inheritance or as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or tie yourself up somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired a right of management in his company.
Those who acquire the right to manage will receive precise location information from their unit, which will enable, for example, a visit to the unit.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the owners of the rights appear on the same map on which the country block information can be found.
The spread fabric sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation Keeper project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land by either buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more countries of protection.
It also aims beyond the borders of Finland and plans to import from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Trade Square August 13-19.
Bike thieves are the worst tormenting cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment the largest cities in Finland.
There are more bikes stolen in relation to the number of inhabitants this year than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the reports to the police, the Helsinki Declarations found out how many bicycles and their parts have been stolen in the 10 largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, there were four out of five bicycle robberies per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle robberies per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double the number of thieves in relation to the number of residents," explains police inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why Turku has been stolen more bikes than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how much the wheels are at all," explains Sergeant Teemu Mähäs.
The police government's Tommi Reen thinks it's quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will be at the top of the comparison.
The amount of bicycle robbery goes largely to study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense center, short distances and a lot of wheels for the thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In January-August, the whole of Finland police record has become slightly less of a bicycle thief than in the corresponding period of last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police have reported a little over 20,000 bicycle robbery every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Mr. Reen calls on people to report theft of bicycles, although fewer than every 10 cases reported to the police are detected.
Typically, theft of a bicycle is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"Conditions can also be found in other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in the context of a police investigation, says older officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle shops, inner courtyards, warehouses and bicycle wheels, i.e. virtually everywhere where they are usually kept.
Of the individual wheel models, Jopää is most stolen as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the wheel for short term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels are sold online, for example.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police don't know that stolen wheels would go a lot abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are usually Finnish.
I'm sure some people will buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some people may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or offence.
"The warning clocks should ring if the good guys are sold at a clear discount," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, always carries a colorful Nops for his working day in Helsinki for the protection of the Kallio Library.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says, "I've never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves, there won't necessarily be any hipster value here," Helsinki's Monster thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to lock his bike with a small U-lock in the Helsinki Kalli kiosk.
Now the bike is tucking the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone paid about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that you've been riding a bike."
"Mostly bad wheels, such rock-hoppers."
One year ago, a bicycle was stolen from the big body of the house company.
Although the bike had not been locked up, Valve was able to wait for it to come by.
Under 15 years of age to be responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, a so - called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
The initial experiment will apply to children under 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
A peer jury is missing the first youngster to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a written letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, Director of the Youth Survey, says that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used alongside each other.
"Everyone steers a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model of the United States of America has been taken into account in its extensive use.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person will not be faced with the adult panel, but will reflect on what happened with approximately the same age.
The model's been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all.
"It's been a message that you continue on the path you've chosen," says Lovio.
The Selection Board is part of the Migration Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stressed that new approaches were offered to all who needed it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published in the US Politico magazine, which had been given a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter has been addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee for Reince Priebus.
Signatories want the party's money to be diverted to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump as well as his lack of attention, his incompetence and his record unfavorability threaten to bring a sound ring to these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate orientation of all possible resources to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-adorned anchor on their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chance to win the presidential elections will decrease by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational characters of the letter is apparently Trumpi's opposing Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to the politicians, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority in Congress" and it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
Furthermore, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working with national security announced in an open letter that they will not support Donald Trumpe as President.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told me about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the American economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the centre of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by the high tax rates, in part by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-on-hand extension for American duneers who have suffered from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We're the builders, we have to go back and build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families in families with children.
On Thursday, though, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax collector, it's gonna have to pay the tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he had previously supported.
"[As President], I oppose all trade agreements that are against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published before Clinton's speech in The Washington Post, Clinton intended to criticize the Republicans Donald Trump's financial programme on Monday for "promising only such millions."
Clinton has previously called Trump's "Trump" loopholes for corporate tax relief.
On Thursday Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur herself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton tickled.
These are Rio's viewers: The races have not joined Finnish fans, but the mobile application is interesting.
The sports competitions are usually seen in television viewer statistics as sharp peaks in the mountains.
The Rio Olympics have not so far reached a peak of viewers.
At one time, the races have joined at their best 12% of the population: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic Channel TV2.
Because of the comparison, almost 800,000 viewers were given TV2 at a time for the one-month Euro-sports event, and the Euro-ball event was worth a fair second million.
For the time being, the Olympic genres have been most interested in cycling on Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, which both reached the Olympic Canal at a time with nearly half a million spectators.
The top sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the audience, and reminds us that the audience will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers in general choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, the viewers also share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has owned for a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London or 2008 Beijing races, but the difference in time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts comes to night time in Finland.
Another reason to be paralyzed is surely the traditional Finnish reason - if someone considered it paralyzed now - for Finland: if Finland had taken a surprise medal for the first round, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, general sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest in Finland: sailing and horse riding.
The initial viewers have been close to expected according to the Pokkine.
When general sport begins, the ratings will explode.
For the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first few days of the races, the Apple App Store became a free-loaded application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd bet we're already gonna get 200 grand in the way.
"The network viewers will only receive us later." Pokkinen tells us.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with a delay and other minor technical problem in the early stages.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
Rio Olympics will be seen in the Upper Channel and the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be tracked from Yle Fem Canal, and on the radio Yle Puhe delivers races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working for Ylle ever, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, there will be Olympic sports on top and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the Day, at a depth of 95.3 metres.
Maybe it's even deeper.
Technical instructor Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters at the Crossrow, the depth of which the diving computer looked 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth in a hundred metres, says developer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvaswater (90 meters).
More than 80 metres extend to Saima, Touswasser and the Main Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Daylight.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the middle depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Day will not be reached among the ten deepest, and Suvaswasser is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12, at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes in the middle were wrong.
Ideas from the Tax Area: Pensioners' tax is still tighter
Pensioners’ taxation is still more intense than wage earners.
The Ihaläinen says that the abuse occurred during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
We believe that it should be.
After the election, the promises made should be complied with, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary reductions were introduced to employees, which reduced taxation.
In the parliament, the matter was heated by opposition representatives who cut off Alexander Stubb, the then finance minister, from the electoral promises.
Buying power is secured, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's messages on the desire to respect the competitive agreement reached at a difficult time.
He says keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the Government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be called into question.
It comes in need, because the economy is so much on the back of domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Involved in long-term unemployment
He appealed to the government to tackle the budget line with regard to long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was approximately 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% will be to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thai attacks
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in the bombings that took place in Finland's time.
The Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Thai Finnish tourists to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thailand travel period is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons at Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be good, says Westphalen.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet on the source of the attacks.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of Thai society and the recent referendum on the military junta constitution.
The law was adopted by referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who reported their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, in turn, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is today a big, local celebration in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
She said the city was celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very accurate about safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, according to AP, the Thai police tell us.
Thailand has died in at least four people during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourists' favourite in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination in Finland, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require the death penalty.
Two bombs exploded according to the paper at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the magazine, one person was wounded.
The popular tourist destination Hua Hin has, in turn, exploded four bombs yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
There was at least one in both of them.
In addition, in southern Thailand, the village of Surat Than and the city of Trang exploded at least one bomb in both.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it transports Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao to the holiday islands.
Not known who committed the attacks
According to the leader of the Thai military junta, Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the author of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic any more, he told the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for security, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Thai Finns to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but caution should be followed by the great-grandfathers, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and the victims that took place during the night of Finland.
Last night's attack at Hua Hin has had a little more time to learn.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded as a sighting near the bell tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where he thinks he's found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower counters according to the governor of the province.
The city worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN chief of police interviewed says that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded approximately half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Balles won the women's square
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second in a score of 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina was third in a score of 58,665.
Partys, 18, are still aiming for yard championships in the Rios with permann, jump and booms.
Partys have been controlling the empowerment of women to the mind for the last few years.
From three previous seasons, he won eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of square and permanno three times in a row, both last year and another year.
On the U.S. team, Bales has won two teams world championships.
The darkest MM medals on the ball have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Ice has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a children's play club based in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think there will be anything more amazing about this, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia, Huovila, who worked for about 20 years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these people haven't been banished by tourists before, I don't think so either.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said you should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movement was allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three days in Thailand time, the traffic in Patong had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men suitable for voice marks hidden in a nearby hexagon.
Another man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the use of the motor vehicle, theft and serious damage.
The police thank you for the clues.
Director of Research on Russia’s Director Changes: Clear Move Out
On Friday, Russia made a high-quality change in leadership over the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned the head of its administration, Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is an Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Perseo.
He's an ex-diplomat. He worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangasburo says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining independent power from the president.
It is also possible, according to Kangasbruka, that Ivanov has been in contact with other managers or that he has failed.
Station drop in Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's inner circle, is transferred to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
With a tape from the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other missions and proposed Persecution to place, said Russia Today.
Kangasburo says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangasburo points out that the old chart, for example the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher Katri Pynnönem from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heirs of Ivanov's place is the fact that Putin changes his neighbor.
Daddy fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so as not to aim for them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manitoba Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jababulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish leaders gained around 90% of Dad’s city of importance.
It is estimated, however, that tens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 7:30 pm: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, and actually the ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Lawlessness of the Ministry of the Interior
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publication of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Vooläinen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voidan says to STT that document disclosure cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister reasoned the decision on the basis of the Government Office's instructions and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounts.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic performance starts in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under the prize contests.
He hurt his way back from the beginning and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic cards.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-weared sambatanzers and fanciers.
Porina Bolt is alluding to the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the age when public sports have struggled with doping scandals and the interest of skating.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the early 200 meters from 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began on a hundred metres, breaking the record of the world and the end of the rivals’ confidence in him at the time of the 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career by the clock of his watch.
World premieres in Berlin at 9.58 on a hundred metres and 19.19 on two centuries are still in force.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 meters and an understatement of 19 seconds, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
The 100th Olympic winner, Justin Gatlin, is one of Bolt's most challenging.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost his finals once, if only he has made his way.
In Daeg in 2011, a hundred MM finals were left from Bolt without running because of a false departure.
Bolt fills in a week and a half after 30.
He's an old man of the young men's kind, and the Rios are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London for the final finish line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the pool, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrate interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes are suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s national news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18, has submitted a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample of Chinese chen xiny.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was passed on to my home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoetins.
He was placed in Rio for the fourth time in a woman's 100-metre butterfly.
The Brazilian newspaper Estadao reports that the Chinese sister has taken her doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport to be referred to the CAS.
Xinhua reports that there are signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide from Xiny on Sunday.
Other doping doubts have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC news that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormones.
Kenya has, in turn, passed from Rio to the home of the general sports coach for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had submitted a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan quick-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-metre racer Ferguson Rotich in a situation.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historic gold became a display style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, swims 200 meters apart in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' profit period was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion second before Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun, the BBC Olympic Commentator Helen Skelton laughs at the Istalehti's quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (about) on Monday is this week's most readable on the website of Ältalaehti.
Next door, commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a small noise in his revealing and special costumes in the paper or in the British newspaper.
Television is a visual media, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-height shoes and short-sleeved dress, with certainly at least sufficient visibility - at least for many conservative British eyes.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and it's just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be disappointed, and maybe he does, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the handle has stretched to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do, is okay for me, Skelton to grind.
You know what?
It is raised from the empty if it comes from wearing (the drinker).
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for terrorist charges.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police arrested them in connection with the security surveillance of the races.
The police did five more arrests in the same connection and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police arrested in July.
The arrested are believed to have links with the ISIS.
The detainees had, of course, incited violence in the social media.
The message of violence had been disseminated, among other things, in the WhatsApp Service’s recommendations.
Eighty-five thousand police are responsible for the safety of the Rio races.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut down the place from the audience.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the explosion of the package.
This was the third time in the Rio Olympics when the police carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The public came in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The audience didn't record the show by the start of the game, because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the other side of the arena.
The police blew up the package and only let the public in control after that.
The drink woke the races up in the Spanish team that had started dreamily.
With two losses, the race started in Spain won Nigeria points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
The police carried out a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.

The Argentine lady in love with Pettäjä-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
The wind at Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Pettäjä-Sire experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady fell in love with the Wind Petäjä-Siren on Thursday at the opening day of the women's surf in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent confessed to the crime.
Because of the accident, he was stuck, and the others escaped, the head coach of Finland, Joakim Wilenius told.
The athlete considered a long time of protest.
It was not worth doing it, because according to the Olympic rules it would have been useless.
I should have dropped into the water so I could get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finnish went on board until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the accident, the Finnish stayed in place of 27.
The overall situation for the 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
There was little impact on the stroke in the relationship.
Friday is an important day when there are races 10-12.
Edited 0.39: By way of first knowledge, the Petährer-Siren did not protest.
7 special issues that according to science extend the age
Science has explored everything possible between earth and heaven.
These matters have been proven to bring additional years to the person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of the person so that his life extends.
On the other hand, things that a person himself cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include, for example, the tendency to have a central body or a social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't even have to do that. You don't have to do that. You just have to go get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to investigate many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strangest findings.
Science suggests that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drink of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The University of Harvard study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low death risk", particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, we are again talking about research that suggests that the reasonable use of one of the three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived as parents than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental treatment can extend the person’s life even for more than six years, a study tells.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infections of the life.
They can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more, were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
Besides everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he or she should also have orgasm.
Of course, sport will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute clumsiness.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with large backs had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these aspects with the mortality of the low sheep.
Whether it's an athlete who won the Olympic medalists or Oscar's winner, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bloke.
A lot of research has tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life more years.
There are some researchers who suspect that a long time is due to a person's social status, which in turn makes it possible, for example, to obtain recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of purchasing behaviour in over 65 years of age found that a person shopping every day, or more likely than a parent purchasing, is more likely to be shopping.
This is because running in specific shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So count your credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
End-of-the-day, run-off-the-wheel drive took off on the truck.
On Friday night, a heavy truck and a passenger car nocturnal occurred in Koskea in Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident occurred at Koskei, the Koskenti and the Sorvastoni in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been heading in the direction of Forssa, when a passenger car had come against the same lane, hitting the truck at the right corner.
After the collision, the truck remained upright, but burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car got trapped in the ditch and then over the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, stayed in her car under pressure.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per thousand.
He's suspected of having a bad drive.
The mail sent looseblows to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk bar range because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to the Wall River.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernie, was buying loose cakes from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the bulk containers because Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when Posti gets the shipment!
So if you don't get in the lawn window, the sign says.
A sign waiting for a merchant is that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawns.
The food is available at Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and she decided to share it in social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the day.
Even the media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Facebook, on Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 splits.
Haltia got her own favorites caught up in loose heart pain, even though a few valleys were empty.
Postin Jaakko Kaideso, Business Manager for Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Overnight Sanom.
The background is that the three of the five stages were misled yesterday in the wrong place (Sinäjoki) and we no longer left to make a sub-delivery (Saloon) at three, but only today we took five stages, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sano.
The first thing I've ever heard about is the Night Words.
Tear Haltia didn't get hurt by the signs, because she found all her own candy favorite in the selection.
Dirty depression! 30 kilos reduced Lotta Backlund published a picture of her transformation
Coke producer's been cleaning up tens of pounds since her baby was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared her pair’s change in Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta had a gym and was looking for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
The cooiko, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his reduction career already in 2009.
He's a complete change in lifestyle, and he's lost a little bit of 30 kilos in silence.
On Friday, Backlund published a pair of photos on Instagram.
The picture shows how enormous Lotta has changed over the years in her appearance.
Before and after backlund, the pair of images has collected many charming comments from fellow artists.
You're great.
We're on the same way, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, while myself on the same journey of skill, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped his final pounds on the project.
At that time he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten kilos.
During the three-month rehabilitation period, five kilos eventually fell.
Wish of a woman murdered in Lovisa: memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of 42-year-old women who were murdered in Loviisa hoped that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the police dog labour.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys donations to police dogs for the wish of the victim's family.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and also performed his nursing training there.
The vet station is reminiscent of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, the 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own courtyard in the Lovisa Kosken village.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cocks.
A man, 27 years old, suspected of murder, didn't know a woman, and they had no connection with each other.
The killer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was wounded in an arrest situation in a life-threatening manner.
However, the vessel survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down Post with a judgment on the infringement of the Equality Act
Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused to practise the temporary agency worker, Kanta-Hämee’s district court judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the majority of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested the intern for salary only a part of the total daily work.
According to the District Court, the worker had been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activity contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Postal and Logistics Union (PAU) decision on the ban on information.
During last year’s November’s postage, PAU made a decision that Post’s employees do not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who breach the strike.
First of all, the People's News told us.
Returning Turkey to the road that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their reply to the Journalism Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter, the Federation of Journalists asked Mr Sipil and Mr Soin to express their concern for Turkish freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini will tell the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech that has repeatedly been brought to Turkey by Finland.
Putin separated his administration from the head of the state of Estonia's Persecutor
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the president's administration chief Sergei Ivanov from the Kremlin, says.
There comes the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vairo.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, reports the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration at the chief.
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will be transferred to the specific tasks of environment and transport according to the Kremlin's newsletter.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other missions and suggested that Persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: Huge acquisition of the ManU against the ban on gambling - see no opening of the Valioliiga
The world record for football transfers is not visible in the field when the English Olympic Games are kicked off during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling was followed by England.
Because of the ban on gambling, Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU when it opened its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, reported the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba an Italian laisseura to Juventus, according to the British media, EUR 105 million.
However, the UK Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, because Pogballe was left to Juventus as a burden of the game ban.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes one match ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next seam play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow's grandeur is a virtue
The precise criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event aimed at world top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The Festaries have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area will be stabilized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have a main stage and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahde in Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to the success is a simple question: What kind of event do the people themselves want to go to?
It's kind of strange in the production of events that we think this way.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come this year to sell out.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 5,000 in the last year.
This year a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is some kind of funding to do.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle flock, which is driven on huge roads.
That's what we don't want.
The ideology of the successful event has been tempered over the past 13 years, with 130 actors, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller presence of slaves, 15 000 tents will be held this year.
Kallio admits that the event could take place more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazy about grandeur, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life alive.
If it loses, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the call is that today's great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, activities were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some €20,000.
Last year, the net sales of the company that run Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can also create "circles of things" like building that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the young, trendy adult community.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as a special fashion.
We want to break up, above all, with the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a red legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rapper, and soul-combining festival with the most typical performers.
According to Kallio, Iggy was beaten because it is probably the last time that Iggy will be seen at the gig in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's been doing fucking good jobs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in the flower pots - tourists fled in horrors
Hua Hin, the local time exploded on Thursday night, two bombs.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the purse and blew up by means of cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
At the same time as tourists started to leave bars and return to their hotels, police representative Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989 a wildlife protector, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to a much-sounding picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can look at it here.
Hua Hin, at least 11 of those injured, were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bartenders, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of persons injured is not yet known.
Soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, also favoring the Finns.
No one's known to be dead.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reported that they had known about Hua Hin at least one bomb that hadn't been able to blow up yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been infested with the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will start fighting in a war situation first
In the event of an acute war, they will only be told after several months that they will swear a military oath, says the Central Finnish.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, the Chief of Defence Officer, interviewed in the paper, for example, about 5.5 months in military service, only those who are in the final stages of their training.
According to the Chief of Education, reserve personnel in the emergency forces are first assigned to the service.
No shipowner or reserve shall be ordered to perform a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training the shipowns in immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during the training of shipowners.
Pamela Tola got a huge reward from the house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price for a separate two-storey building was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in December 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the courthouse and in the courthouse.
The court passed a judgment on the matter on Wednesday.
It was valid for a judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for legal and investigative expenses incurred by the couple.
The right to a reasonable reduction in the price was a little, because some of the house repair needs had already been known to buyers at the time of the dwelling sale.
However, according to court, manifest construction errors were substantially more serious than had been mentioned.
Tola was looking for a good people's home.
In the courtable court, Tola told us that the couple had specifically sought out the good people’s homes because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had been given the idea that the building had been repaired and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the condition check report were not adversely affected.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation risks and accidents and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma came to the conclusion that rainwater from the rock might need to be controlled slightly within a few years.
The shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed the growth of microbes, which according to the Witnesses were due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the earthquake.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to an inspector's estimate, also enter the interior of the porch.
The mites were found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window counter and the basement wash room.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the apartment prior to the sale.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although proper permits were not yet available.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to court, the purchasers were able to assume from the seller that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that the court had no particular reason to carry out more extensive checks.
The purchasers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court finds in its judgment.
Horrifying archive discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also in the register Finnish
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article "Dagens Nyheter" how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, has recorded documents for microfilms, involving a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women as well as 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi bridesms.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German breed office.
The Agency acted under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynaecological studies were conducted in women.
The Bureau of Race examined the backgrounds of women, including the examination of church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's tree.
The women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give the agency the handwritten life and good recommendations from the close.
The Bureau of Race wanted assurances that women were "children's loved ones", "sons" and "good national socialists" who were well-informed in German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bridesmaid of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women from the archives.
The SS directors created a state-supported program known as Lebenborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside marriage.
The Lebenborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are told.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the access of children.
The honorable wife of a German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the "aryans" and the "non-aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages stated.
The sixth of the traitor Sir, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in the first round of the Finnjollian day in the Rio Olympics, but remained in the second round of the day.
In the overall situation, Nirkko rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in place.
The Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for the RS:X class day's departures with seats 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day at 23.
In the overall situation the Lindgrens are located 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulin was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so on canvas"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender bartender in 1995 to tangotunka, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää is still in the process of pruning, and she is currently in a wild lift.
Mari Koppinen, a book about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells of his life and career in good as well as in evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total upswing when he won even the crown of the tango in the Wall River in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang a few songs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuuppamäki had composed a tango piece for the man at the request of Kassu Halone.
Satulinna became one of Finland’s most popular pieces of music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so on the canvas!
It's a book that reminds you of.
As for the recording of the song rising up into the world, it would not immediately be expected that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand the perfect and the highest of itself.
Another accident related to the most popular songs in the book occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää resigned from his partner then and finally ended up with the text of the gold piece, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Türmäs were not exactly what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Onllanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the difference were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7 - day news.
The magazine’s news for the distinction between Jar and the ex-love reported too much celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was a full doll and it wasn’t true.
Jari, according to the book, called in his rage to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the voter polls predict the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university has made a difference, although a few individual researchers may have disagreed with the power of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign "It's the Economy, Stupid" by former President Bill Clinton flew into the British Brexit poll.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic giraffe language
The Centre for Macroeconomics is responding to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey of the profession.
The typical answer is that the finances were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economic explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, i.e. almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many also have the idea that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the ESC, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were criticized for the level playing field in the BBC, which gave just as much space as a couple of percent of the EU's economists representing the economy.
The EU's hostile press was not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letters on the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were not passed on because the economists represent an elite with whom voters do not have common interests.
While academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, in small cities and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will contaminate your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't there?
Every school has children, including immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the right British have to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their answers were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, Britain has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund set aside for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments correspond to the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The victory of the camp in B, which is in favour of the EU difference, began to be more carefully anticipated a few weeks before the vote, in the event that the result would be a blow.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We're going to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or cash, Vanhanen says Aberdeen's only open daily noteable of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to the elderly, the standard level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the money was GBP 3.5 billion at that time.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Olden says about all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was below or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore set aside for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the EU-led camp won, Europe went mixed up.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
These people, together, took the situation and put it in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with the years 2007 and 2008, Old One says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund after it had to close its door.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash collected, but it was ultimately forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the elder, they did not really close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were allowed time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it cancelled the notice.
After that, it was quite even, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He pointed out that, for example, there had been no similar turmoil in the Aberdeen Manner-Europ funds.
However, there was a lot of questions.
Inadequate attention to real estate funds
In the opinion of the elderly, the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
Open funds for closures account for about 4% of British properties.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its fund for the year 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been cut downwards, but the situation does not look 'wonderier' from the point of view of Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, says Vanhanen.
The price of the dollar and the dollar are lowest for 30 years, and the market also has a 15% discount compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of nice buyers, Old One says.
Brexit brought down losses on the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem like much of a lot of things.
But four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, re-emerged to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Oh, my God, that's where you got your head.
I realized this is going for Plan B now, Vanhanen says in another home in Helsinki.
He was heading for work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
The usual silent TV screens at the office were the news, and usually the loud people were silently listening when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display ends flashed from just red.
It was the kind of morning that would never have believed he was alive," says the old man.
Not because, despite the storm, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate shops on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and that is why the situation was in a way peaceful, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started with the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta broke up, the British leadership switched.
The market was starting to anticipate sharp bills for the UK and, in particular, for the London real estate market.
London offices were expected to reduce by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the thunderstorm is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer vacations this week in Helsinki.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already received the first information.
The data of CBRE on price developments in the real estate service sector cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings in London City, the decrease amounted to 6.1 per cent.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Olden.
All similar falls occurred in 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the Lehman crash and the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not entirely satisfactory, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's a different mood.
The real estate market has now seen, not panic sales like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You'll find the funding in the usual way.
The repair operation could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing business is not a miracle of him. That could have been the case without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world's first cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that the city, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started really high.
London prices have been tightening up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership to globalize, the Old One says.
New players have come to the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for investment sites abroad.
London is known as a city as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed a low level of interest rates, which have led, for example, to pension companies seeking returns from new destinations.
On this, the loan has been readily available - although according to the elder, the debt-back has now been used much less than in the pre-crisis period of 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, prices went up smoothly last summer, says Olden.
Aberdeen also began to ease its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy evolves, says Vanhanen.
A lot of him is not afraid to judge the future, but he says that there's hardly any ups and downs.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or a steady trend ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes that the pit will be cleared at work.
If you've been well prepared for the risks, you'll be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in a single market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's been distributed, the risks are also distributed, Vanhanen says.
S-group starts registering purchase information more precisely than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, because the trading group today told us that it is starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
As information on the final amount of the voucher has been collected so far, the group will begin to catch up on products also purchased at the beginning of May.
This is where the S-Group comes after Kesko, as the data on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most efficient channel is email.
A few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to respond to the change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko is already classifying its stock customers according to the only food purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stockholders are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used.
The information is used for the customer’s targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchasing information is only collected from K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer support program and does not have such a program in place.
Finland's Lähikajoki has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer base program, which can be integrated into the selection houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect data on product or product group levels, we will remain at the level of the final sum of the voucher.
So we know where the shopping was done in the store and on the day I and the customer's bill for the final sum.
We have not gone to the level of K-group or S-group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the client programme is to be renewed in the future, but the Middle East will tell us later.
However, Ora does not allow for product data to be entered.
Initial experiment
So far, SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data have included the profession, education, housing, children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S-Bed card purchase has been registered with the date and time of purchase, place, final purchase amount and payment method.
In addition, S-bonus partners’ data have been obtained from their cash systems.
From May onwards, product-level purchasing information will start to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data in S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains are recorded at product group level for the time being.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be more targeted," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Business at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored at the cashier in any case, wanted it or not.
Please check the stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers cannot be accessed, stresses the Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The baby from Black Labradorinnutter is embroidered by five similar boxes set in a row at Helsinki Airport.
Not long after it firmly sits next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with her favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila there was a bottled glass - gas casings.
Ruth’s gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online access
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion away to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks have led to measures at Customs and, after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says the Director-General of Customs Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the training of weapons and explosives to Customs is postal shipments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of an increase in internet traffic, up to 40 million postal shipments per year transit through the airport, which may include weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years Customs has made the discovery of around 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives related to online shopping, baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and post office items.
In future, there will be a great benefit for ports when they can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether further arms and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to the idea.
School with Church Number
Heila-pennu education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonumm.
Suntio also attends police and defence experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and defence forces in the field of explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smell Heila is taught to identify.
The team will always be trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi of Customs.
Labrador explorer Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The choice criteria for a dog to be selected at the airport include repelling and hunting, as well as calmness, as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntion, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila getting home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from time to time.
Evening-Sanomia's cameraman will lose the mik cover for a fast dog, but Heila will immediately return the cover that looks like a soft toy from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for dogs in the workplace
Heila's gonna graduate next year.
There are still high-level tests to be carried out in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can see work at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come and iron the dog on top, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active part time lasts only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition at Tull.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs.
Happiness was found at Suntion, who had not previously had a dog at work, but he has years of experience in dogs as well as in monitoring duties at Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off
At the rugby Olympics of less than a million people in Fiji, it is so highly appreciated that the government has decided to spend August 22nd as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the victory.
The day of the holiday will be held at the team's return home the next day.
The hero team also has celebrations in its home country.
Fidž rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was followed by a final in Suva, the capital, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, I heard their encouragement, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish player fainted after the wild performance
With his last attempt, he succeeded 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening character as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the wrists, he has passed many times.
No one really has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola got 175 kilos of work and a stroke of 145 kilos.
His combined result was 200 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his push, as well as one another, 175 kilos.
In the third company, the weights rose as a result of the horrific rage.
The body shook under the weights until the jury accepted the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired an official guest from Prosa, a salesman's league, an evening chatter.
The men’s football league Rovaniemi Palloseura has concluded a permanent contract with Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team, who has a lot of work to do and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over ten players.
A small group began to be distinguished as a good alternative to Prosa, coach of RoPS Juha Malinen told the press.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from the record-breaking Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
The Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the master SJK of Finland.
The RoPS needed a new attacker, as last year's reignant Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatened by the modern family star, the shorts of the teen star reveal almost everything
As a modern family comedy series, please Alex Dunphyna, who became familiar with Ariel Winter, re-enacts by introducing the threat to his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to be imagined.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also the back of this.
Most recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making its style and use considerably more courageous.
The star has put on social media pictures in very low clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also seen her dress in very scarce costumes.
Recently, winter, which is on the verge of an adult, has also published a number of photos of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
The founder and CEO of PowerWomenTV, Amy Palmer, doubted that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it seems to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention is given in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed part of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
No matter what the others say.
You're inspirational to many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer to visit Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by the boom: In the autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start up the survey trips from the beginning, says Visit Finland in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main targets of Japanese revenu tourism.
Our winter travel boards are strongly linked to the heart winter and the snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a lot of demand for windmills, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that early autumn is beginning and going on far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the upwinds of making a vision two-fold at random, says the press release Visit Finland's CEO Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland's survey campaign are wealthy women aged 25-35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already fully interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University, researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear unique sights in Finland, and Lind says this is a huge potential.
The number of nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly from other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much time in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group because they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for the silver rugby 7-game when the Fidz champion team won gold
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the seven rugby games broke down sharply when Fidzi won it in the finals played at the Rion Deodoro Stadium on Thursday 43-7.
Fidzi gave master training in ball handling, transfers, side injuries, support games, running lines and rough, and thus won gold — if there was the first Olympic medal in all its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little bit more of a comfort to Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the Olympic Games for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
On the same day, the heavy winnings from the South African Bokse in the 7–5 semifinals could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British, even though the 15-person team would have been in full power.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former British rugby 7 coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been considerable for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in Ryan's training at Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is staggering.
Fidzi started excellently and presented his tactile skills to the UK as for fun.
It seemed that Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had encountered moving buses, and the world champions rose to 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau plunged into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored a second goal on the right of the goal.
Situations 12 to 0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent tack prevented sane Leone from making a third goal, but it did not delay Fiji’s progress for long.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made the goal at the right angle, after which the United Kingdom had 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made the second goal of the continuation, with the first half-time playing time remaining for more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravuvou crashed through the British team's ever more powerful punches and crossed the finish line.
After the paint job, the opening period ended at 29–0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven rugby players, while the British are still in the role of the disciple.
Whatever's keeping it a lot of place.
In half-time, Great Britain made large-scale changes and managed to hold on to the Fidzians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova scored thanks to the fidzians’ excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36 to 7 by making the UK paint to the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fidz’s pure joy.
Mata Viliame finished with the fidzian cake by making a goal in the last moments.
Pilli, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan's semifinals in the 20th to 5th centuries, and Great Britain had sluggished past South Africa in a tight semifinal, where the situation solved the British goal.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boks to the lead in the first half of the year, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his blazing footwork and fell under the goals in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, a 15-player rugby player in England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glober and Heather Stanning to row gold
I don't think gold could be more sensitive to this in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning scored 220 winning bet in history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Although in the air they were the two, in the boat the third coach heard Robin Williams’ voice, which encouraged them to another successive Olympic gold in the women’s doubles. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports that reach a similar achievement.
Their supremacy was uncontested, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two great athletes joining the surface of the water as the swans of age, is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to twinning towards achievement. However, the most important of the helpers is the coach, who 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and who then did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation at the time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's changing a little way of thinking."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if this is the case in circumstances such as this.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward six, nine and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it starts.
The noise itself is already on the way, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent the nervous morning and talked a little more about normal in trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning, who was behind the Afghan tour, of the British Royal Artistry, says: "I've had the ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen and Robin's safe have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, so I can't believe he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person with whom to train, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition for the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the twins in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very attached in the moment.
Helen said "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get out of the way."
"We managed to go well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't want the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good fit and win the race we did."
He'll think about it a year before he decides on his future.
Glover celebrates next month with Steve Backshall, familiar with television nature programs
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took me about six months to realize I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to understand.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to replace the government of Panama beds
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which have already been demanded by protesters in the spring, who have been raged by Panamanian information leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold the new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the final rage of the people will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the powers was clearly expressed, and Mr Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected as President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama Daddy was the founder
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his most recent speeches.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the seated President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton also involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone down like that go to the Chief of the Army, Clinton.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-popular cannula on the swimming beaches, including the British magazine Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a respectable swimsuit.
The decision also states that bathing facilities, which largely express religious connections, may increase the risk of disturbances of order in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to the celebrated French national day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Daddy attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the Oulun bathing waters passed through the sieve - Lake Veykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the Lake Badge has been observed on the lake’s beach.
During the Tuesday and the mid-week, the Oulu region's environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches.
Apart from the shores of the sea, concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the limits set by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Marine bathing water E.coli and enterococcal concentrations were confirmed on Wednesday, at which time bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue vegetation observed on the lake shore of the lake is not yet ineligible for swimming in water, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly become a blue-green-salted flower, making the surface of the water as blue-green-salted ponds.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more intensive inspections.
In the event of a conversion of the blue-winged assembly into a blue-winged group, the notification table for the bathing area shall also be provided.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
TMK’s Hakkaraine Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside the forest
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's next year's draft budget.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance's presentation of a forest gift reduction has four objectives: promoting the generational change of forest premises, raising the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest holdings and increasing the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the net income from the forestry sector.
Overall, it is a good idea to make such a tool to promote the generational change of forest spaces, commenting on the forest manager Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the hackraine finds criticism in the tax reform proposal.
The forest gift reduction is to be provided for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
This is the amount of capital that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the view of MTK and Hackraise, the impact of the tax reduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the proceeds of the sale of the timber.
The VM’s proposal is based on the fact that a reduction in the pure capital income of the forestry industry is prevented from resulting in a loss of the capital income of the forestry industry, which should be deducted under other taxes.
Such a person would have a tax advantage, even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners, according to him.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high by the hackers.
According to him, 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are cut off from the cutting circles.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, forest gifts have been exported to Hakkaraise for decades.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful rage surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars got caught up and ran into each other.
There was a special after-haul on the fish at Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue plant, two consecutively driven cars were derailed into the ditch, after which a collision occurred earlier.
According to Harri, the fire master of the day friend, he was asked to defy his ore due to the heavy force of force.
In the back of the car there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more detailed information about their injuries.
Until now, the driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 Himangala a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at Turku University can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of academic professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumour increases the cancer's malignantness.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was able to prevent laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the studies were published on 4 August in the popular Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The fall of the moustache's family home is continuing in court, the prosecution also requires a murder sentence for another perpetrator.
The fall of the Muhu family home is continuing in court for both of the convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for a family home in Muhokse.
One of them received eight years of four, including a young person’s murder and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for a young person who has committed murder and a brutal robbery.
The convicted person also received a judgment on the serious threat to road safety as a young person and on the right to transport as a young person.
The District Court judge complained of the prosecution, the lawyers, and the man who was given the toughest sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser sentence for a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison as a young person.
Were at the time of the act in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as the director of the Child Welfare Unit at the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old man who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the couch in the living room, according to the reasons.
The director had gotten away from him and moved the young man into his room, where one of the young man hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind study, both of those convicted were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to flee family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing only at 156 years of age
For the longest living vertebrate in the world, ice cream has been confirmed, says a study published in Science.
In the North of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark floating around Greenland, the Holker can live for up to 400 years.
She's only growing up when she's 156.
The fact that it only grows in centimetres a year is added to the life of the ice shark.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than any other species.
The scientists discovered the age on a radio-carbon drive.
Some sharks had radioactive residues due to nuclear tests in the 1950s.
Based on these, the scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years - although a throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wise man - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if Donald Trump’s corporate tax change was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without a collection, there would be a huge amount of money, a thousand billion dollars a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount of 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be revised and the energy sector rules must be abolished.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is one of the major causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be suspended.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 % tax and a 35 % penalty tax on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalisation, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch at sea, American steel will lift new cloudlights all over the country.
By contrast, Trump read faithfully through the speech written by assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early Friday in Finland.
Attack Wave from the Past - People's News
The sea is fatally raging, but the actual wave of attack is striking in the middle of Madrid's street - the account with the past can begin.
It summarizes Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
The previous steering work by Almodovar Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a satirical comedy, the previous Skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the Spanish career.
As a rule, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a love, human and family drama of the contemporaneous seagulls, with a mother-daughter relationship at the centre.
The story is a chimp, and we see it as a long back.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be a miracle at the end of the film until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Juliet once took the steps of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, a well-known TV show between Ommelten (2013-2014), will be on the rise.
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered as a kitchen, but I would say to myself that time is cleverly and verbally with a single bath.
For Almodóvar films often with such distinctive scorching, including humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is a steady-played, held-in, place with good music and quite sad film, where such is the material for the elegance.
On the other hand, a typical visual color alertness for the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to inject a small silence into the eye as a more clean form than a functioning dramatizing mode of action.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to the suit: in the case of a person named, the accommodation varies from one scene to another, and the same applies to the places shown.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, the impressions of the previous scene, do not improve more.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Nobel Prize-winning Canadian Alice Munro in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Karkulainen: Relatungen.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equal written filming of literature.
Alexia would have had an emotionally incomparably tougher drama, and that's the big deal - especially the mesmerizing guilt - of the film's thematics.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novelties by Alice Munro.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - News of the nation
No new cuts will be made, by powerful ministers, so that the basic Finns will not collapse altogether.
However, cuts decided in the spring will be made at a drop shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The savings of four billion already decided will be sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (coc.) convince under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the presentation of the VM, because the cuts in social security were already decided upon in the spring framework.
Child benefits, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but the kennels are haunting you.
Why do the ministers stress so thornyly that there are no further cuts on them?
Because next year's election year.
The county councils are held in April and they are the most important meters of fever in the parliamentary term, not gallops.
In the past, it has been seen that the result of the rule of law that takes place in the different directions of government has been ruining the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the government party for the basic Finns is expecting a smoke-absorbing coup, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
The basic Finns received 752 new representatives four years ago, of which a large part will be realized next spring by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three about as large parties' governments is to be expected to last for the basic Finnish people's lives.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted in the party got enough for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visiting status have also come to an end.
First, the fact that next year they will be made brutal and, secondly, the attempt to soften the waiting attack on the basic Finns will not be obscured by the rhetoric of new surgery.
Major cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the target for indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take on EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the local authorities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other one's holding onto the show.
This means even more severe cuts to the 2017 budget line on top of the former ones.
The budget would strike at least a close balance in 2018 and then, in the spring, the parliamentary elections will take up what is coming.
The debt does not seem to be the case with these measures.
It is quite clear that the current debt-to-GDP measures are not working, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to create a positive atmosphere.
The visits made by the Secretary of State, Mr Martti Hetemä, in the knowledge of the Budget, are unrecital to this effect:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no call for international economic assistance.
Finland’s economy has not just risen since the collapse of 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy implemented at the beginning of the 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35 per cent and increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now pays more than EUR 3 billion a year than in 2008.
At the recently presented curves, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief of the left wing association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the sense of responsibility of the city center, the assembly company and the basic Finns.
Question: There is a desire to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four think that child day care, youth work and exercise are the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research carried out by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population is also depriving the individual municipalities of responsibility for libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, secondary education and waste management.
For their part, the province's responsibility is more clearly expressed in the form of a provincial plan, special health care, vocational training, universities of higher education and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the tasks of the local authorities are to be transferred to the State.
Underage runner ran after a drive to the end of the police escape.
Joensuuläinen 16-year-old motorcyclist ran away from the police patrol in Joensuu in Joensuu on Friday night for half a time.
The police party tried to stop a motorcycle driven without light, but the young man left to run away from the police with a fair speed.
The back drive continued to Sonkajanrannant, from which continued to Sorronahont and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after that, the young man went running away, but a faster-footed cop ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per thousand.
Nor did he have a driver's license that would have allowed driving a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock fell into its axe
The truck in the rock shed fell to the ditch on the lake Polvijärvi in Kaavinti at 9:15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curving bend out of the road and fell on its side.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first-hand workers.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From the fallen truck, hydraulic oil spilled into the road. The rescue plant was sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in the Airfield
Since the afternoon, 87-year-old woman has been on the street in the Lahden village of Ilmajoki in the South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman with a white jaw under her hair, about six inches [ 165 cm] long, thin, and grumpy.
Observations and hints on missing movements are requested to call the Situation Centre of the North-West Region's tip number 0295440513.
The material of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The crash of the tent of the Parafest festivals caused considerable damage.
The president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will reach its feet economically, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performance of the Parafest was at the end of Friday night at Kale Salon.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations held at the city theatre, starting at 1 p.m.
Art Center Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program will be organized as planned.
The causation flow is generated in the thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling air flow.
The changes in the water condition of the udder bind heat and therefore the falling air will cool and its speed towards the ground will accelerate.
The Institute of Intelligence reports that the flow rates occur in Finland during several summers.
It's hard to predict the path of the crash currents.
The crash flow struck the location of the Parafest in Joensuu Art Museum’s backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to an end, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Accidentally, four people hurt themselves lightly.
Among them was one child who was transported in mild injury to further treatment.
Air pollution and ageing of the Londoners
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
Evening Standard tells of British research.
Caci, a British skin care company, analyses London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly couple living in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
In Cac’s study it was found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who are walking on their way to work in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution by, for example, different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed the man standing in front of you
He had moved stones in his yard circle on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall short of it, but the tractor, however, had to be carried to the central hospital for further serious injury.
The tractor didn't get any longer, because it hit the rocks in front of it.
Draining for the coming season with the most powerful
The riverside league playing in the Airball League is starting from a series of better starting points than the men's memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone is certainly better than the previous seasons when the series began to be dark in Rienno.
Jani Säis, who continues as the main coach of the line, praises the new team for their commitment and unity.
In Rienno, Fred Musoni starts his second season in the middle fight of the three foreigners.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared on the Rwandan national team, is a 205-inch hunter.
Garchet is similarly suitable, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimetres.
Through Jozban, Katajan and the Joki boys to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing almost all the Hallbandy MM games since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, but only in 2013 was better off in the North American race.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen moved to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the species was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
That's what they played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokiboys hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university's salibandy SM series in 1991-92, the following three throughs spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, she trained the A-girls in the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
All in all Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, the balance amounted to 169 in the match 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were named to the national team
Josban, a Joensuu salibandyseuran, raised Perttu Puska and the English-led Tatu Väänen were elected to the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old who attacks in Helsinki, has played this before six men's championships, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänen, has retired from the travel team and is part of the country team’s standard equipment with 117 terrains experience.
The country team was also named ‘Maika Kohonen’, the concert player of the Seinäjoki game brothers, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last time at the World Cup last December.
The main coach of the Salibandy team is Petri Kettunen from the Gulf of Conti.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - baby SM is missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is stopping as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current period.
Beach full of Finnish championships will be settled in Kouvola Sports Park during the weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in adult and young groups.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airballists and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament is awarded to the six best pairs of each series.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's educator Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is eager to wait for games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will be able to take a look at you this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesi Stadium.
I haven't played in adults in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu's atmosphere.
The Kouvola region lit up the spark of Hasu and gave good lunches for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories about childhood.
I started a balloon when I was 9 in the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main one is in mind too large a shirt, in the ankles round knee covers as well as huge ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small community there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the team mate trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural species selection in junior times in contrast to the ball.
The track has been played on the shores of the lake since the 1990s.
It's always been active on trips.
I also went to the junior SM contests myself, thinking that some day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Pieksäkelän Anniina Parkkise in the SM finals.
Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahde have a clear goal for a second hard-hitted double in the tournament.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We don't even have a prize cap on the SM- baby, Hasu throws it in a mysterious way.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last known audience to Hasu.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
I'm sure the international career will be over after the Kisakalli tournament.
Otherwise the toes are put in the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Pass flow dropped tents at the disabled event in Joensuu, the major accident was near
The crash flow dropped three tents at the Parafest Festival for the disabled in Joensuu.

According to the cattle, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the largest tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
The fire master Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by the Karelian newspaper, tells the newspaper that there was material to a major accident.
According to the paper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an enterprise means risk reduction, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Soon, two years ago, Koli and his little brother, Valtteri Kol, began to operate as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the holding so that bread could come into the hands of agriculture.
This has been my little boy ever since.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard house, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself really courageously joined the project and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli tells and adds that if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is going to be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who is raising meat cars, is to invest even more in a bigger hub.
The work has produced a result, for Solomon’s Koli has been elected to the top ten in the competition of the young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be put to the vote on the magazine's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (after June 2012) and the first time that it rises to more than zero after last October, when the country reported a 0.2% positive inflation.
The average annual inflation of the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. 1.0% of the monthly inflation rate.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 as a percentage of December 2015 to December 2015), the rate of inflation has been –0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was –0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, the prices of the following consumer goods groups increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), recreation and culture (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), other goods and services (0.3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1 %).
Prices for the following product groups remained on level with the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Anime efficacy of Snapchat is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter has been inspired by an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, some 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity ways that bring absurdity closer.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unadorned, features distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie a day.
All the illusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have been criticized for recommending blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty pendant.
So when it offered some of its users a filter this week that turned their eyes into brows, wrong teeth and made cheeks, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The reviewers also wondered whether these repeated contradictions indicate a greater problem with the company’s diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, including online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told them he had removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was intended as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly contested the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets of images were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the very tasteless Asian cactus to compare the filter's efficiency.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface" but a demeaning extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it seems that there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, always from the governments of companies to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents’ counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more subtlety.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, this kind of thing will no longer be very easy to notice, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
As a product manager and designer, Zhu, who works on the Medium publishing platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview in the medium, he said that he believed that conflicts in ethnicity reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company for being the majority of the white and only male leaders, and decided to write with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that their one-sided staff don't have colored people, so they can make decisions like this, or then they also have colored employees, but their position is not such as to dare tell their opinion straight and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff as a private enterprise.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to its informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter, whose purpose is to focus on under-represented groups of people and promote participation within the company.
For their part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to Congressional expert group, military officials distorted intelligence information about Daddys
On Thursday, the Congress Group published a report that states that US Armed Forces officials, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of war against Daddy in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave rise to an understanding.
The Republican Chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Enquiry and Defence Appropriations set up a task force to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of the intelligence analysts of the armed forces.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampassa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the top leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the United States' anti-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed, and were exceptionally more positive than those in the analyses of the other units of the intelligence community," reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events cannot be accepted – our soldiers are suffering when a high level of political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says California Republican representative Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's senior management's mistakes go to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of 2014 and 2015 that Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama’s administrative authorities would have been forged, it gives an analytical picture of the perception that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Daddy.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's statements on press releases, statements and congresses were much more positive than what happened in reality," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official made a public statement that a major military attack to regain Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Daddys.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo in the press.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top U.S. Armed Forces intelligence leaders manipulated the results of the investigation in order to mitigate the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans, after learning of the doubts raised by analysts about the manipulation of the intelligence of the Fathers, formed a working group.
The report published on Thursday will follow up on more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, an investigation into Centcom's intelligence has been initiated by the Department of Defence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the Committee for the Enquiry of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"between the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process which was too limited to assess intelligence information on the Daddys and Iraq security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, High Representative for the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "decelerated the publication of the intelligence results, violated the morals of analysts and "considered insufficiently different views".
According to the ship and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to "pre-ordered or political official line".
Daily Beast announced on Tuesday the preliminary results of a study by Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon's inspectorate, which began as a result of the complaints made by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon's reporter, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, in his press release, says that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspector's investigation is ongoing.
He says, however, that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation also has further follow-up to the attempt to find out whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (including the argument made by several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year have cast doubt on how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and on its honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of father intelligence corresponds to the disagreements of more than a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which the government of President George W. Bush, despite objections from many analysts, supported only small troops to Iraq and spent a little time thinking about what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the Issian intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the protests against the Isis-controlled processors had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary processing plants and was thus able to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported in The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had assessed the statements of the Senate witnesses as overly positive on the war.
General Austin retired in April, and General Joseph L. Votel was replaced by Central Command Commander.
The United States wins the fourth round in women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the inter-declaration with Britain
After three goals in the winning game, scored 6-1 against Japan, Katie Bam made the U.S. women’s ground hockey team for the first two goals on Thursday, when the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had ever succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who like to count on paint."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost zero games and are sharing their team with the British first place, who continued to win their winning line on Thursday in the Japans 2 to 0.
The UK and the United States compete on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the second.
The first to avoid a longer time of encounter with the Dutch team who won the second block.
Despite what happens on Saturday, the Americans have already raised their noise about their surprising success in these races, four years after it was the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first seized his ground hockey team when he was only 3 years old (she had two older sisters playing in Drexel).He got to the ground team at 16 and was thus the youngest ground team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not make it to the final list of players.
After that came the 2012 races, where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham, the Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our pacers in London weren't like it's now.
We have made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goaltender in the first half of the day, hitting the ball near the bustle.
India had entered the game without any tournament win, but it proved surprisingly hard to resist and kept the situation between 1 and 0 until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, swung to the middle field, hit the ball and led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first of the tournament where the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal blank. In the first three games the American goals had ended up with one hit each.
Briggs is now alive in his successful season.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympiahulina Trampoline Brings Zen
Whatever the location and the time, the Olympic Games are bound to run into the Olympic Games.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem like the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
It's like the Olympics itself would be a flashing catch, moving from the bow to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnast and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't open TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation on the coffee line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first Olympic Dooley charmed with her smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and be part of the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good mind on TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a sword-blower.
But Dooley, 28, from California Lake Forest, competes for Olympic gold with a trampoline.
The Olympic Games do not illuminate all competitions on an equal basis.
Far away from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports, such as aerial gunfire, archery, slugball and taekwondo.
We will always have a breastbath, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I am allowed to write a modest story about my own special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained attraction of trampoline.
Although Trampoline has been an Olympic type since the 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic type.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has indeed participated in the Olympic Trampolin, but the country has never reached the medals or progressed to the finals until 2012.
In men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the side of women's medals, the Canadians are shattered.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLenna are defending gold medals this year that they won in London.
However, there is the charm of the low-lying artist in Trampoliin, which, in part, because of the in civilized place it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I believe that I am not an expert, but only a regular fan.)
The species has a composition of its potential used in drawing films for endless bombardments of figures, but it also has the same value as amplification and swimming jumping, i.e. species that are essentially connected in the trampoline.
The word trampolin comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "swimming board".
The honorable champions jump on a huge trampoline, which traps them at a height of almost 10 metres. Before landing, the skiers must make a series of acrobat movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries will compete for the championship of the Trampoline Force, with 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympic species is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, the medal instruments must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the goal line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to secularism or the wall of departure, they also have another goal to which they strive in television reportaments, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and enough even to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this somewhat exhausting only when watching the races.
This trampoline offers a breathing break.
In Trampoline, it's heading upwards.
The aim is not to move forward.
The powerman swings up like an astronaut, drops down, and singes back up in trouble.
Of course, the species also has a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the finish or a long jump, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympic Games can get off.
The women's race and the finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and the men's races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, starting at 2 p.m. local time each day.
In the midst of the Olympics, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be missed in the midst of a public hop.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering men athletes who are appealing to the eye and by objecting to them – as the American men's soldiers recently suggested in the Wall Street Journal – Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fan.
The entire generation protested in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The government's forces have broken down demonstrations that call for political change across Ethiopia by force.
Eye-catchers say that several protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, countries have been shaking anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to more and more wider areas.
Only last week, thousands of people ran into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Eye viewers say the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
It is expected that the demonstrations at the end of last year, or in the videos described at the beginning of this year, will show how the security forces will hit the small young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country together, and to make it more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Director of the International Crisis Task Force on Africa's Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, which has promoted stability in the West.
The US army and intelligence are strongly supporting the Ethiopians in their fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, receive such much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital Addis Ababa is even a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the country of democracy: human rights organisations have consistently reported government repression policies, opposition is very limited and opponents are quickly reduced.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far to the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
"If the people are suppressed, and there is no alternative but to show their mind, it will break out," says Seyoum Tehome, who works as a lecturer at Central Etiopia University.
"The whole youth shows their mind.
The whole generation protested."
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, always from land use to the power of the government coalition.
The ruling party and its allies, largely after the critical elections of last year, received the last seat of the opposition, which means that they are now ruling the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the intensified situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle that took place in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less fallen Separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front, may seek to exploit mixed impotence and weapons.
There are many reasons why the bitter atmosphere that has been hanging over the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is an obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only over the past couple of years have the Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media when cheaper smartphones became commonplace and Internet availability improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people access the Internet through brokers who conceal their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they called people to demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of people in Ethiopia, the troubles and the amhars.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
Most of Ethiopia’s Christian high seasmen have long been in control of the country’s policy and business, and have been looting concerns, many of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is on its way and we are about to get under the same umbrella," says Ormo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have just been in the areas of anxiety and amhara.
Many bitter and troubled people feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the tiger tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet is dominated by the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died by name of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly capable of detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled the opposite.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Mr. Hailemariam Desaleg, stepped into Meles’ boots from an almost unknown moment.
Unlike Meles, who was from the region of Tigren belonging to the northern Etiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tiger tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, thousands expressed their opinion against the elections that, according to analysts, the government first cut and then stole.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although fewer dead than in previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for the far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for the significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But internal grudge against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from increasing.
And the grudge is about to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in Gondar, the Amhara city, the protesters attacked companies owned by the tigers, and the anti-tigre hate speech is on the rise in social media.
The analysts say that the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia for observation aircraft, but according to the U.S., it has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want the collapse of its already unstable allies.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was a sarcastic when he claimed Obama Daddy was the founder
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to draw his words back in the last dispute in his campaign, claiming that he was not serious this week in claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the "founders" of the Isis terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to send a clear message to the citizens of his country.
His supporters will also have to try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he might not have meant.
Trump made a statement at the election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
But early Friday morning Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump was in full swing in the twit from the day before, when I said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio drinker and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpi soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Daddy, the Republican presidential candidate did not agree to withdraw his claim.
The latest criticism storm rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back on the economy as the support figures were calculated.
Trump and Clinton were holding their economic policy line talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended the sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he got a lot of criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
This way Trump will stretch the boundaries of political speech and draw his words back, if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that will respond to his supporters. He looks at how the supporters react to the messages, and then "explain" in a way that depends on other reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are sufficiently circular to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even further in recent days when his support figures have continued to fall.
On Friday, a new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristi revealed that Trump’s support for Clinton is much lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tight.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for excuses for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the last few months, after increasing attention has been paid to his presidential campaign, the jokes of Trump have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, where they will have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolf W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate in CNN's interview on Thursday.
"I consider his statements to be a justified political speech," said Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming Obama and Hillary Clinton founded Daddys.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama wrongly called a "lower-series team" and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed CIS to continue its efforts when it did not deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of defamation and discriminatory attitudes towards him.
He ridiculed "unsatisfactory and pathetic" TV commentators who try to find out about him, but he said that he couldn't succeed in it.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said it only shows more clearly that he is not a president.
The café at Greenpoint opens because of the unfair rent.
Verb Cafe was a bit of a rough coffee shop in Williamsburg, where it was only cash and where there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café had to be priced out of its streetside on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose unreasonably.
Soap Cherie, who came to Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells cupcake soaps.
The locals consider this to be a sad thing to avoid the loss of the middle class coffee shop.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, new ones are being created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is also still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, an old coffee shop's long-term employee.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb holds the balls from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso model.
In addition, it reopened even the old Verbi lamps.
Mr Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new and
added to the list of new products.
Peco-cane egg and cheese sandwiches are available and are filled with capric and browned onion rings.
The list also has dark circles.
No more beer from the coffee shop, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the old standard customers started to walk in Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made walks to Verbi, which was still located in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells me that he's stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," she says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice cream coffee, which is also listed.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, loyally visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I walked into the cafe every day for 15 minutes, like a machine, and there they already made my pancakes with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and added new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still holds his standard product, but occasionally he changes his bakery's bacon, chicken egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says there's no grudge at the fact that the soap shop took the old place.
Soap Cherie’s owners even offered to make a special soap for the production of Verb’s own cold-fried coffee.
"We'll still be able to take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Poland, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a place for it so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-fried coffee in the coffee shop.
The coffee shop may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough that they get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, I felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I had the smell of a coffee shop."
A Square Meal: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his lunch office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary, was fond of the luxurious food of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as goose liver and Maryland's turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: the devil’s eggs (deviled Eggs) in tomato sauce, potato and dessert from the plum.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple at Brooklyn Heights work as both eating historians.
Coen’s latest book, called Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of a storey in the Lower East Side district of the city through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published on Tuesday by Harper, which depicts the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to an appointment with the supplier at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron dusk and was opened the same year as the big stock market collapse occurred in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive oil sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potato and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a debate on eating a very large recession.
"The bulls were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut, liver, and mashed potatoes.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine your cancer so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe's gonna go.
"It must have pushed the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession years, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, served the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for the agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner were served with freshly baked pies.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronic of the ways in which the people survived when there was a sudden loss of consciousness.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for the Americans," Coe says, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the more distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious foods such as fries and potatoes became the main food, and the potatoes were called "a great way to use food sources" because the chefs could cover not so attractive manufacturing ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the main part of American food, became sparingly used luxury.
Strange mixtures were tested, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calories and nutrients and not so much taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
When making a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared pancakes filled with peanuts, which were used as a bottle-time food.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," Coe says,
More about the disease: "It was unrealistic.
Groundnut butter and oven onions are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Domestic experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be carefully budgeted and to respond to the challenge of making carrot-cermaspage-like sweet, tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a festival of historical pastries.
Especially tasty are the reports of the leadership's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "given me to eat cake" attitude.
At the same time as he publicly praised his child’s simple food on the Iowan farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a refined gentleman who had become him.
"He liked a continental kitchen, like a fish and a cucumber sauce," Coe says.
"He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, on top of a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As mentioned in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in any flavor, the dishes served in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst in manufacturing."
Many of the rain-time meals were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intakes and how science has been applied to cooking.
In writing, the couple tells us that they had begun to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," Coe says.
"People even began to get sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once from the windshields."
After the main food plates had been emptied at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought up the bone marrow food they made at home, the same as President Roosevelt ate on lunch.
"It's called a plum wax," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a look-alike name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream wax, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We were reluctant to sink our spoon into a thick brown mound.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe's second time and third time.
"The German nuts would do better than this," Coe tells his wife, sounding like a positive budget holder.
full compensation to Gilead for the legal fees for the patent dispute with Merck on the C-hepatitis medicine
The United States Regional Court Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for its legal dispute with Merck & Co Inc. concerning the patent for hepatitis C.
Gilead was released in June from compensation of $200 million for the infringement of the two Merck-owned patents in connection with the successful medicines of Gilead and Harvoni.
In a complaint filed on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court states that Gilead was entitled to the exemption from legal fees for the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under the laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead medicines.
The U.S.-supported forces have taken control of the city of Manitoba's fathers
The U.S.-supported troops have been taken over by the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, reports the mass media.
Syria's Democratic Forces (SDF) group has now lost the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbi military council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that the 2,000 hostages captured by Daddy's fighters have been released.
"The city is now entirely in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Friday 2015 his tax return showing that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and that the real federal tax rate they paid was $34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book, which covered his term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Virginia's Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton released their ten-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign supporter Jennifer Palmieri in his press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind the excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
In this way, the US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even though the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have relied on the tax authorities to check it and say why Trump hasn't disclosed his income information.
"The transfer is yours" with reference to the tax information of the campaign assistant Ian Sams, who is a candidate for democracy.
On Thursday, Mr Trump's Special Legal Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he will not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the checks are complete.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican President’s candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican authors, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his grants to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and published a video online on Friday, where he brings out visible Republicans who are pattering Trumpi to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on economics in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what each presidential candidate has been doing for decades and not his or her public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a central issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the regulation appointed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multinational company located in the same location, challenged Trump to meet them both to disclose their tax information.
Buffet tells us that he too has been subject to a tax government review and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns up to 2007.
Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York City, paid an average of 32 per cent of the federal tax in 2007-2014 and their actual combined tax paid was approximately 40.5 per cent.
In contrast to most Americans, Clinton's 2015 tax return shows that only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and interest income totalling $109,000.

Chili powder-filled fumes in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania have invented an unusual way of keeping the elephants close to the human race — the elephants are rushed by throwing out the condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The event has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching the volunteers of northern Tanzania villages how residents can protect their homes and crops without damaging the elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used for the alarm of the elephants.
Friday is the world's Norway Day dedicated to animal protection.
"We have seen the change of attitudes in these villages following the development of the method, as the villagers can now trust that they will be able to keep the elephants out of their fields," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, in their press release.
First, the intruding elephant is disturbed by pointing a flashlight and playing a peat.
If this doesn't work, then throw the so-called chilipilvi.
The chili powder mixed shall be placed in a condom in combination with a sulfide, and then the head of the condom shall be turned around in such a way that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually, one spiced clove is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way to do this is to shoot the fireworks known as the Roman candle into the air and create a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticises Berlin’s hotel for removing Israel’s direction number from the Arab “power” – RT News
The French film director, who was a Jew, gave birth to the media rag after he revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention the Israeli direction number in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, broke his frustration with Berlin's Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of directions offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it had not existed?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the response of the reception officer that shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempienski hotels".
The reason behind the action further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli direction number."
The interview by the Suddeutsche Zeitung by Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Tradesman called the case "a great shame".
"The killing will stifle and shock us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more disgraceful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and it is this very hotel chain.
That's all there is to be explained.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," says Ambassador.
The case caused quite a reaction online, where it was called scandalous.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Afty" was said in a publication that brought out the hotel location near the synagogue Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel's protesting charges quickly, calling for a mistake, and asking for an apology from Lanzmann.
"There was never a great order to leave Israel out of the list of directions," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, saying the representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the direction number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in Brazilian students' demonstration
Students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to express their views on government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators.
The riot began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student force, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their impoverishment to government plans participated in the demonstration.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo has made a proposal for a savings measure to close almost 100 public schools and invest 300 000 students in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffitis on walls that temporarily opposed the president’s office of Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the street was filled with the distinguished President, Dilma Rousseffi, of the protesters in favour of the country's Senate in the vote on the charge of this.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 % – RT Business
After the withdrawal of the embargo, an annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya, Iran.
According to him, interest in the business of Russian companies in Iran has increased since the repeal of international sanctions against Iran.
"The Russian companies will continue their existing relations with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further trade growth is one of the priority objectives of cooperation between countries", says Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
The sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons accelerated trade," says Ambassador.
Dzhagary also expects the record number of Iranian castles to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, Russia's Foreign Office in Iran granted about 35 000 visas to Iran's citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the 20 first countries on which citizens travelled in Russia.
And it is not too dare to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is breaking this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists to Iran in turn is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner scored a goal for the British when winning cycling gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner competed in the famous men’s team print at Rio’s Velodrome last night when the British triangle defended the championship earned in London in 2012.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner was the anchor’s role, which he inherited from the countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud when he praised the goal and took the victory from the team of New Zealand, who was considered to be a favorite.
Britain won the surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only finished sixth in the March London MM race, despite the fact that Hoy had subsequently left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of the first player.
Hindes just came out at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom British coaches believed and in whom they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and the championship four years ago won by Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record at the time, but the first round of New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in dubbing.
Hindes was right behind him after his round, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead position that Skinner maintained.
Much of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down at a higher speed, which enabled Kenny and in particular Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed up as a BBC commentator and reached the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the award group.
Glasgow 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I was just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had accidentally fallen on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time there were no such problems with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all the flags of Great Britain lit up in the audience.
Our team became unified in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympics seems amazing."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten race paths in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, there will be a successful five-day period ahead of the Velodrome.
As Kenny has demonstrated in his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic golds at one Olympic Games.
This would mean the collection of the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in a sprint that starts today and resolves after three days.
Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice at this.
The team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
To win alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get the knight's value."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owa Doull were the fastest four-man team-drivers.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was held in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be in competition today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a contest with the competition operators before the time-drive when the journalists invited him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached world record time 4:11,260.
The British team can now count on its great cycling team to take responsibility for the mid-time Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After some very exceptional evidence from the full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has had dramas, the least of which is the termination of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and bullying claims, and the termination of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton’s competitors.
However, the competitions held on the first night at the Velodrome show that the legendary reputation of Great Britain already rises to the top at a perfect moment will be realized once again.
The future of the Portland Smelting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus thousands of workers are at stake when a power company operating at the melting plant said that one of the factory's owners is breaking down the supply contract and that all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue to grant aid to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed, 20-year support will cease in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melting plant, resulting in the failure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's smelting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
These measures correspond to speculations that have been going on in the factory for years, which first caused a strong dollar in Australia and recently the factory’s production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium sink from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects that three other melting plant owners will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa-Alumina’s joint venture. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the factory.
AGL states that it expects Portland's production plant to continue to operate, which means that physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the contracts are so-called safeguards contracts which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contract notice period is 12 months and will therefore end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the revenue to be generated by the contracts in 2017 in the financial year," says the power plant.
The potential return on investments for AGL from the financial year 2018 is currently limiting strong market prospects for the future in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of the contracts by $187 million in accounting "prejudice to the termination of contracts".
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant".
The US company announced that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still has to explain why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the weak economic situation in the country, analysts have been cautious in their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
AGL's operational director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts of tomago at the annual level.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant fall in demand (electricity) on the market.
For us as a producer it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian's live TV star Kendall as a cover girl from Vogue in September
Kardashian-Jenner's model and his mother and manager Kris' fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performed at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in the room full of my loved ones got me tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps only following the style of the Kardashianit series?), a handwritten video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barricades Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favourite, the Kardashianit producer Ryan Seacrest) who forgot to present their sister's cover picture. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
My drink is cliche, and it's used for almost all the periods of the birth of the stage programmes (Seacrest says: "Did you think we've forgotten you?" as sincerely as the drawing of children's morning TV), but Krisin had to get the rest of his daughter in some way according to this publicity.
There is no doubt that the presence of Vogue in the September issue of Vogue means a new era of Kardashians.
Kendallin's sister Kim was able to reach Vogue's suit before (he appeared on Vogue's cover together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite his own class.
The issue of September is Vogue's most sold publication a year.
A larger picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the Fashion fashion site decreased the 615 pages of ads in the 832 page study last year).
The publication of the issue of the September issue is expected to be so intense that in two previous years the pictures in the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement is made.
Former September cover models include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangeli and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more famous works of the model than models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior commercial Jennifer Lawrence was on cover in 2013, and one year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model of his generation, and although he would rather be read among the famous ones working in the model, he is quite well in company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, real-TV stars, or children today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry more than others.
Last year, Beyoncella, who appeared in the cover picture, was behind one of the strongest years of her career, when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of their true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a bad one.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them "naked."
These feelings have reshuffled to the surface when the news about Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came out.
However, the continuing aversion to unsatisfiedness seems unbearable.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking at Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's an advertising face of Estee Lauder's makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom he photographed in the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time he appears on the real TV, perhaps only as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable position in the country are being turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will have on centres already operating at the extreme limits.
In the state of Queensland, a number of applicants for legal aid and legal services are already being turned away from five people – the majority of whom are elderly, immigrants, workers in a vulnerable position, victims of violence and unjustified executions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
From next year's June, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that thousands of people are already being turned away annually from the centres, according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Organisation of Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government doesn't turn its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"The public legal aid centres in Queensland are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being turned away from the necessary services they need when applying for," says Farrell.
"People leaving violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and overwhelming burden of debt, disfellowshiping families, unduly dismissed workers – all of whom have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the weakest in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brand of Queensland to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was brought against a lawsuit against the threat of a worker with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued when no action was expected to be taken after it had been reported to its management that the leader of the North Carolina campaign had threatened the worker with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by former software trainer Vincent Bordini of the state campaign at the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Mr Bordini says he has waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, according to his own words, he realized that this would not happen.
Bordini says when he said that campaign manager Earl Phillip "unloaded the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pin into Vincent's knee. "
According to the complaint, after a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Although the gun won't fire, it will cause damage," says Bordini in her suit.
The action will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused widespread rage when he said to the people in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional round" – considered to be arms owners and arms dealers – can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and is allowed to elect the judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his word from the context and Trump, in his words, did not encourage violence.
In the run-up to the campaign, Bordini calls for compensation for indifference and for the assault, ill-treatment and mental suffering caused by Phillip.
Trump's reporter Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message that asked him to comment.
Phillip was not reached despite the company.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, told me Phillip just left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call submitted by Phillip to the Innovative Consulting Services consultancy company.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was something that was most interesting to me in Heathrow. As in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, we made an enormous contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who believe that Heathrow's expansion is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that in the eyes of the rest of the world we will be faced with an awkward situation.
Suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the environment at the airport and to the UK as a whole.
We have at Heathrow a great working group, which has been running on time and in the budget a budget of £11 billion in infrastructure investment, which included the T5 terminal – voted as the best flight terminal in the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be Heathrow's expansion.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and jobs from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Government and former Secretary of Trade at the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising in cat mouse game
The efforts of companies that earn money online to distort advertising programs have become a cat-mouse game, says one company producing prevention programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own site that it would prevent advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog, where it said that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes of its desktop site so that it would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertisements.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he has cleared out the new codes.
In his blog article, Adblock’s publisher Ben Williams wrote that “such a set-up between the open source advertising community and the scammers has been underway since the invention of advertising” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon do its own repair business again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern of advertisers in the sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use advertising programs, says a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and the share of mobile advertising in Facebook advertising revenue is already 84 percent.
However, the company intends to invest in the distortion of advertising programmes in its desktop application, as the information provider believes that mobile advertising prevention programmes do not work on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop advertising remains high enough, which is why Facebook considered the stake to be profitable.
On Tuesday Facebook also announced that it will update the advertising tool for user regulations so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, as it also prevented some regular Facebook posts from being viewed.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook's informant in his e-mail.
"Emergency programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in the development of user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertisements themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving under the cars on the Swiss highway
The victim slept on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of the eye-witnesses on the highway in the first hour of Thursday, when a woman was deliberately dumped in several cars.
An accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the Vaudi canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by laying down on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says Vaudi's police in her press release.
The victim was 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly suicide. Among the overrun cars was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
In the Le Tribune de Geneva newspaper, the lawyer, Gilles Hofstetter, tells us that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical stage in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the prosecutions against drivers involved in the accident are being brought.
"Did it be impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be investigated by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
During the last five years, two similar cases have occurred, which do not hold motorists responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked in the dark on the highway and the right decided that the drivers could not expect to run into the pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released from charges against him for the murder of a man who lay on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed alcohol and turned off the road.
The Court considered that the police – who were responding to the emergency call – were justified and that the man lying on the road was "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable".
Of all the accidents near Morges on Thursdays, some wise men are asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to estimates of NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model to study Venus' past using the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate researchers.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus may have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is surface hot and waterless and its gas cycle is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by researchers, Venus’ slow rotational speed is explained by its thick gas cycle.
On the basis of the latest simulation, however, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it has nevertheless been slowly spinning.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% darker.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus is slowly spinning and its half-day is about two months at a time," says Anthony Del Genio, a GISS researcher in the press release.
This warms the surface and gives rise to a rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud is like a umbrella and protects the surface from the large area of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the earth’s current temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of the planetary scientists about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has for several billions of years been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans extinguished, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
In Vedy's escape to space, there was only a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus air model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up his place as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his duties as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the club’s hockey team, arguing for a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
The vice president/president of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the company will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been the chief coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and the vice president of the club as hockey director, passionately and decisively," says Roy, 50 years old in his communication.
"During the summer, I've been thinking a long time about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of coach and board of hockey activities must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met."
On May 23, 2013, Sakic hired Roy to thank him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach in his first season as the Avalanche's main coach in 2013–2014.
In his lead, the club reached 112 points and won its middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to continue for the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the period 2015–2016 and stayed at the top of five points in Minnesota Wild when playing from another place in Wild Card at the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
The oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and stop the strike
The chief negotiators said that the oil workers' pay gap in the North Sea would be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participated in the new round of negotiations.
A strike against the Wood Group, which provides oil services, has been held on drilling boards owned by the Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the joint declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, dealing with the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which according to them was the first more than 25 years, in protest against any wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group is cutting its contractors' tariffs in the North Sea this year by around 9%.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in prices for contractors working in countries in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts give it the necessary space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut down thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries, making it an effort to step up its activities after its mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by the United Kingdom in June to leave the European Union create pressure for energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with the workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest job gaps experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just few people," says Anderson.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea, with around $7 billion spent on them over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleidia team
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadis.
On the basis of new information, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same constellation are running at different speeds and how orbitors are connected to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age, and even about the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the University of Caltech in Pasaden.
The star of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're running faster than they've ever been.
When the speed of rotation is at the top of the adult stars, large quantities of stars are released from the star wind.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As it grows older, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identified stars (equivalent to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data indicate that larger stars rotated slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers — larger swings slower than smaller ones.
"We see the "dance" of the Pleiadia that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because of the proximity of the Pleitadian star base, it acts as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star properties in relation to rotational speeds.
"The game star set offers a base pillar for theoretical models dealing with both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get much more information about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and end their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Pleidia's rotational speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal magazine.
