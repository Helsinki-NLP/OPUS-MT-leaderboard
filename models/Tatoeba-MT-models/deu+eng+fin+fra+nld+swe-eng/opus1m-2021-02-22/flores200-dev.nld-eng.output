Former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney won the election for presidential candidate of the Florida Republican Party by more than 46 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
Former American President of the House of Delegates Newt Gingrich became second by 32 percent.
Florida applies the principle of 'winner takes all' and granted all fifty delegates to Romney, who became the leader for the nomination of the Republican Party.
According to the organisers of the protest, about 100,000 people were present in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, the police estimated that there were 6500 demonstrators.
Also in Paris, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, in the Maltese capital Valetta, in the Estonian capital Tallinn and in the Scottish cities Edinburgh and Glasgow were protests.
In London, a protest of about 200 people took place at several copyright offices.
When Poland signed the ACTA last month, there were major protests which led to the Polish Government's decision not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Crime to Animals (RSPCA) are again making a strong commitment to hanging CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy is Chief Inspector of RSPCA New South Wales and he told the ABC that supervision and inspections of slaughterhouses in Australia must be a normal procedure.
"The surveillance cameras make it clear to the people who work with animals that the welfare of the animals is top priority."
On the international earthquake map used by the United States Geological Survey, no earthquakes were seen in Iceland in the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Institute reported no seismic activity in the last 48 hours in Hekla.
The large amount of earthquakes that caused a phase transition took place on March 10 on the northeastern side of the upper caldera of the volcano.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds caused confusion as to whether the volcano had really broken out.
There was 120-160 cubic metres of fuel on board the Luno when the ship had engine problems and was pushed by the hard wind and waves against the breaker.
The 12 crew members have been secured with helicopters, the only injury being a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to pick up the usual cargo fertilizer, and initially the authorities feared that the vessel could leak with the cargo.
In 2011, both parts of the Congress voted in favour of the proposed amendment.
This legislative session was amended when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then adopted by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
Failure to comply with the second judgment, which states that cohabitants of the same sex are not allowed, could lead in the future to this being allowed.
HJR-3 will be reviewed in accordance with the procedure by the next elected legislative authority in 2015 or 2016.
The director Vautier will also be remembered for his hunger strike in 1973 against political censorship, as he says.
He was an activist at the age of 15 when he decided to join the French opposition in World War II.
He recorded himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s he returned to the newly independent Algeria to teach film direction.
Winner of two Olympic gold medals, Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, died at the age of 54.
It was reported that the cause of death was galloid cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
Saito was not only the former Olympic and World Champion, but also the chairman of the training committee of the All Japan Judo Federation at the time of his death.
At least 100 people attended the party that celebrated the first wedding day of a couple who married last year.
A formal anniversary event was planned for a later date, according to the officials.
The couple married a year ago in Texas and celebrated it in Buffalo with friends and family.
The 30-year-old husband was born in Buffalo and one of the four people killed at the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory. He claimed to have 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents attacked on names and he would have used blasphemy in the class.
Modern Education accuses him that he placed large ads on buses without permission and that he acted as the principal teacher in English.
Earlier he was accused of copyrighting, but he was not prosecuted for this.
An old student said that he was 'a friend of the students' in street language in the classroom, a teacher in dating skills in notes and just a friend of the students'.
In the last three decades, despite the fact that China is still officially a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic changes were carried out under the direction of Deng Xiaoping.
From then on, the Chinese economy has grown 90 times in size.
Last year, China first exported more cars than Germany and even the USA, with which it was the largest market in the industry.
China’s GDP may be greater than that of the United States within two decades.
The fourth tropical storm over the Atlantic in the 2010 season, called Danielle, has formed in the east of the ocean.
The storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will reach hurricane power around Wednesday.
Since the storm has not long been extinguished, it remains difficult to estimate the possible effects on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreb (the capital of Croatia), became famous when he played for the club Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and continued to play for them until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.
No one else has ever appeared or made more targets for the club than Bobek.
He was chosen as the best player in Partizan history in 1995.
The festivities were kicked off with a special show by the world famous group Cirque du Soleil.
After that, the Staats-Symphonieorkest van Istanbul, a Janitsar band and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses followed.
Then the Whirling Dervishes came up on stage.
The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu shared the stage with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the show 'Troy' was performed by the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia.
After an accident on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the thirteen-year-old motor driver Peter Lenz died.
During his warm-up round, Lenz fell off his bike, and was hit by co-driver Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the medical staff present and transported to a local hospital, where he died later.
Zayat didn't get hurt in the accident.
Zapatero continued that, given the global financial situation, 'the financial system is an essential part of the economy.
We have been in a financial crisis for a year that has reached a peak in the last two months, and I expect the financial market to start to recover now.'
Last week, Naked News announced that it will dramatically expand international reporting with three new broadcasts in different languages.
The global organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, but is now launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a frightening spectacle: people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows made it and they started climbing out of the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Because of the energy released by the fusion (or fusion) of hydrogen atoms to form heavier elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists develop a reactor that can generate energy in this way.
This problem, however, is difficult to solve, and it will take many years before usable nuclear reactors are built.
The steel needle is driven by the surface tension on the water.
The surface tension is created by the fact that the water molecules react to the surface of the water more strongly than they react to the air molecules above.
On the surface of the water mirror, the water molecules create a kind of skin layer that cannot be seen, so that objects like needles drift on.
The irons of modern skates have a double edge with a hollow void between them. The two edges provide more grip on the ice, also when making curves.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly bent and the knife tilts to either side, the edge that comes into contact with the ice will also be bent.
This will turn the skater. If the skaters are turned right, the skater turns right and if they are turned left, the skater turns left.
They must lose the extra energy from the light in order to return to the previous energy level.
They do this by radiating a little light, called a 'photon'.
Scientists call this process a 'stimulated emission of radiation', because the bright light stimulates the atoms, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a kind of radiation.
The following photo shows atoms that send photos. In reality, photos are of course a bit smaller than in the photo.
Photons are even smaller than the particles of which atoms are made!
After hundreds of hours of burning, the filament will eventually burn through the lamp, after which the filament will no longer work.
The pear should then be replaced. Be careful when replacing the pear.
First of all, the switch of the light luminaire must be switched off or the cable removed from the stop switch.
This is because the electricity flowing into the stop-contact where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the stop-contact or the metal foot of the lamp if it is still partly in the stop-contact.
The most important organ in the blood vessel system is the heart that pumpes the blood.
Blood leaves the heart through some kind of tubes, called arteries, and comes back to the heart through other tubes, veins. The smallest tubes are called hair vessels.
With its teeth, a Triceratops might have broken not only leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think that the triceratops ate cycades. That's a type of plant that was a great occurrence of the Cretaceous Age.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, thorny leaves.
With his strong cord, a Triceratops could have picked up the leaves of the stem before eating the stem.
According to other scientists, these plants are highly toxic and were not eaten by dinosaurs. Even though some animals that live today, such as leopards and parrots (dinosaurs' offspring) can leaf or eat fruit species that are toxic.
What effect does the gravity of Io have on me? On the surface of Io you weigh less than on earth.
A person weighing 90 kg on earth would weigh about 16 kg on Io, which means that gravity is less attractive to you.
The sun does not have a tangible outer layer such as the earth’s crust, but consists entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
As you move on from the core of the sun, the gas becomes thinner.
When you look at the sun, the outer part is that you see the photosphere, i.e. 'ball of light'.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer used a telescope and discovered that Venus, like the moon, shows phases.
If only the side of Venus (or the moon) to the sun is illuminated, then phases arise. Copernicus' theory that planets rotate around the sun is supported by the phases of Venus.
The transition of Venus was observed a few years later, in 1639, by Jeremiah Horrocks, an astronomer from England.
After the Danelaw was rebuilt, it was long peace in England.
Ethelred came across an eye in 911 with a Viking fleet that was much larger than that of Guthrum a century earlier.
The fleet leader was Olaf Trygvassion, a Norwegian who wanted to rebuild his country on the Danes.
After a number of military setbacks, Ethelred and Olaf agreed. Ethelred returned to Norway to win his kingdom with varying success.
The only consciously designed alphabet that is still in daily use is Hangul. It was designed in 1444 under King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth and one of the most respected kings of the Joseon dynasty.
He first called the Hangeula alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning 'the right sounds to instruct the people'.
There are many theories about the origin of the Sanskriet, one of which is about the migration of Aryans from the West to India, who took their own language.
Sanskrit is an old language and is similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The world's oldest known book is in the Sanskriet, which was defeated after the Upanishads were drawn up.
Sanskriet has formed the source for a large number of modern Indian languages and is a very complex and extensive language. Latin formed the source for European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle over France was over, Germany prepared for the invasion of the island of Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name 'Operation Seelöwe'. Most of the heavy weapons and stocks of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Duinkerken, which seriously weakened the army.
The Royal Navy, however, was still stronger than the German Navy ('War Marine') and could have destroyed any invader who would cross the English Channel.
However, there were few royal naval ships that lay close to logical attack routes, because the admirals were afraid they would be brought to a sink in a German air attack.
First, we are going to talk about the plans of Italy, the little one facing 'big brothers' Germany and Japan.
Both his army and the fleet were weaker, despite the fact that four new ships had been manufactured just before the war.
The main aims of Italy were African countries, which needed a strategic opening for their troops to conquer them so that they could invade the Mediterranean.
They had to leave the British bases and ships in Egypt for that purpose. Besides these actions, Italy's battleships were not allowed to do anything else.
And then we have Japan, just like Great Britain, Japan was an island state.
Underseas are vessels specially designed to sail under water for a longer period of time.
Submarines were deployed in the First and Second World Wars. At that time they were very slow and had a limited range of weapons.
In the first phase of the war, they often moved on, but when radar developments led to greater accuracy, submarines had to dive to remain invisible.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very busy in the control and navigation of their submarines.
Germans had great successes with submarines and therefore they are not familiar with too many submarines after the war.
Yes! King Tutanhamon is one of the best known kings of ancient Egypt today.
However, in ancient times he was not considered important and he was not included in most of the lists of ancient kings.
Because of the discovery of his tomb in 1922 he became a celebrity. Although many old tombs have been robbed, his tomb remained virtually untiring.
Most of the objects buried together with Tutanchamon are well preserved, including many artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the Spanish wheel, Assyrian chariots became lighter, faster, and thus better equipped for the escape of soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows shot with the deadly cross arches could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. The first calvary was introduced by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. Because the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of their horses.
We are familiar with many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Homerus is probably the most famous Greek person: the legendary blind poet who wrote two Greek literary poems: Ilias and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular play writers and their pieces are counted as the top of world literature.
Another famous Greek mathematician is Pythagoras. He has become known by his famous attitude about the relationship between the different sides of rectangular triangles.
Estimates of the number of Hindi speakers vary from one to three languages worldwide.
It is obvious whether the very strongly related dialects are counted or not, how many native speakers are there.
It is estimated that there are 340 million to 500 million speakers, and about 800 million people can understand the language.
With regard to vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are similar, but the writing differs; speakers of both languages can usually understand each other in everyday conversations.
Around the fifteenth century, northern Estonia was strongly culturally influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring the original population into contact with God and therefore developed the Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character was added.
In the course of time, many German loan words were merged. This was the beginning of the illumination.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne would go directly into the army after completing the school.
Charles, however, went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a 2:2 (a lower, second class diploma) by studying anthropology, archaeology and later history.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a diploma.
The European part of Turkey (East Thrace or Roemelia in the Balkans) accounts for 3% of the land area.
The Turkish territory covers more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 miles) in width and has a bit of a rectangle.
Turkey's surface area, including lakes, is about 783.562 km2 (300.948 m2), of which about 755.688 km2 (291.773 m2) is located in South-West Asia and about 23.764 km2 (9174 m2) is located in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is about as big as Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey borders on three sides of a sea: the Aegean Sea on the west side, the Black Sea on the north side and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it has only been independent since 1839.
Parts of current Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg and came into Belgian hands after the Belgian Revolution in the 1930s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but was occupied by Germany both in the First and Second World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg co-founded the organisation we know today as the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a fallen fort and Buddhist monastery in the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
According to the tradition, the fortress was made in 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate his victory on the Tibetan Mongolian troops.
After a fire in 1951 there are only a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong left, including the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fortress was preserved and protected after the fire, and it also remained one of Bhutan's most spectacular sights.
In the 18th century Cambodia was surrounded by two powerful neighbours: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century Cambodia was invaded several times by the Thais, and in 1772 Phnom Phen was destroyed.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of the Venezuelan population is unemployed, most of whom are employed in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, one quarter of which work in the industrial sector and one fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for the Venezuelans, as the country is a net exporter; yet only one per cent of the population is employed in the oil industry.
In the early years of the country's independence, experts from Singapore's botanical gardens helped to enchant the island in a tropical city garden.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a cross of orchids, was chosen as a national flower.
Around October, almost 1.5 million herbivores move from the northern hills to the southern plains because it rains there each year, passing the Mara River.
And after the rain of April again northward through the west, again through the river Mara.
The Serengeti region comprises the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Nature Reserve, the Maswa Wildlife Reserve in Tanzania and the Masai Mara National Nature Reserve in Kenya.
In order to create interactive media, you need to manage conventional and traditional techniques and can deal with tools in interactive training (storyboards, audio and video assembly, story techniques, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reconsider your assumptions about media production and that you learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive design, parts of the project are connected to each other, but they are also self-evident.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that you need much more focal complexity and lens components than for prime lenses to reach a number of focal distances.
Now that lens manufacturers are handling ever higher standards in the manufacture of lenses, this is becoming less and less a problem.
This gave zoom lenses a comparable photo quality as lenses with a fixed focal distance.
Zoom lenses also have as a disadvantage that the maximum diaphragm (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use when there is little light and no flash is used.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to a DVD format is the overscan.
TVs are usually made to please the general public.
Therefore, you can see on TV that the edges on the top and bottom and on the sides are often cut off.
This is so designed that the image covers the entire screen. That's called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, the edges are also cut off. If the subtitle of the video is placed too close to the bottom edge, it is not displayed in its entirety.
The traditional medieval castle has long spoken to the imagination and evokes images of knights' games, banquets and knighthood as Arthur's.
Even if you stand between the thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-flooded battles. You hear almost climbing the need on the street stones and smelling how the fear increases in the churches.
The question is whether our imagination is based on reality. Why did we start building castles at some point? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle is more a fortified mansion than a real castle, which is characteristic for this time.
With its large windows and thin walls, it would not have been long against a serious attack.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, it was relatively peaceful in the country and only small groups of roamers posed a danger.
The relationship of power was a system by which European countries wanted to preserve the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept meant that all European countries should prevent one country from becoming too powerful and that national governments should regularly enter into new alliances to keep the balance.
The Spanish Succession War was the first war in which the power relations were central.
This was an important change, since the European powers would no longer have a pretext for the conduct of religious wars, which could make the Thirty-Year War the last religious war.
On July 21, 356, the temple of Artemis near Ephesus was burned by Herostratus and destroyed.
According to the story, he was driven at a cost by fame. The Ephesians were indignant and said that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The name was later mentioned by the Greek historian Strabo, so that we still know it today. The temple was destroyed on the night of the birth of Alexander the Great.
During his reign Alexander was willing to pay for a reconstruction, but this was rejected. After his death the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Try to hit all the nuts with as little tension as possible and excess movements with your hand.
Don't get so tired. Don't forget that you don't have to hit the keys with much power for extra volume like on the piano.
To make more sound with the accordion, press the nails harder or faster.
Mystic is believing in, identifying with or consciousness of an ultimate reality, deity, spiritual truth or God.
The churchgoer strives for a direct perception, intuition, or insight into divine reality.
The followers strive for a certain way of life or want to gain experiences that give them the same feeling.
Contrary to other religious beliefs and worship, mystic emphasis is placed on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, discreet, happy or ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It arose in the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition in the Punjab region.
The faith is seen by Sikhs as a separate religion, although the origin and tradition of Hinduism are recognized.
The religion of the Sikhs they themselves call 'gurmat', Punjabi for 'the path of guru'. Goroes play a fundamental role in all religions in India, but in particular form the core of the beliefs of Sikhism.
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) founded the religion in the 15th century, followed by nine gurus.
But the promises of Khrushchev were put to the test in June 1956, when riots changed in Poland, where workers demonstrated against food shortages and wage cuts, namely in a general protest against communism.
In the end, Krushchev sent tanks to repair the order, agreeing to a number of economic demands and agreeing to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
The Bronze Age Industry was located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent and comprised most of contemporary Pakistan, some regions in the northwest of India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the rivers of the Indus and also thanks its name to this river.
Although some scientists suspect that 'Indusbeschouving' is the appropriate name for the civilization that lived in the basins of the dried Sarasvatirivier, others call it the Harappanschouving to Harappa, the first excavation site from the 20th century.
Thanks to the militaristic nature of the Roman Empire, development could be achieved in medical progress.
Emperor Augustus recruited doctors who were also the first Roman medical corps to be deployed after wars.
Surgicalians knew various sedatives, including morphine of extracts of moon seed and scopolamine from bilze herb.
They were amputation experts with the aim of saving patients from gangrene and were also committed to the application of tourniquets and arterial limbs to stop bleeding.
The Roman Empire has been very successful in medicine for many centuries and is responsible for many of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is an origami where only one fold is allowed once. Complexer ways of folding, such as folding, may not be allowed, and only right forward folds.
John Smith designed this in the 1970s, to support inexperienced foldrs or foldrs with limited motor skills.
Children already develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes at an early age and these can affect their behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who, according to the stereotype, do not do well in school tend to confirm this assumption once they know that the stereotype is associated with their race.
MySpace is the second most popular website in the United States and currently contains 54 million profiles.
These websites have attracted much attention, particularly from education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as being able to easily set up a class page where blogs, videos, photos and other features can stand.
Access to this page is easy by giving up only one webadres, making it easy to remember and can easily be enteredypted by students who have difficulty spelling or using a keyboard.
It can be adapted to read easily with as much or little color as you want.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a neurological syndrome that occurs in a combination of three classic characteristic symptoms, such as impulseivity, distraction and hyperactivity or too much energy.
It is a learning disorder and not a learning disability. It affects 3 to 5 percent of all children and up to 2 million children from America'.
Kids with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like schoolwork. However, they can focus on things they like, such as games, their favorite cartoons or phrases without interpunishing.
These children often work in the nests because they 'display risky behavior, argue and challenge authorities'. They do this to stimulate their brains, because their brains are not to stimulate with normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with peers. Other children often do not understand why the ADD'er responds in a certain way or plays words differently. There may also be too much difference in adulthood.
The basic pace with which knowledge was accumulated changed, because the ability to acquire and learn knowledge in the way described above changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no more pressure within the individual call, but the focus was more on the possibility of calling back text.
In essence, the Renaissance caused a major change in the way of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands to move, carry, or wave through the trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee have a similar size and length and reflect the use of the hand for carrying the weight when walking on the knuckles.
The hand of homo sapiens is shorter than the foot, and has right jaws.
Stearing cuffs of about two to three million years old show this shift from movement to manipulation in hand specialisation.
There are also people who think that if you often experience artificially induced lucid dreams, this can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams extend the time between the different REM sleep states.
If you don't get enough brake sleep every night, your body won't recover quickly enough to make it a problem at some point.
This is just as exhausting as if you would wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch the TV.
The effect depends on the number of times your brain tries to dream brightly every night.
With the Italians in North Africa it was not good from the beginning. After Italy declared the war on 10 June 1940, Fort Capuzzo was seized in Libya within a week by the 11th British Huzars.
During an ambush to the east of Bardia, the British General Lastucci, the Italian tenth engineer of the army, captured.
On 28 June, italic Italo Balbo, the Libyan governor general of Libya and intended successor to Mussolini, died in Tobroek by friendly fire when they landed there.
Modern screen sports are played at all levels, from students learning it at university to Olympic level.
The sport is played mainly in duels, with two screens playing with each other.
Golf is a game where players have to hit balls with a club in a hole.
In a regular round 18 holes are played. Players start in principle on the first hole of the job and end up at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least turns or succeeds with the club to complete the course is the winner.
It is played on grass, which is reduced around the hole (green).
The most common form of tourism is perhaps what almost everyone associated with travel: recreationism.
This happens when people go to a place that is different from their daily environment and relax and enjoy there.
Tourists often find beaches, amusement parks and camping grounds for recreation.
If someone visits a specific place with the aim of learning something about the history and culture of that place, then we call this cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions of a particular country or explore a specific area.
That was also what the colonists had called for.
The first and third regiment of New Hampshire, consisting of 200 men under the leadership of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later promoted to generals), was part of the troops that had to strengthen the forward position.
The men of Stark took positions along the gate all the way north of where the colonist was.
When the Mystic River and the north-eastern part of the peninsula emerged during eb space, they quickly extended the gate with a short stone wall towards the north to the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed at about 100 feet (30 meters) before the gate a stake and ordered everyone to wait with shots until the regular troops were over.
The U.S. plan maintained coordinated attacks from three different directions.
According to this plan, General John Cadwalder, as a distraction, would attack the British Garnizon at Bordentown to prevent reinforcements.
General James Ewing, with 700 members of his militia, crossed the river near Trenton Ferry, conquered the bridge crossing the Assunpink River, and knew how to prevent hostile troops from escaping.
The largest assault of 2400 men crossed the river, some 9 miles above Trenton, and split up into two groups, a group led by Greene, and a group led by Sullivan, to be able to attack before sunrise.
Now that the run is not a quarter of a mile, but half a mile, it's less about speed and much more about endurance.
Of course, a first class half-mile, i.e. a person with a time of less than two minutes, must have a good speed, although the endurance must be protected at all times.
It is best prepared for the running season with some field runs in winter in combination with breast training in the sports school.
A good diet alone is not enough to perform at the top level, but is very important for the general well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, putting effective hydration habits into practice and understanding the various aspects of supplements will enable athletes to improve their performance and enjoy more of the sport.
Hard running at medium distance is less expensive compared to other sports, but there are many misunderstandings about the few required equipment for participation.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most products have little to no real impact on performance.
Atletes may have the feeling of preferring a product, even if that product has no real benefits.
The atom is seen as a fundamental building block for all matter.
It is a complex whole that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central core surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting the sun - see figure 1.1.
The core consists of two parts: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
In order to investigate the victim, you must first check the environment in order to guarantee your own safety.
You have to watch the victim's position and any alarms you may have when you approach him or her.
If you get hurt trying to help, you might just make it worse.
This study showed that the link between abdominal pain and disability is based on depression, fear and fear of catastrophe.
The regular weekly structured PA sessions had only an effect on catastrophic thinking and not on depression and fear.
Participants in the regular activity needed more support in the area of negative pain perception, making clear the difference between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement.
Visibility, or ability to see, depends on the senses of the visual system or eyes.
There are a large number of different types of eye constructions, which vary in complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
The different constructions have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have other sharpness levels. In addition, they require different processing to be able to be wise from the input and different figures to work optimally.
The concept of population refers to a group of organisms belonging to the same specific species within a specific geographical region.
In the PALM trial ZMapp was used as a control, which means that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.If all individuals in a population have the same phenotypic properties, they are known as monomorphs.
On the other hand, if they show different variations of a particular characteristic, it is called polymorphism.
Colonies of predators march and plant in different phases.
Roofmies move on in the nomadic phase at night and they stop during the day to rest.
When the food sources available decrease, the colony lives for a certain time as a nomadic species. During this period, they make a temporary nest every day in another place.
All these nomadic storms or marches last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The Latin word 'cella' is the origin of the word, this means 'small space'. The word was first conceived by a microscope who studied the structure of cork.
Every living being is made up of one or more cells: they form the basis of life.
When you study life, cells are so fundamental and crucial that they are often called 'the building blocks of life'.
By driving nerve impulses through the body, the nervous system keeps homeostasis at a level and can continuously pass through the bloodstream.
The nerve impulses pass through the body very quickly. This promotes the safety of the body in case of potential danger.
Compared to other heavy storms, the affected area of tornados is relatively small, but everything that comes on their path is destroyed.
The damage to tornadoes includes unrooted trees, murals and high-drained cars. They can last for a very long time, up to three hours for the two percent most violent tornados.
Such sample storms may have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for thousands of years to expand things.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe by the end of the 16th century.
By combining two lenses, objects in these telescopes appear both closer and larger.
Man will always remain greedy and selfish, and in cooperation it is always the case that if the majority benefits from something, it will in the short term benefit more from acting selfishly.
It is hoped that most people will realize that in the long term it is best to work with others.
Many people dream of the day that we can travel to another star and discover other worlds. Some people wonder what to find in space and some believe that there are aliens or other forms of life on another planet.
But if this ever happens, it will only be in a long time. The stars are apart so many trillion miles between stars that are considered 'neighbours'.
Maybe your great-grandchildren are one day on top of an extraterrestrial world and they're wondering how it's been with their ancestors?
Animals are many cells, they eat things and eat this food in their stomachs. Most animals can move forward.
Only animals have brains (although they don't all have brains, for example, the bulls don't have brains).
They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest part of a living being or organism with its structural and functional properties.
The word 'cell' is derived from the word 'cell' from Latin, which is a small room.
When you look at living things with a microscope, you see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small cork squares with a microscope.
He was the first person to notice dead cells.
Elements and compositions can be brought from one state to another without changing.
As a gas, nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state has a higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Another example is water, which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, the molecular structure is the same.
The chemical state remains the same, although the physical state may change.
Time is all around us, it affects everything we do, but it remains something incomprehensible.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go from the future through the present to the past.
The duration (length) of events is also compared over time.
If you observe the recurrence of a cyclic event, you can mark the end of time yourself. A cyclic event is an event that regularly occurs again and again.
Today, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Complex animations can be made on the computer, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and in movies.
Advanced computers are often used to record music with the aim of processing and mixing sounds.
For a large part of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it was believed that the earliest inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted on huge birds called moas.
The theory led to the idea that the Maori people came from Polynesia and conquered New Zealand on the Moriori, after which an agricultural society was formed.
However, there are new indications that the Moriori were a group of Maoris on the mainland who moved from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham and built a personal, peaceful community there.
Another tribe on the Catham Islands were Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori and after a few paratroopers and the Moriori were finally wiped out
People with decades of experience helped us assess our strengths and our passions, while they openly assessed the difficulties and even the mistakes.
Listening to individuals who shared their story about themselves, their family or the organization gave us valuable insights into the past and the people who have influenced business culture in any way whatsoever.
While understanding someone’s past is not the same as understanding the culture, it helps people at least to get a sense of where they are in the history of the organization.
During the evaluation of the success and the awareness of errors, all participants will find out what the values, the mission and the driving force of the organisation are.
In these circumstances, it was very useful to look at earlier examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and the successes that came from it, because this made people susceptible to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Thanks to such success stories, the fear of changing has been reduced and changes in the future are at the same time more positive.
With thinking patterns that converge, you can come to a solution by combining different concepts or areas.
The focus of this mindset is on speed, logical thinking and accuracy, as well as the determination of facts, the re-use of existing techniques and the collection of information.
In this way of thinking, first of all, there is only one correct answer, and there are only two possible answers: right or wrong.
This approach is consistent with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, be able to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific research.
As a species, mankind is by far the best in reading out one’s intentions.
That means that we can predict well what other people perceive, mean, believe, know or desire.
It is important to understand the intent of others, so that we can remove possible ambiguity from physical actions.
For example, if you see someone in the window of a car, you probably assume that this person is trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he tried to break into his own car because he lost his keys, he must be evaluated in another way.
The physics phenomenon behind MRI is called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
Thanks to the magnetic field and the radio waves, atoms in this resonance emit tiny radio signals.
Raymond Damadian is a physician and researcher who discovered in 1970: he encountered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the first MRI patent in the world.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian built the first MRI scanner for the 'whole body'. He called the scanner the 'inviolable'.
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and to respond to others.
Thus, students can determine how quickly they work and receive instructions.
In addition, there are fewer time limits now that it is possible to have flexible working hours (Bremer 1998).
The use of the Internet and the global web offer students the opportunity to always have access to information.
Instead of waiting for the next face-to-face appointment, students can ask their supervisors at any time of the day and get a fairly quick answer.
The post-modernist learning approach offers absolute freedom. There is no right way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good way to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the one who learns and the one who transmits knowledge.
This point is reflected in all educational and do-it-yourself programs.
Many of us are watching television programmes about situations or experiences that we're never going to experience, and that we're never going to do anything about.
We will never pop up a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to see old ruins or renovate the house of our neighbours.
Greenland has good connections with Europe and broadband satellite thanks to its undersea fibre cable connections. 93% of the population has Internet access.
Your hotel or host family (when staying in a private house or guest house) probably has wifi or a PC with internet and in all places you can find an internet café or a location with public wifi.
As mentioned earlier, the word 'Eskimo' is regarded by many non-American Arctic populations as denigrating, especially in Canada. However, use is still accepted in the US.
You may have heard of the term Greenlandic Natives, but this word should be avoided by foreigners.
In Greenland, natives call themselves Inuit when they are in Canada, and Kalaalleq (multiple Kalaallit), which means a Greenlander when they are in Greenland.
Misdeed, and generally maliciousness to outsiders, hardly occurs in Greenland. Even in villages there is no 'dangerous area'.
Cold is probably the only real danger to someone who's unprepared.
When you visit Greenland in the cold season (as it gets colder as you go further north) it is very important to bring enough warm clothes.
The long days in summer can make it difficult to get enough sleep and can lead to related health problems.
Also look out for the Norwegian mosquitoes during the summer months. Although they do not pass on any diseases, they can be annoying.
Although the San Francisco economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The largest employment is created by professional services, the government, the financial sector, trade and tourism.
The frequent interpretation of films, music, literature and popular culture has led to the city and its monuments being famous all over the world.
San Francisco has a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and top facilities for congresses.
For Eastern cuisine (Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese) you can go to San Francisco.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a major milestone for many American families.
A 'typical' visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to a Disney hotel on site, a stay of one week without leaving Disney Park, and the return journey home.
Although there are infinitely many variations, most people really mean this when they say that they are going 'to Disneyland'.
Many online tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partly used multi-day Park Hopper tickets.
Despite the fact that this happens a lot, it is forbidden by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
You need a permit to camp under the Grand Canyon.
Licences shall be restricted to protect the mountain gap and shall be made available on the 1st day of the month, four months in advance.
A backcountry permit with a start date in May is therefore available on 1 January.
In the most popular places, the available places can be reached quickly, for example the Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, which is generally filled on the first available reservation day.
A limited number of permits are available for entry requests based on the first one, first one.
If you want to see all the beauty of the south of Africa well, you can do the best by car. Also, you come to places where the regular tourist routes do not come.
This can be recommended in a regular car if you plant it properly, but a 4x4 is recommended; many locations are accessible only with a 4x4 with high wheel base.
Keep in mind when planning that, although the situation in southern Africa is stable, this does not apply to all neighbouring countries.
The costs and requirements for a visa vary by country and are determined by the country of origin.
Each country has unique rules on which items for emergency situations should be present in a car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, just across the border from Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The place is located right next to the waterfalls. These are the largest tourist attractions, but this popular tourist destination has plenty of opportunities for both adventurers and standard tourists to offer for a longer stay.
The amount of water is larger in the rainy season (November to March) and the waterfalls are more spectacular.
If you weigh on the bridge or loop paths along the waterfalls, you will certainly not come back dry.
In addition, the huge volume of water ensures that you can see the waterfalls less well.
Tombe of Tutanchamon (KV62). It might well be that KV62 is the most famous tomb in the valley. Moreover, this is the place where Howard Carters discovered the almost intact royal tomb of the young king in 1922.
The tomb of Toetanchamon is, compared to the other royal tombs, hardly worth a visit because it is smaller and has only minimal decorations.
You can only see the head and shoulders of the mummy, so you see nothing of the damage done when trying to get him out of the box.
The magnificent treasures have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are no longer in the tomb.
Visitors who are cramped in time should be able to go somewhere else.
Phnom Krom, 12 km south-west direction of Siem Reap. This temple was built at the end of the 9th century under King Yasovarman on a hill.
Climbing the hill is worth the effort because of the vocal atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonlé Sapmeer.
A visit to this place can be well combined with a tour of the lake.
For access to the temple you need an Angkor Pass, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although many other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem is both the capital city and the largest city of Israel.
The old town in the Judean Mountains has a fascinating history that is thousands of years old.
For Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the holy city is a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
Jerusalem, which is important for religions, is one of Israel’s most popular tourist destinations because of the many sights in the ancient core.
In Jerusalem you will find a wide variety of historical, archaeological and cultural attractions, as well as lively and busy shopping centers, cafes and dining facilities.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to show an invitation before entering Ecuador via international airports or border posts.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador must legalise the letter and it must comply with certain requirements.
In order to allow for an organised flow of migration between the two countries, these requirements have been laid down.
Cuban citizens who have a Green Card in the US must go to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the travel date. A return ticket is required to show the duration of your stay.
The tour prices are lower for groups with more people, so if you are with one or two, you can try to form a group of four to six with others for a lower price per person.
There, however, you do not have to worry about it, because tourists are often pushed back and forth to fill cars.
It seems to be more of a way to make people think that a greater payment should be made.
High above the northernmost point of Machu Picchu towering this steep mountain. Often this mountain is used as a background for the many photos of the ruins.
It looks rather exciting from below, because it is a steep and difficult climb, but in principle it must be possible for fat people in 45 minutes.
For the most part of the path are stone steps to be found and for the steeper sections steel cables are placed as leaning.
Nevertheless, it is very exhausting and you should watch out for the steeper pieces, as they can be dangerous especially in the case of wetness.
Right at the top is a small cave where you have to go through. It's pretty low and narrow.
You can see the Galapagos Islands and the wild animals that live there best by boat, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835.
In the waters around the Galapagos Islands, more than 60 cruise ships can accommodate 8 to 100 passengers.
The boats are usually full in the high season and therefore most people already book their place well in advance.
Make sure you book with a Galapagos expert with a lot of knowledge of the wide variety of ships.
This ensures that your specific interests and/or restrictions are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the central and southern Chile was inhabited by the native Araucans (Mapuche).
The Mapuche was one of the last independent indigenous American groups to be included in the Spanish rule only after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the middle of the Napoleonic wars, which had no functioning central government for a few years), it was only in 1818 that decisive victory was achieved on the Spanish.
The Dominican Republic (República Dominica) is a Caribbean country made up of the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola. Haiti forms the other part of the island.
The country is home to not only white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, but also the oldest European city in America, which has since been built in Santo Domingo.
First the island was inhabited by the Taínos and the Caribbean. The Caribbean were an Arawakan-speaking people who had descended here around 10,000 BC.
After the explorers arrived from Europe, the population of Tainos had already been wiped out by the Spanish conquerors after a few years.
The conquerors from Spain finished around 100.000 Taínos from 1492 to 1498, according to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias)
Jardín de la Unión. Previously this room was the atrium of a 17th century monastery, the Temple de San Diego is the only building that still exists.
It is now used as a central square and there is day and night to do everything.
There are several restaurants near the garden. In the afternoon and in the evening free concerts are given in the central hall.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies that are 69 cm apart are the beginning of an old love legend.
Give them some money and some kids tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for a day trip or weekend trip. You can visit kayaks, long walks, shopping and restaurants.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound, just outside Vancouver. It is easy to reach with regular departure water taxis from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
If you like outside activities, you should not miss a trip over the Sea to Sky Corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours per car from Vancouver) is expensive, but is known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, this is one of the best North American ski resorts and in summer, you can go mountain biking.
You must have reserved a permit in advance, and you must be in possession of a permit to stay at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station where you can not only camp, but also enjoy a warm meal and stay in a dormitory. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos you can only camp, but no meals are served.
You can buy parking permits directly from the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, although they do not accept credit cards here.
No parking permits shall be issued by the Park Service (MINAE) if the scheduled arrival takes more than one month.
At CafeNet El Sol you can reserve a daily card for a fee of $30 or $10; the details are on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is a country of free association with New Zealand. The islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
The archipelago consists of 15 islands spread over an ocean surface of 2.2 million km2.
The islands are sometimes called 'Hawaii down under' because of the equal time zone with Hawaii.
It may be smaller, but it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
There are no cities on the Cook Islands, but they consist of fifteen different islands. The most famous islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Luxurious bed and breakfasts offered in rich countries have become today a form of art.
In the top segment, B&Bs are of course particularly competitive on two important points: bed and breakfast.
In the most beautiful establishments you will often find the most luxurious bedware, or perhaps a handmade spread or an antique bed.
At breakfast you can get seasonal treats, or the specialty of the house.
It may be in an antique furnished historic building with a well-kept garden and swimming pool.
Steps in your own car and make a long tour, has an intrinsic appeal because it is so simple.
You are probably already used to driving in your own car and you know its limitations, unlike larger vehicles.
The setting-up of a tent in a private area or in a place of random size may result in unwanted attention.
In short: your car is ideal to make a road trip, but is rarely useful to 'champ'.
Camping in your car is possible if you have a large van, SUV, sedan or station wagon where the seats can be folded down.
There are hotels whose history dates back to the 19th and early 20th centuries (often the golden century of steam trains and ocean steamers) before the WOII.
In these hotels the rich and the celebrities stayed and they often offered a refined dining and entertainment life.
Also characteristic are the old-fashioned clothing, the lack of modern facilities and a kind of elegant old age.
They are usually owned by a private person, but sometimes visiting heads of state and other high-quality servants are housed.
A traveller with enough money can consider a flight around the world that is divided into many of these hotels.
Travellers are contacted by the hospitality exchange network with local residents in the cities where they go.
Usually you just need to fill in an online form to connect to such a network; all you offer or require is some additional verification.
A paper or online list of available host families is then provided, sometimes together with references and reviews of other travellers.
In January 2004, computer programmer Casey Fenton booked a cheap flight to Iceland, but had no place to stay: couch surfing was a fact.
He sent students to the local university e-mails and received huge offers for free accommodation.
The typical guest for a hostel is relatively young, in the twenty, but there are also older visitors.
Families with children do not see much of it, but some hostels do offer private rooms for families.
Beijing City in China will host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, the first city to host both the summer and winter Games.
Beijing will organise the opening and closing ceremonies and the events on the indoor ice rink.
Other ski events can be found in the ski resort Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples have an annual festival from the end of November to mid May, but this varies per temple and per year calendar.
Most of the temple festivals are part of the anniversary of a temple or of the deity of the temple or of other major events related to the temple.
Kerala’s temple festivals are very interesting to attend and there is a regular procession of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivals.
A world exhibition (usually called World Exhibition or simply Expo) is a major international art and science festival.
Participating countries set up artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase the world issue or the culture and history of their country.
International horticulture exhibitions are events for connoisseurs with flora exhibitions, botanical gardens other plant-related matters.
In theory, these can take place annually (though in other countries), but in reality this is not the case.
These events usually take place between three and six months and take place on sites of at least 50 hectares.
Many different film formats have been used over the years. The standard film of 35 mm (negative of 36 at 24 mm) is much more common.
Normally, it can be simply refilled when it is up and offers a resolution that corresponds more or less to a current DSLR.
For some cameras in medium format, 6 in 6 cm is used or, more precisely, 56 in 56 mm is used.
This ensures a resolution nearly four times the size of a negative resolution of 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864).
One of the most challenging subjects for a photographer is wild animals and this requires a combination of patience, happiness, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography may often be seen as self-evident, but this is the case with photography in general: a photograph says more than a thousand words.
Wild photography often requires a long telelens, although for example a group of birds or a small animal requires another lens.
It can often be difficult to see exotic animals and in parks are sometimes rules for commercial photography.
Wild animals are restrained or hostile, and the environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are more than 5000 languages worldwide, of which more than 20 have at least 50 million speakers.
Words on paper are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This applies mainly to addresses, which are often difficult to express well.
In many countries, the entire population speaks English, and in even more countries you can expect a limited knowledge of English, especially among younger generations.
Imagine a person from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica and Sydney having dinner together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They tell each other stories about their place of birth, told in their distinctive accents and local jargon.
Buying food in the supermarket is probably the cheapest way to get to food. However, without the possibility of cooking, the possibilities are limited to ready-made meals.
More and more supermarkets expand their range of ready-made food. Some even have a microwave or other device to warm up the food on the spot.
In some countries or certain shops you will find at least one restaurant. Often it has an informal atmosphere and you can eat cheaply there.
Make a copy of your policy and your insurer's contact details and keep them with you.
This should include the insurer's e-mail addresses and international phone numbers for advice/authorisation and the filing of claims.
Make sure you have another copy in your luggage and online (send yourself an email with attachment, or save it into the cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, it is convenient to keep a copy of the memory or disk (where it is accessible without the Internet).
Provide the travel organizations, but also friends and family at home who want to help, with a copy of your insurance details.
Elandes are normally not aggressive, but can defend themselves if they feel threatened.
If you don't think you're in danger at an eland, you can get too close and it can just go wrong.
Drink alcohol with measure. Alcohol affects everyone in a different way and it is important to know your own limits.
In the long term, excessive drinking can lead to health problems such as liver damage and even blindness or death. The use of illegally produced alcohol carries an even higher risk.
Illegal strong drinks can contain various dangerous impurities, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small quantities.
It is possible that glasses are cheaper abroad, especially in countries with low incomes and lower labour costs.
Imagine having an eye test done at home, which is also compensated by the insurance, and then submitting it somewhere else.
There are two problems with expensive brand mounts available at such locations: some are replica mounts and the real copies are more expensive than they are at home.
Coffee is one of the most traded products worldwide. You will probably find many different types of coffee in your own region as well.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways of drinking coffee worldwide that are worth trying.
Canyoning (or: caynoneing) means that you go to the bottom of a gap that is dry or full of water.
During canyoning, elements of swimming, climbing and jumping are combined. You need relatively little training or physical condition to start with (as compared to mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing for example).
Walking is an external activity where you walk in a natural environment, usually on hiking trails.
A day walk may consist of a walk from less than a mile to longer walks that can be walked in one day.
A day's walk along an easy route requires few preparations and everyone with an average condition can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need to prepare more, but a day in the outdoor air is perfectly possible, even with babies and children.
Around the world there are almost 200 running tour organisations, most of them independent.
Go Running, the successor to the Global Running Tours, consists of a network of dozens of 'sight running' providers spread across four continents.
It began in the Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen (Kopenhagen), followed by, among others, Running Tours Prague (Prague).
There are many things you need to think about before and when you travel somewhere.
Don't expect things to be 'just like home' when you're traveling. Ways, rules, food, traffic, your stay, use and language - it'll all be a bit different than you're used to.
You should always keep this in mind to avoid disappointments or even aversion to local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. You can ask a travel agency for help when you are going to make a type of trip that you have no experience with nature, culture, language or when you are going to low-income countries.
Most agencies accept the most common bookings, but many agents specialize in certain types of travel, budgets or destinations.
It may be better to use a travel agent who more often book travel that looks like you.
Look at which travel agent promotes, on a website or in the establishment.
If you want to travel around the world without spending much money, either because of need or because of your lifestyle or a challenge, there are a few ways to do this.
In principle, they fall into two categories: work while travelling or trying to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the last one.
If you are willing to offer comfort, time and predictability to keep spending as low as possible, look at travel with a minimum budget.
It goes without saying that tourists do not commit crimes such as stealing, illegally entering the black market, begging or otherwise exploiting people.
An immigration point is usually the first stop when you leave a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some international trains, train inspections are carried out on the road and you must have a valid identity card with you.
On some night train trips, the driver collects the passports so you can stay asleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you must report your presence and residence address to the local authorities.
To do this, you may need to fill out a form with the local police or go to an immigration office.
In many countries with such legislation, local hotels regulate registration (ask here).
In all other cases, only those staying outside the tourist accommodation have to register, but this makes the legislation a bit vague, so ask for it in advance.
Architecture revolves around the design and construction of buildings. Tourists often come from architecture alone.
Many buildings are pretty to see and the view from a high building or a well placed window can be beautiful.
In many ways, architecture overlaps with other areas, including planology, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many of the pueblo's are hugely remote, so you won't find a lot of nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Nevertheless, drinks are served in almost all of the casinos mentioned above. Some casinos even offer brand entertainment (especially the big casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Please note: for visitors from another state it is not always wise to visit the bars in the villages.
For example, in northern New Mexico there are major problems with driving under influence. The concentration of drunk drivers is highest near bars in villages.
Unwanted murals or crabs are also called graffiti.
Although it is certainly not a modern phenomenon, it is usually associated with young people who have public and private property covered with spray paint.
There are now also established graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls. As a result, graffiti paintings often look more like works of art than unreadable scratches.
Many tourists want to learn the popular tree varieties.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back, you need to make sure you have a suitable return boomerang.
Most boomerangs available in Australia, do not even fly back. It is best for beginners not to try to throw in windy
A Hangi meal is prepared in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones from the fire or there are places where geothermal heat naturally warms the ground.
The hammock is used to prepare a traditionally roasted meal.
Geothermic hangi is offered in several places in Rotorua. Other forms of hangi can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and other places.
MetroRail offers two classes in the Cape Town forensics: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less busy, but more expensive, although still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
On each train there are both Metro and MetroPlus cars, the last of which is always at the end of the train which is closest to Cape Town.
Transport for others: Never lose sight of your suitcases, especially when travelling internationally.
It may happen that you're being used as a drug smuggler without getting through it yourself, so you're getting into a lot of trouble.
Below is also the waiting in the row, as drug dogs can be used at any time without prior notice.
In some countries extremely severe penalties apply, even to the first criminal offence, which may include prison sentences of more than 10 years or even the death penalty.
If you leave your bags out of control, you can become victims of theft and, in addition, they can notice the authorities that are afraid of bombing threats.
The chance is that you are already immune to these bacteria at home due to the constant exposure to local germs.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you're running a lot more risk.
In addition, bacteria grow faster in warmer climates and can survive longer outside the body.
And so you get to deal with a 'Delhi Belly', the curse of the Pharaoh, the revenge of Montezuma or one of the other nicknames of the disease.
Just as many people suffer from breathing problems in colder climates, people in warm climates have more intestinal problems. In most cases this is very disturbing, but not very dangerous.
Always take into account the potentially large cultural differences when travelling for the first time to a third world country, or somewhere in the world you haven't been before.
Traveling to an unknown developing country can easily become overwhelming due to all the small cultural differences that quickly accumulate.
It can be wise to make use of hotels, food and services in the Western style, especially at the beginning, until you are acclimatized.
Be aware of the local fauna before sleeping on a mattress or mat on the ground.
If you are going camping, you should bring a camping bed or hammock, so that there are no snakes, scorpions and such near you.
Fill your house in the morning with the rich smell of coffee and evening with relaxing chamille tea.
During a stay, you have the time to spoil yourself and prepare something special.
If you're in an adventurous mood, take the chance to press or mix smoothies:
Perhaps you will discover a simple drink that you can make as breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, you can go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods where you don't often come.
For those who have little knowledge of medical jargon: there is a difference between the English words 'infectious' and 'contagious'.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, mold or other parasite.
A disease is infectious when it can easily be transferred to someone else near the infected person.
Many governments demand that visitors entering their country or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against different diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the countries that have previously visited or are still going to visit the traveller.
One of Charlotte's strengths in North Carolina is that there are tremendously many and high quality opportunities for families.
Residents from other areas often call family kindness an important reason to move there and visitors with children can often enjoy themselves well in the city.
Over the last 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in Charlotte's centre has grown explosively.
Families in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, but in some cases they can be convenient.
A surcharge is charged for more than 2 passengers, making this option unnecessary.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest place in the world.
Tourist visits are expensive, require a good physical condition, are only possible in the summer (November to February) and are limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, a few thousand employees live here at about fifty bases, mainly in these areas. Only a small number of employees winter there too.
The Antarctic interior consists of a bare plain under a layer of ice of 2-3 km thick.
A single time special flights continue into the interior, mainly for mountain climbing or to go to the pool where a large base is located.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a route which is 1600 km long and runs from the McMurdo base station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with splits filled up and marked with flags. You can only drive here with specialized tractors and sleds with fuel and stocks.
These are not very friendly, so the hiking route runs with a big detour around the Transantarctic Mountain to get to the plateau.
In winter, smooth roads, sidewalks and especially stairs cause most accidents.
At least you should have shoes with good soles. With summer shoes ice and snow is often very smooth. Some winter shoes are not even good enough here.
It shall be a cartridge with a minimum depth of 5 mm (1/5 inches) and, if it is cold, the material shall remain soft enough.
There are also models with nodules and special accessories are available when it is glibbery: fit most boots and boots, on the heels and/or the sole.
You should have heels that are low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or paths to get more grip.
avalanches are not a strange phenomenon; steep slopes can be a certain amount of snow and the excess snow comes down in a avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky. Something is needed to bring it down and the snow coming down can carry the rest of the snow.
Sometimes the original cause is the snow heated by the sun, sometimes it comes from more snowfall and sometimes from other natural events, but often there is a human cause.
A tornado consists of a very low pressure round air counter, which pulls the outside air inwards and upwards.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/h) and can lift heavy objects in the air that are carried when the tornado moves.
First, they come down from storm clouds as air-cookers, and once on the ground they're called "tornados."
Providers of a personal VPN (virtual private network) offer a good way to avoid political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
For a few reasons, they are better than web proxy: instead of just http, they direct all Internet traffic.
Normally, they offer a higher bandwidth and better quality service. They are encrypted, making it harder to monitor them.
Media companies regularly lie about this goal and say they want to prevent piracy.
In fact, regional codes have no effect on making illegal copies; a bit-by-bit copy of a DVD will do it as well on all devices as the original copy.
The real aim is for such companies to have more control over their markets, because money has to play a role.
Since calls are cancelled via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company that is located where you live or where you go.
You also do not have to ask for a local number at the municipality where you live; you can use, for example, a satellite Internet connection in the game of Chicken in Alaska and choose a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
Often you have to buy an international number separately, so you can be called by PSTN phones. Where the number is registered, it is important for the people who call you.
Real-time translation apps: applications capable of automatically translating entire segments of a text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate texts on signs or other objects into other languages when the user is or keeps his or her smartphone in front of the object.
Translation machines are greatly improved and now provide more or less correct translations (and less often Wart language), although some care needs to be taken because it is still possible that they have it at the wrong end.
In this category is one of the most prominent apps Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline if you have downloaded the desired language data.
When you're not in your own country, GPS navigation apps on your smartphone are the easiest and most convenient way to find your way out.
You save money because you don't have to buy new cards or buy a loose GPS device or rent a car from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or if it's up, it doesn't work or only limited.
Each neighborhood store is filled with a confusing range of prepaid phone cards that can be used in telephone cells or for regular phones.
Although you can call anywhere with almost all the cards, some providers are specialized in offering favorable call rates for certain groups or countries.
These services are usually available via a free phone number that can be accessed free of charge from many phones.
Rules for regular photography also apply to video recordings. Perhaps these rules apply even more to this.
If it's forbidden to take a picture, you don't have to make a video of it at all.
When using a drone, you must check in advance what you may film and what permissions and additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone over an airport or crowd is almost always a bad idea, even when it's not prohibited in your area.
Today, prices are almost always compared for the book, rather than directly with the airline.
It sometimes happens that you pay totally different prices for the same flight at different airlines and it may be worth comparing the search results for the booking and also looking at the airline's website itself.
Although you do not need a visa for a short tour or business visit to certain countries, as a student you often stay longer than a normal tourist.
Generally speaking, you must apply for a visa in advance if you want to stay abroad for a long time.
Student visas are generally subject to requirements and application procedures other than for ordinary tourist and business visas.
In many countries, the desired research institute must provide you with an offer letter and demonstrate that you have sufficient funding for the first year of study.
Ask the institution if the immigration department of the country where you want to go to study for more details about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, if you work abroad, you usually have to submit income tax in the country where you are based.
In each country, income tax is structured differently, allowing for a wide variety of tax rates and scales per country.
In some federal countries, including the US and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local levels, which may result in very different rates and discs between regions.
Although there is normally no immigration control or it is only a formality when you arrive in your home country, customs control can be a real thing.
Make sure you know what you may or may not enter and declare everything that goes beyond the legal limits.
A good first step in the world of travel reports is writing for an existing travel blog website.
If you know how to create and edit on the Internet, you can later create your own website.
You can really make a difference if you do volunteering while traveling, but it's not just about giving.
If you want to get to know a new culture, make new contacts and develop yourself, actually living in another country and doing volunteering is a good option.
It can also be a good way to reach out to your budget and stay somewhere longer, as a lot of volunteering offers a room and food and some you even offer a small salary.
The Norwegians reached the Black Sea and Caspian Sea via waterways in Russia. Part of this route is still usable. You may need a hard-to-reach special permit.
The White Sea Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean mainly through rivers and lakes with the Baltic Sea via the Onegame, Ladogame and St. Petersburg.
The Onegame is also connected to the Wolga, so it is still possible to go through Russia via the Caspian Sea.
Once in the marinas everything points to itself. Here you will find other boatlifters that will inform you.
In fact, you hang up your letters offering help, polar bear you through the harbour, step on people to ask if you can clean their yacht, try to make contact with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to chat with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will recognize you and give you tips about which ship is looking for someone.
Think carefully when you make your choice for a Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance.
Although you may think that you can best connect with an airline that you use most, you should be aware that the benefits offered are often different and that one airline can be more generous with frequent flyer points than the other, even if they are in the same alliance.
Airlines Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates significantly increase the number of flights to the African continent and fly at higher prices than European airlines to many major destinations in Africa.
Turkish Airlines has flown to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you still have time to spend on your trip, you can see how your total price statement for Africa compares with a price statement for a world trip.
Don't forget the extra costs of extra visas, departure tax, land transport, etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world on the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited by a lack of transocean flights.
There is no air alliance that provides for all three ocean crossings on the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not provide for any crossings).
Everything with the exception of the eastern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti is part of Star Alliance. This is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
You can't just cross the Pacific Ocean and the west coast of South America with this flight. (see below)
The Armenian ethnic region Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijani people in 1994.
A new republic was set up with the help of the Armenians, but there is no recognised nation (not even Armenia) which officially recognises this state.
Diplomatic disagreements over the area remain an obstacle in the relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The canal belt is the famous 17th century district around Amsterdam's inner city.
The entire area is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List because of its unique cultural and historical value. House prices are nowhere else high in the country.
Cinque Terre, or Five Lands, consists of five coastal villages named Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in Liguria, an Italian region.
UNESCO has included them in the World Heritage List.
In recent centuries, terraces have been carefully built, from the rough, steep landscape to the cliffs that look out at the sea.
Part of the charm comes from the fact that there is hardly any company development to see. Paths, trains and boats are used to connect the villages with each other and cars from outside the villages have no access.
The different forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ somewhat from French spoken in France, although they seem to be sufficiently consistent to be understandable to both parties.
In particular, the numbering system in the French-speaking part of Belgium and Switzerland contains some details which differ from the French used in France and a few words are spoken differently.
However, all French speaking Belgians and Swissers would have learned the Standard French at school so that they could understand you, even if you were using the Standard French numbering system.
In many places in the world swinging means a friendly greeting.
In Malaysia, at least in rural areas, however, it means 'come along', similar to a bent index finger directed towards the body, a gesture used in certain Western countries, and should only be used in this way.
A British traveller in Spain can wave in a similar way to say hello, where the palm is directed towards the tail (instead of the person to whom it is towed), looking for the gesture to come back.
Support languages are artificial or composite languages designed to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua francas. Lingua francas are languages that have been created in a natural or organic way and for whatever reason the dominant form of communication has become between people with other mother tongues.
At the hottest moment of the day, travellers can see air reflections, which make them think of seeing water (or other objects).
If the traveller moves towards the air reflection, this can be dangerous because of the use of precious energy and the remaining water.
At night it can also become particularly cool in very hot deserts. The risk of getting cold is significant if you do not wear clothing that keeps you warm.
When walking through the rainforest, you have to watch out for mosquitoes in the summer.
If you drive through the subtropical rain forest, you only need to keep the doors open for a few seconds as you step in and the mosquitoes are already in your car.
Both birds may already be infected with the bird flu.
Less than a thousand cases were observed in humans; in some cases this was fatal.
People working with poultry are most often involved in these cases, but birds are also at risk.
Characteristic of Norway are steep fjords and valleys followed by almost equal highlands
These plains are also called 'wide', i.e. a vast space without trees or boundaries.
In Rogaland and Agder they are generally called 'hei'. This confesses that it is a treeless heath that is covered with heath.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow downwards from the mountain. This ensures cracks and cracks that can be covered by snow.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can be collapsed and clogged.
At the edge of the glaciers large ice blocks break loose, which fall down and can ketch or roll over the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks in the late summer.
However, in winters they have a different but equally charming beauty. Many mountain resorts get a lot of snow, so you can ski and snowboard.
Only a few airlines still offer mourning rates, which reduces the cost of last minute funeral trips.
These are available from airlines such as WestJet, Air Canada, Delta Air Lines and, for a flight from the USA or Canada, Lufthansa.
In any case, you book by phone with the airline.
