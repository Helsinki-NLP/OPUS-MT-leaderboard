28-year-old chef was found dead in San Francisco Shopping Centre
Just moved to San Francisco's 28-year-old chef was found dead in the local shopping mall's stairs this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he does not know anyone who wanted to hurt him, saying, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia, a San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a life penalty and that the investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as the Sanfranciscoian Sons & Daughters restaurant's lineman six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "frightened and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close family, and they're going to miss him so much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was sleeping at the beginning in the hospitables, but that recently "he was finally doing well."
"He found the apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was good-willed, and he had a great heart.
His way of feeling together with the family was to make us food, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of argument.
He was a brother driving with the power.
"In the world where so many things are wrong, he was a non-greasy diamond, which shined brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-4444.
Doctors on strike: Requirements for new work-related measures
Doctors representatives have asked their trade unions to adopt new work-related measures in their dispute over a new agreement.
The Committee of Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the whole Council to support new work-related measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
In his letter to Members, which was published on Thursday evening via Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained “seven-sidedly silent” issues that led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to be authorised for the progressive and expanding work-force programme beginning early in September.
It follows from the dispute that medical practitioners have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete job experience in the history of the NHS health care system.
The leader of BMA medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the agreement, as recommended by BMA.
He had told the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be accepted before the vote of 54,000 doctors and students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be passed on to the English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, who ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the Russian and Turkish leaders met each other and declared the fight against eight months of economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Peter’s Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, the occasion was over.
But Putin's smile looked like a forceful man, and he didn't very much threaten heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I went crazy in the bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behaviour as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his passion was a reflection of the opposite.
But the cooling of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.
The Moscow reaction at that time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara because he stabbed Moscow in the back.
The injury was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state - controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious of these were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He's denied this so much.
But in Peter the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of a hard truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in the failed coup of last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by continued terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables after the new import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed.
"Turn there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti-sanomalemeh report formulated.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Hardly anyone is angry with the West as to what is considered a weak answer to the attempted coup.
When it is added to the long-lasting period of time in the run-up to the negotiations for EU membership, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool and to break Turkey's ties to the West, emerges.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the Prama seaports allowed Russia and Turkey to have a "external association", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experience the Western countries abandoning them and treating them wrongly, combining their powers.
However, these two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself with the role of peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that, after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question with regard to their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement as to where to look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster as NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are even on the record again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank's strategies have used the "RBS" brand today to protect other consumer finance brands.
It supported millions of international sports sponsors using the Reds of the Six Nations Rugby of Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let national brands come to the front.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
All RBS references except the main office and stock exchange lists in England and Wales are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use with customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS will become our brand of investors and our employees, because we will now become a much more branded bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards a branded bank, because basically (we have been asking questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on customers' needs, not on our own, I believe that you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those fires back, so I think time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins in Newmarket with Predlection and achieves 3000 wins
The dettor sprays champagne after he has won a total of 3000
The competitor Frankie Dettor secured his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone in his second win in his home race with John Gosden’s training at Predlection.
45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggotti, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time Master Jockey Dettor, who previously won the Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The detector sucks himself into cheers when he shows off Predlection after victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle contests... master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 wins in his pronunciation career.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of today’s age, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical genius separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode with a 6,000 winner if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding with winners in Great Britain for the most part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is good for British competition, but besides that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the saddle of flying landings from a pedestal to a trademark.
From the fly-off to the fly-off landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of the British competitive battle for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
His famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996 was won by a large race, but he also survived an aircraft accident and suffered from a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard start when he returned after a six - month ban on competition, but he showed considerable strength in character when challenging the suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may still continue for a long time - The Dettor has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin Distinguished Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has surprisingly separated Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted interior for many years.
63 years old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "described Ivanov's move away from the duties of the leader of the Russian presidential administration", but there was no reason to do so.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the esteemed Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later on, he led the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave and recommended that Persecut be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As head of department, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the end of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once promoted as a potential candidate for President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with real suspicion.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website to Putin Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex task, I could even say for my work.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, after Putin was head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second period of Putin, because Putin's third period would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got the shoe after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in the physical dispute last month at a series site in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their resignation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before he was notified of his dismissal.
There were creative differences and disputes at the site of the description.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how to remove Gibson's character from a series of FBI agents can be expected later.
The 54-year-old who has previously been a target for the Dharma & Greg media has been on the series since its first half of 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it all for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be with you all the time, but it's not possible right now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth production period of the series has been planned for 28 September.
Mysterious fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a waterfowl.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two inches of fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The GBP 1,35 billion project is expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have combined the northern deck of Queensferry crossing with the shoreline, which means that the bridge is now extending to Fife.
It is the first of four fuses between the "cover belts" which are now preparing the bridge around each three pillars.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 raisins.
The GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be ready by May 2017.
Secretary of Economy Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all proving a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closure of the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which the extreme dimensions must be reconciled.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck's concrete is being rolled in Rosyth today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first lock on any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
When the last section of the road was installed and combined with the extension to the north side of the road, we had to close off the remaining section to the north, i.e., to the interior.
This was done by drawing the north side of the road to 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
The vast, with a length of 222 meters, weighs about 6000 tons and was to be drawn at an angle of about 3%.
The requirement, because the allowed deviations, according to which the team was working, were tiny, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Fortunately, though, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat made an alarm on Friday at 1.20 p.m. (BST) after the crew saw the event developing in the Moelfre Bay Gulf.
Three men desperately tried to swim for safety while they continued on to themselves.
"We saw a boat moving closer to the men, and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, rudder of the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Happy luck the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging out on a boy without a lifeline.
The men were taken into the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had a dead end, but it had somehow disconnected it from the person who was there when the boat fell.
Someone's taking care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their leisure time watching evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and take part in some activity.
The screening time was initially limited to television, then to video games and now recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, we refer to the game called Pokémon Go. The application is based on characters that were developed in the early 1990s in video games (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game’s publication in other countries was delayed, as the huge popularity overburdened the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that are tracked by GPS and that can be "photographed" (with the help of a phone screenshot) or "push".
A generation who played the game at a younger age have joined the wildness and jumped up the couch along with the searches.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average tax person".
The Apple Watch Cardiogram application, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in the following users.
The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns have called for "to find 30", "to get up on the couch" and "to be active every day" and produced no results because most public health warnings are boring and pass on people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Regularly mobile people are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to read here.
The beauty of Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get to hunt new friends.
As usual, abominable joyists are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk around the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though there were previously applications like Fitbit that could be monitored for activity, they did not give reason for moving in the same way as this game.
The new charm disappears and the use decreases in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world will help many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Bales caught gold in women's powering diversification
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the crowd.
Simone Bales is immune to all that.
Energy jumps.
It's cool on the trees.
I can't believe it.
Excellent everywhere.
And now, eventually, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American amphitheatre reached the game’s championship on Thursday, highlighting the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
He had a total score of 62,198, clearly better than the silver medalist and the final five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Blackfina.
At the US Simone Biles Balance Party, the women's platform power diversification in the finals of the 2016 Brazilian summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The ball became the fourth American woman who has successively won the championship of diversification, and a total of five American champions. At the same time, she strengthened her reputation for his generation, and perhaps all the time, as the best.
He came to tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement will raise his class to the same level with the best athletes of other generations, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised his species to a new level:
The last three years of his race have been under the rule of the Bales, winning 15 world championships, including 10 golds, with a mixture of ambition and precision so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best powerman I've ever seen."
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between the burden of his and the burden of the excellency of expectations.
Back home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
The U.S. Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisma, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finals of the women's wheeled game in the finals of the 2016 Brazilian summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, elok.
On Tuesday, Bales reached the first medal when he was at the departure party of the top-ranking national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Bales claimed that he has never thought of the future as he walked long enough, I know it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program, which includes his brand's volt radiation, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would be beautifully suited also to the street next to the Olympic arena in Rio.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, whom her grandparents adopted as a midwife, and coach Aimee Boorman's mother found at the study room where Boorman was trained, has become a force.
He hasn't lost in the diversity since the summer of 2013, and this winning line will continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Blackfina was in a small position after two rounds, it was just a illusion.
The balance boom and permanto, where Bales is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top of the boom points 15,433 and exceeded them by getting 15,933 perm.
Raisman hugged him with kindness when they waited for the endpoints - just formality - and the tears rose to Bales' glittery red, white and blue-lined eyes when the dream from which he once wrote his score book came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of a prop from four years ago when he was in third place, but he lost the bronze to Blackfina in renewal.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "son of a bitch," was clearly in charge.
He sent air passes to the public after his permantial performance a return in an emotional shock, which at one time seemed questionable.
As far as the party is concerned, this wide-ranging tweet of 19-year-olds from this week will have a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died in the most fatal attack on Phoenix’s first serial killer case in the past decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The press release reports that the shooter standing on the side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled by another vehicle.
According to the police, a triple murder does not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take his purses or the other adult victim had $2,900.
Phoenix Police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that the shooting caused the researchers to examine whether it was connected to the four previous attacks.
All in all, seven people have died and two wounded in the nine attacks during four months, which have been carried out in two mainly Latin American cities.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as brown in the late 1990s, black in the late 1990s and white in Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and are by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, had to go to a hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died on the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report, which took place only half an hour before the third death and was aimed at the empty open van, which is believed to have also been the work of a serial killer.
The scientists found bullet shells, bullet seats, and bullet fragments in the engine mode.
Mother of the 6-year-old microcephalic: "It's getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six years old, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, and this is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not at all true - of course I promised," he said.
To him and his husband, Vincent, it was told that Edmund would not necessarily ever learn to identify them, and that he would not necessarily even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in hospital.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows me how the pointless people invented by Edmund are saying "can you sing to me"?
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language, he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own unintelligibles.
Microcephaly may be due to a variety of reasons: genetics, such as Edmund, or infections of the virus during pregnancy, such as carob or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't really know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give it to me.
But Picciuto has hopeful counsel for mothers whose babies are born with Zika.
It's gonna make things easier.
You can believe that the situation is getting easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The earthquake and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
The severe and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores causing extreme rain.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that aid is already coming to the districts that need it.
The governor's security and emergency bureau, Mike Steele, said that they were receiving requests for liftage of vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangiphaho County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
Up until Saturday, the flood light is in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The Weather Service said in the opinion that more rain is expected in the area from three to five cents.
On Friday, when rain continued in the Mobile area, the floodlight in southern Alabama was in force.
The Baton Rouge River, near the flowing Committee River and the flowing Amite River near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set the flood peak during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there was a lower risk of the flood of the region of Ascension along the river, when the rivers flow slowly down Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows southwards the state border with Mississippi in Lousiana Liverpool, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still picking up people from the floodwater in the Amit and Wilkinson districts in the south of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and grandson were on Friday near Gloster.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another boy who lived close by.
"We grew, and the water just went up," Hansford said.
It stretched all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the stream of water so high during the 48 years that she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all the injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the triangle in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods are "quickly spreading" to vast areas as severe rain continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely fed up with the severe rain since the middle of the week.
The earthquake and the flood of the streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipaho from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reports that a member of the City Council in Tangipaho said that 200 homes had been flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The president of the congregation, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets that had remained on the rise water.
The shelters for those who have been evacuated have been opened to the cities of Amit and Hammond.
"They'll get back to their homes when the water starts to fall," she said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangipaho, about ten streets were closed because of rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sand bags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were told with their flood, but so far there have been no reports of a flood on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods business in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and rain continues."
"Full bullets" were six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive the Philadelphia shooting
The police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name is Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had several bullet wounds, including joints, feet, hands, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his small body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgery has been performed on him.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class in local high school.
Brown was one of four shot people in the block of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot from the front seat of the car in conjunction with the 29-year-old in critical condition, status reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a cross between several shooters.
The shell types of the attack weapon, which originate from various assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
The street had casings on both sides of the corridor.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Anthony Ginaldi, Philadelphia's chief of police, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating the tapes of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, girl, had a delusional hand hit on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is why I call this year's Women's Olympic Strength Team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three powermen, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, is all proud.
This team looks, finally, American.
It has also established the involvement of dark and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female powerman has been Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is awesome.
In the last Olympics Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible achievements of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterful powering programs.
On Thursday Simone became a fourth American woman who has successively won the individual gold in women’s multiple games.
And the teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in the gymnasium across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic team.
They're "Final Five" (the last five), because the next Olympics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that the power generation is expensive, and the power generationists practice mainly in private power generation clubs maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competitive fees, hotel fees (trainers and their power generation as well as families) and the list continues.
A large part of these powering clubs are in wealthy pre-urban relief areas that can support species.
These clubs give powermen all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to the families of powermen.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Bales' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both trained their athletes since they started powering.
We should bring more affordable and available power training to communities where many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I set up my power plant 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable reinforcements in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (home city) to offer high-level amplification to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
The amplifiers develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work performance.
This team's inspiration will make thousands of young girls get on with the gymnasium, and it's awesome.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're going to have an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for seriously demonstrating the "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctors organizing new strikes after abandoning Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37 000 medical practitioners who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to enforce the agreement, saying that NHS was "on unknown soil", and that even minor delays harm staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement that will include changes to night and weekend working practices to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Trainers Committee, said in the opinion: "The doctors still have serious concerns with the proposed agreement, in particular that it is accelerating the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's companies have encountered a lack of willingness on the part of the government to participate and, at times, a deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt should work now, remove the penalty and take into account the concerns of the medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners are ready to continue working.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the suspension of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception hours when nurses and doctors consulted were recruited to serve as the doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend for 54,000 medical practitioners.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers' Association, appealed to medical practitioners not to go to strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles are achieved very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already demanding teams and services, as well as causing concern, anxiety and disturbances to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been discussing with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, educational flexibility, further training returning from the Sabbath stage, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, free study and gender pay differences in medicine - will mark the seriousness of the compliance of employers, the Health Education England training organisation and the Ministry of Health with the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day of paying medicine after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
Catagrelor, a medicine that prevents blood clotting, lowers the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
For 12 months after a heart attack, the medicine is given to reduce the risk of stroke or a second seizure.
NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and one quarter of them get a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the fatty material accumulated in the artery wall, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can go with the blood and break the bloodstream to the brain causing the stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective prevention treatments, even one quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for several thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor have been limited over more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness allows election violence to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving an impetus to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that the widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities has been ignored, which is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, the former Minister of Government, imposes on the police, election officers and city councillors the fact that they have ignored the evidence of the election because of the "oversensitiveness of race and religion".
The former secretary of the Community, the current emperor of corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put chains of guard to protect those who are afraid of voting.
He recommended that voters should submit an identity card by voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests that the finger of a person who votes should be placed on an undisturbed ink so that no one can vote twice.
They should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He called for greater access by the press to the documents and decisions of the informal committees or working party.
"This would not only protect against election violence, but it would protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud, which goes hand in hand with election violence," he said.
The government ordered a report as a result of the election scandal of Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality.
The Court stated Rahman's "quietly distorting" religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote on him.
Even 300 votes were suspicious or the result of a person voting in another person's performance.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the plains all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the election by election mail, in which members of the high-ranking Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning up of the voting system, including proof of identity by means of an identity certificate.
He states in his report: "The evidence was presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were being pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There was concern that...the state institutions had ignored such conduct because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to race and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, one of which was to deny political activists the right to deal with voting flags by mail in order to end the "gathering of votes".
The report examined by Theresa May also calls for more stringent amendments to the registration system in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Examine options for proving voters' identity before voting.
Use the finger of an undisturbed black person so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for an automatic mail vote.
Disable political activists from dealing with the voices and envelopes of the ready mail in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for fear on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make a photo at polling stations illegal.
Require that only English is used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Confirm training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that voters should go to the top alone.
Sir Eric shares the police forces in Greater London saying it's "astonishing" not to be charged with any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Court stayed behind Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
On numerous grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized the inefficient "cross-checks" in the city council registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the bearer of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral violence and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's biker twins and other famous images of the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone mixed up with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the most powerful twin creature in Cambridge's duke.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double being, at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio races and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has composed a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Forester and wolf: U.S. men's swinging team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin being found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to observe how a particular bow launch could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after rising to the surface of his pictures in which he seems scary the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when the social media became aware of the enthusiasm, the archery admitted that he had since childhood heard of his appearance as Leol.
"I don't see a big look, except maybe for a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely also emerge this year: an astounding equality between Britain's long jumpers Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Alya Blackfina, the largest Russian powerman with his obvious eyes, has been said to be a Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan's twin being.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger to change your eye: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actor's "sports version"
Another long-term comparison has been the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more the same actor as Annalynne McCordin than browned skin and light hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's Sports Version".
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, sharing a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of a pair
A Twitter user recently expressed on the site their happiness at "the other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jenings and his smile, which is almost identical to the actress Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile fits the star Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC's Olympic Comment after saying Chinese swimmer "dead as swine"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth, instead of the women's 4x200-metre free-way message, provoked the CBC's direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC should have apologized after one of its browsermen said during the race that a Chinese woman's 14-year-old "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 meter free-to-air message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC's explanatory team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch up with China.
Visitors across Canada quickly react online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'dead like a pig'??
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in a message final of women's free time 4 x 200 meters: "That little 14-year-old from China, baby."
Review of Byron's MacDonald on Twitter was rich and fast, many of them challenging him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard Byron MacDonald's disregard.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
Soon after that, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment in the live broadcast, saying, "We regret that the comment on the bathing performance was sent.
It was a sad choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times for those who had tweeted in response to the comment.
The reporter's colleague, Scott Russell, had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and sent an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and issued an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made, and that they were sent directly.
Last night we quickly took action and, in a live broadcast, we apologized to our viewers and to our followers in the social media.
For the sake of clarity it must be said that Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance, not as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about his message.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to determine his comment by saying that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"At this moment, I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who humbly matched underwear in the middle of the shop
Customers did not know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primaryk’s movement to try underwear.
Things did not improve because, after assessing what she looked like in her pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually agreed four underpants in the store, which was located at Bouverie Place's shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's store at Bouverie Place's shopping mall in Folkestone, where she arranged underwear and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children in the shop Jenny Davidson said that after experimenting with underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the shop without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of underpants, took off her own socks and underwear and put on her matching feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place in the settlement, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone stared when he took off his underwear again, and obviously he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t want anything to be seen, dressed up again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about a person who ended up buying underwear that he agreed on."
Davidson, 33-year-old, living in the city of Kent, said, "It is disgusting to think that someone will take the underwear that someone else has tried, but has not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is quite good."
"It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and took them off and they have not been washed."
Primer's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August in Folkestone's movement.
All those products have been removed from sale."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video of Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gun-wrapped robbers in the vicinity.
We were approached to you before or behind, this video shows you how to pay the attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "find the line of fire."
Then you grab a gun between the elbow and the shoulder before hitting the face with your elbow open.
Continue with your knee to your knees, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, turn the weapon from his hands, hit him with a gun on his face and stand back in the direction of the weapon.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender cannot fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun off his grip, pull back and point him on the gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video of how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's Grand Master, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveller has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's most dirty and nightly places.
A runner and travel writer, Ian Wright, 51 from Suffol, would lick euro banknotes, without pecking at Piccadilly Circus, the train's toilet flush button and Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before he was licking every object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment of a film called “Inside Power” produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train by thousands of people can seem totally repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On her way through Europe, Wright constantly talked to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and her own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him in the mouth of an evil taste.
Wright became a well - known intestinal endurance tester when traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from the public rail stations to the toilet flush button, really did test his immune system.
In the film, he said, "Since childhood, I've been quite carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from dirt, worms and curly water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample contained more than 4,000 units of photometric reading.
Because of the comparison, the reading of the counterwashed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public office, he did not want to lick when the photometric result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the counterwashed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, behind the inner power, together with the Finnish Maijer, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna do anything about it, 'cause it's a good night's sleep.
The internal force behind it was produced together with the Finnish dairyman, Valion.
The company offered Wright to Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the Committee for Intermediates, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and, at the same time, explain the advantages of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's go to Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell us about our everyday environment of good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film will help us to tell consumers more about it.
I also believe that the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The director of the document, Tom Hakala, added, "Let's say it this way, if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the Russian viper showing in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows."
In the survey in 2015, 84% of respondents specifically combined lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that they use at least products that have added lactic acid bacteria between them.
The family of the blinds destroyed the rental house at Cornwall in Saltash, before it was destroyed.
The family of the children of the deceased caused the damage of £50,000 to their rental house after they were evicted due to the terrorization of their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash after having been elected numerous times.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, the upset employees of the housing company found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls had been made of ammo, the floor panels were torn, the waste had been spread over the floor and the walls had been crushed with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Housing, said he's afraid he can't fix the property.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think that people should have to live in this way.
There is a lot to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is ungrateful, and their name is ungrateful."
The couple had three sons who lived between the properties, and according to the police, the family’s horror included street fighting with baseball bats, the intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, took a decision on non-social behaviour.
A lot of the rooms in the house that's under the cover of the dump were used to find old waste.
The property, which was previously used to pass drugs, was a mess up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were called on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing exclaimed strongly from the woman and her partner's property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily change.
Impressive neighbors thanked me, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbor for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen an unbelievably large number of police here.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here we haven't gotten used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall Housing, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
Squirrel and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct and family conduct, for the dismissal is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have shocked neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as by the courageous and informed members of the community.
I hope that this development will bring something comforting to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three sons all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the emergency, a dirty mattress left on the floor of a single bedroom
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the waste piles surrounding the house
In 2014, the police made the ride to the property and found over 70 g of cannabis as well as the balance, supplies and 1700 pounds cash.
Skeldon received fines for his guilt for holding a B-class drug as a intent to share it with others.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon’s tombstone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless after being frozen in a private apartment in Plymouth.
For many of the house's walls, graffiti had been destroyed.
The police say they're trying to evict residents who think they're mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that the discharge was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their conduct is without consequence, and for those who suffer such conduct," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social exploitation, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travelers to Portugal were terrified when a military jet flew down the shore with a grind.
Sun worshipers in Portugal Aveiro experienced a shock in their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft wiped away from the ground.
Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, terrified tourists began to panic when the low - flying jet wiped over the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came to a distance of almost touch from the sun worshippers on the sandband in northern Portugal Aveiro.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not begin to see what the clouds were heading for them.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of the dramatic passing of social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice at a very low level, and one point seemed to be falling into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing, and I really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew at an incredible low.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight with the aim of identifying fishing boats near the coast and that the plane was to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably below ground due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby terrestrial areas, but the air forces assured that no one was in danger of safety.
This summer, the country fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly because of the low visibility conditions, the smoke caused by the terrain and the heavy fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight and, as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Exotic first half result better than expected
In January - June, the Southern Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) produced a better planned result of EUR 3.4 million.
The ex-ante result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to break down institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will seek to shorten the number of lines of action.
The premium covers the past deficit by way of surplus.
The excess portion may be used to reduce queues and to buy measures in patients.
The overall result of the year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exoten Government will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border icers swore a military oath in Immola
Of the 70 officers of the Border and Marine Guard School, the military jury was sworn on Friday.
The military election of the shipowners of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special ice reserve course was held at the equipment sports field.
The military jury swore 70 of the shipmen.
Special border icers are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special ice cream.
250 of them were invited to the tests.
Since 2007, there have been training courses for special ice-creamers in Immola.
During the election, five veterans of the border forces participated in the veterans’ meeting.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans on the occasion were born in 1918.
Predeterminant delinquency - criminal intelligence helps to resolve crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police agencies has been the RTA, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlin are in the Hämeenlin Police Department.
It's drawn by Lahti's established sergeant.
Lieutenant Lahti is a cover manager.
In addition, the unit's strength includes the information technology dedicated to civilians in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian facility.
The Unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, according to Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the other police.
Among other things, it has obtained information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would be more and less likely to go to war until they get an alarm.
With the help of information collected and analysed by the Unit, daily police activity is targeted where it is most needed.
In the context of the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence unit was set up in the country, with less than three national units and each of their own criminal intelligence units.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is a national leader.
The PTR units work in accordance with the name of the people from the Police, Tull and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work according to the police departments in the divided areas and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
Where the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA mission is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of one’s own institution, as it does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better basic police skills.
By means of the registers, the alert database and the findings, the Unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, prolific criminal or similar crimes.
This is called "splitting", and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain type of image is formed.
An assignment can be made either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit are not able to move their necks in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
There is no mention of the methods used by criminals, either on their own or on their own, because this could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus to an attempt to prevent police law enforcement.
The method of the police will be publicly reported if it anticipates a threat to them.
This was the case, for example, with the early - summer news, the way of marking empty dwellings used in house breakage.
In it, the makers put a stick, a needle or a piece of tape on the outside of the apartment, which they tried to find out if the residents were really traveling.
The screening material shall be publicly available to at least the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from mistakes.
The nocturnal protocol of the district court, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found at the place.
The next time we steal, we'll leave the gloves with our hands.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppa from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that will allow them to plan their activities in practice.
Background for the reduction in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the institutions and Finnish borders.
A schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British girls who left last year from London to join Dad, is reported to have died in Syria.
Counselor Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl’s family heard this dead in Raqq, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in Russian air to Raqqa, which is the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just when he planned to escape the war from the country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and will to others that leaving the war zone involves real risks - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other eastern-lontanese schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they went by bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she only became a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton is a candidate for Garland's Supreme Court if he is elected
Senator Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic President candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senator Major Mitch McConnell says that the next president will elect a member of the Supreme Court of the late Antoni Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday at the phone conference that he predicts "with some degree of certainty" for Clinton to choose Garland.
The Reid representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "get a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hands" and "possibility."
He said Trump wasn't suitable for duty.
Treads says that the naked calendar is "for women as well as for men"
The Treads magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they intend to find the next top-class 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The Treads president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his paper, which contains plenty of naked pictures, differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We need to begin to introduce timeless and classical nakedness again in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these naked women's pictures," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Templates can leave images through the network or in personally open selection settings in Los Angeles and New York.
Destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill out a comment on the irritable insults of the author with a name mark NoAllOtherMale-age Men, you will notice that this claim is based on real knowledge.
According to YouGovi, the reappearance of much spoken records is not due to the fact that more and more of those born in this millennium are enthusiast by the novelty of physical objects, but by the moat of mid-life.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl disc are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely records are purchased from age group 18-24.
The question is not only about the collection of enthusiasts, but also about emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But do YouGovi's results match?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me when I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, over me a modest gray suit. I would boldly point out before stopping, make a cup of my hands and say something deserving, like, "Let's look at it more carefully."
Let's take a closer look at it.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies, are now filling up buildings that used to have independent movements - a handful of magnificent specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I'm very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgower Stuart, 55 whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and turns around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"Well, I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4000 records.
These records, which appear in the picture above (he sent the sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for buying such a huge volume of records and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and moneyless.
"The great part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my evil."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she meets fit the profile of YouGovi.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have become the need to buy their old records back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their CDs," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl alarms of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
The Phonica-like trade takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer comfort to similar-minded types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured in the immediate payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be puzzled by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; on objects that evoke the memories of teen happy days.
"I think that sometimes it can be about filling the gap or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it to be true to many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said, "from the top."
The April opinion poll carried out by the ICM revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought a vinyl disc in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% of the shoppers do not have a record player.
This is where the news report is likely to look like the pile of bo in nova collections in my seriously concerned browser.
This "reward" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in the Sounds of the Universe ( counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radio head record so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large part of it, but this is absolutely what is happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not older people, but younger people, my late ages, who are just getting excited about it.
In Fop, where today there is almost a whole layer reserved for vinyls, there is a much more versatile audience when I arrive.
Seven-ring couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements - the sound of the freshest of Wild Beast's latest scapegoat and sexy pop, and not the improvisation jazz - is great to see different customers.
None of them seem to be particularly lonely, but a bald psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes watching the various records sold.
He's making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so the record collection really isn't an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised the generation of new vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I'm trying to look at the shorts of jeans, I noticed a group of teenage girls collecting for a moment around Polaroid cameras before my father and daughter considered the purchase of Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, with any average collection of essential records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's purely "taid vinyls."
But given that the least attention given to these items can mean more money for the industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers to seek more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population more likely to have more time and money is also the one that uses the most luxury products, such as vinyls.
But although my findings suggest that YouGovi’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude the vast number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or in the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings painting around the record stores on Berwick Street and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old artificial TV drinker over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal in the world - video report
Researchers say that the Holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spine.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is in a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to terminate the trade in Jungle refugee camps
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application to unload tens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to unwind a total of 72 temporary shops where people sell cigarettes from inside the camp to energy drinks, provide hair cutting or sell tea with 50 cents (40 cents) or sell simple food with a few euro in temporary restaurants.
The Bureau of the Calais Prefect reasoned that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they represent a risk of fire and clean-up.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that 72 people who traded temporarily were not legal grounds, but said that Calais's prefect 'was completely understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people "in the most uncertain conditions".
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the guise was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe camp, which operates unprofitable and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum advisers for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafes.
The letter to Guardian said that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to the top - since the arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Box prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
In Finland, food falls sharply to the delight of consumers and to the shame of producers.
The price of wine in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, when the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are from the article published in the Tieto & Trends blog, published by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Journalinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
Food prices rose sharply in the early 2010s.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The import bans on food imposed by Russia now weigh the price, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-group and Kesko have both fallen their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been seen as an impressive advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a source of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a level of pay similar to Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the countries in question had the same rate of VAT they would be sold to the third lowest-priced countries in Finland.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT were in the seven countries in question, only German and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finnish.
"If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, we have to halve VAT to the average level of EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The press points out that his VAT percentage calculations are indicative.
The school's not exactly what it used to be anymore.
Returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic year in all sub-schools.
It is an instruction that all schools in Finland operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautification is abandoned, and instead schools are beginning to practice coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of pupils.
In the past, it was thought that the teacher would teach the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This way they try to make school more interesting.
The longest vertebrae in the world was found - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even ice sharks, known as Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), achieves reproductive maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live after another 250 years, report on a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest vertebrae in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it only bypasses an Icelandic pig whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507 years.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the biggest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch beyond dogs, they can grow to over five metres.
Due to the slow growth rate, the monitoring shows that only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been living with the highest number of people for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues made it clear.
He defined the age of 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon testing of eye lenses.
The average age of examined sharks was at least 272 years.
The sample’s two largest fish, 493 and 502-centimetre amazons, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, researchers have calculated that they are at that stage about 150 years of age.
The study was published in Science.
From Stockmann to almost 300 sellers are not deducted
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from the department store Stockmann.
At the beginning of August, the cooperative companies ended in difficulty.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be taken as redundancies", says Stockmann in his press release.
It states that the number of dealers in the goods sector will not be reduced in order to ensure that the customer service is not affected.
In addition, some 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
The Stockmann negotiations concerned some 3 000 workers.
At the beginning of these reductions, it was estimated that there were around 380 employees.
The people’s reduction aims at an annual cost saving of around EUR 20 million, which is to be implemented in the next year.
Mr Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme which aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background to this is Stockmann's difficulty in getting a profit from the department store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the retail trade continues to make losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann's CEO, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, personal adjustments are necessary to ensure the positive business result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", says Veijalainen in the newsletter.
In the second quarter, the result was particularly successful in the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved its best second quarter turnover and earnings.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was 4.1 million in loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees Fahrenheit
The centre of low pressure on the north of Finland will hold the weather on rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but the southerly part will be rough.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the north, rain zones remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes a doping scandal with a strange explanation for coach’s stroke
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent from the Rio Olympics home after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, who was in Kenya’s national team leadership, said that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after giving a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
The doping officials went to the authorities in Anzrah.
Soin says Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept that," says Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, "to the Reuters news agency.
Olympic general sports start on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run right away.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich finished last year in the World Cup in fourth place and is ahead of Rio's winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah went on an athlete accreditation card just to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed him to be an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of being exposed," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s general sports show is emptying
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, they're not watching public sports.
On Friday the struggle for the medals of general sport began in Rio, but the world’s leading individuals were able to show their skills to a confusing empty audience.
The Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first morning competition and 65% of the tickets for the evening competition have been sold.
Another four years ago, in London, where the stadium hurried a cheering crowd.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have attracted attention even before public sports.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the rugby, noise and riding seats.
When Brazilian medalists in Talita Antunes and Lar Franca played beach football in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the seats were full.
After the Brazilian war, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 were more full.
The bad way to go at least explains that Brazil is far away from Europeans and Asians in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilians who are used to football.
Indeed, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not be filled with the football stadium.
During the weekend, newscaster Mario Andrada said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left for sale," says Reuters, Andrada.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold by the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have changed from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
At the Olympic Games in London, volunteer workers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have issued 240 000 tickets for lesser-known species such as golf and rug.
In the morning, the Rio Stadium was full of empty places.
Not even a beach football ball on Copacaba's sand has any interest in the audience.
Jukka Mittesalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people on the press.
New way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by the latest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
After that, individuals, businesses and communities can make money available to pay for ownership rights in the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land has been virtually divided into blocks which are available to the interested parties against payment of the right of ownership.
The holder has a right of veto of a block of 187 square metres, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the intended use of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired in more areas.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be left as a inheritance or as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or tie yourself up somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviakangas, who acquired the right to manage his business.
Those who acquire the right to control will receive precise location information from their unit, which will enable, for example, a visit to the unit.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the owners of the rights appear on the same map on which the country block information can be found.
The spread fabric sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation Keeper project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land by either buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more countries of protection.
It also aims beyond the borders of Finland and plans to import from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Trade Square August 13-19.
Bike thieves are the worst tormenting cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment the largest cities in Finland.
There are more bikes stolen in relation to the number of inhabitants this year than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the reports to the police, the Helsinki Declarations explained to the police the volume of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, there were four out of five bicycle robberies per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle robberies per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double the number of thieves in relation to the number of residents," explains police inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why Turku has been stolen more bikes than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how much the wheels are at all," explains Sergeant Teemu Mähäs.
The police government's Tommi Reen thinks it's quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will be at the top of the comparison.
The amount of bicycle robbery goes largely to study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense center, short distances and a lot of wheels for the thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In January-August, the whole of Finland police record has become slightly less of a bicycle thief than in the corresponding period of last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police have reported a little over 20,000 bicycle robbery every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Mr. Reen calls on people to report theft of bicycles, even if fewer than every 10 cases reported to the police are detected.
Typically, theft of a bicycle is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"Conditions can also be found during other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case in the apartment," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in the context of a police investigation, says older officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle shops, inner courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically anywhere where they are usually kept.
Of the individual bicycle models, Jopää is most stolen as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the wheel for short term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels are sold online, for example.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police don't know that stolen wheels would go a lot abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are usually Finnish.
I'm sure some people will buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some people may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel should be careful, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or offence.
"Advertising bells should ring if good-looking wheels are sold at a clear lower price," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, always carries a colorful Nops for his working day in Helsinki for the protection of the Kallio Library.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says, "Never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves, there's not necessarily any hipster value here," Helsinki's Monster thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to lock his bike with a small U-lock in the Helsinki Kalli kiosk.
Now the bike is tucking the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bicycle rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone paid about EUR five hundred.
"It's time to hear from the guys that they've taken the wheels."
"Mostly bad wheels, such rock-hops."
One year ago, a bicycle was stolen from the big body of the house company.
Although the bike had not been locked up, Valve was able to wait for it to come by.
Under 15 years of age to be responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, a so - called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
The initial experiment will apply to children under 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
A peer jury is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a written letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, Director of the Youth Survey, says that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used alongside each other.
"Everyone steers a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model of the United States of America has been taken into account in its extensive use.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person will not be faced with the adult panel but will reflect on what happened with approximately the same age.
The model's been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all.
"It's been a message that you continue on the path you've chosen," says Lovio.
The Selection Board is part of the Migration Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stressed that new approaches were offered to all who needed it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published in the US Politico magazine, which had been given a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter has been addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee for Reince Priebus.
Signatories want the party's money to be diverted to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his carelessness, incompetence and record disadvantage, threaten to bring a sound ring to these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate orientation of all possible resources to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-adorned anchor on their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chance to win the presidential elections will decrease by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational characters of the letter is apparently Trumpi's opposing Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to the politicians, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority in Congress" and it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working with national security announced in an open letter that they will not support Donald Trumpe as President.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told me about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the American economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the centre of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme to improve U.S. infrastructure, roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by the high tax rates, in part by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-on-hand extension for American duneers who have suffered from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the people of the builders, we must return to the builders!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families in families with children.
On Thursday, though, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax haven, it's gonna have to pay the tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he had previously supported.
"[As President], I oppose all trade agreements that are against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published before Clinton's speech in The Washington Post, Clinton intended to criticize the Republicans Donald Trump's financial programme on Monday for "promising only this kind of millionaires".
Clinton has previously called Trump's "Trump" loopholes for corporate tax relief.
Thursday Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur herself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton tickled.
These are Rio's viewers: The races have not joined Finnish fans, but the mobile application is interesting.
The sports competitions are usually seen in television viewer statistics as sharp peaks in the mountains.
The Rio Olympics have not so far reached a peak of viewers.
At one time, the races have joined at their best 12% of the population: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic Channel TV2.
Because of the comparison, almost 800,000 viewers were given TV2 at a time for the one-month Euro-sports event, and the Euro-ball event was worth a fair second million.
For the time being, the Olympic genres have been most interested in cycling on Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, which both reached the Olympic Canal at a time with nearly half a million spectators.
The top sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the audience, and reminds us that the audience will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers in general choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, the viewers also share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports races Yle has owned for a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London or 2008 Beijing races, but the difference in time difference - a large part of Rio's race shows comes to night time in Finland.
Another reason to be paralyzed is surely the traditional Finnish reason - if someone considered it paralyzed now - for Finland: if Finland had taken a surprise medal for the first round, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, general sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest in Finland: sailing and horse riding.
The initial viewers have been close to expected according to the Pokkine.
When public sports start, the ratings will explode.
For the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first days of the races, the Apple App Store became a more expensive, free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd guess we're already gonna get 200 grand in the way.
"The network viewers will only receive us later." Pokkinen tells us.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been fixed.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with the delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
Rio Olympics will be seen in the Upper Channel and the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be tracked from Yle Fem Canal, and on the radio Yle Puhe delivers races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working for Ylle, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
Since 2018, there are Olympic sports on top and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres.
Maybe it's even deeper.
Technical instructor Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters at the Crossrow, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth in a hundred metres, says developer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvaswater (90 meters).
More than 80 metres extend to Saima, Touswasser and the Main Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Daylight.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the middle depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Day will not be reached among the ten deepest, and Suvaswasser is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12, at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes in the middle were wrong.
Ideas from the Tax Area: Pensioners' tax is still tighter
Pensioners' taxation is still more intense than wage earners.
The Ihaläinen says that the abuse occurred during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
In our view, that should be the case.
After the election, the promises made should be complied with, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary reductions were introduced to employees, which reduced taxation.
In the parliament, the matter was heated by opposition representatives who cut off Alexander Stubb, the then finance minister, from the electoral promises.
Buying power is secured, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that a tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's messages on the desire to respect the competitive agreement reached at a difficult time.
He says keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the Government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be called into question.
It comes in need, because the economy is so much on the back of domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Involved in long-term unemployment
He appealed to the government to address the long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was approximately 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% will be to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died in the bombings that took place in Finland's time.
The Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Thai Finnish tourists to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thailand travel period is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts at Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be good, says Westphalen.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet on the source of the attacks.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of Thai society and the recent referendum on the military junta constitution.
The law was adopted by referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who reported their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, in turn, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
In Bangkok today is a big, local celebration, Westphalen says.
She said the city was celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very accurate about safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, says Thai police according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourists' favourite in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination in Finland, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require the death penalty.
Two bombs exploded according to the magazine at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the magazine, one person was wounded.
In turn, the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin has exploded four bombs yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
There was at least one in both of them.
In addition, in southern Thailand, the village of Surat Than and the city of Trang exploded at least one bomb in both.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it transports Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao to the holiday islands.
Not known who committed the attacks
According to the leader of the Thai military junta, Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the author of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic any more, he told the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for security, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Thai Finns to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but caution should be followed by the great-grandfathers, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and the victims that took place during the night of Finland.
Last night's attack at Hua Hin has had a little more time to learn.
There, a local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded as a sighting near the bell tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where he thinks he's found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower counters according to the governor of the province.
The city worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN chief of police interviewed says that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded approximately half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Balles won the women's square
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second in 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina was third in 58.665 points.
Partys, 18, are still aiming for yard championships in the Rios with permann, jump and booms.
Partys have been controlling the empowerment of women to the mind for the last few years.
From three previous seasons, he won eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of square and permanno three times in a row, both last year and another year.
On the U.S. team, Balls has won two teams world championships.
The darkest MM medals on the ball have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Ice has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a children's play club based in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think there will be anything more amazing about this, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia, Huovila, who worked for about 20 years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these people haven't been banished by tourists before, I don't think so either.
Huovila's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said you should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the road songs had been put on because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movement was allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three days in Thailand time, the traffic in Patong had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men suitable for voice marks hidden in a nearby hexagon.
The other man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the use of the motor vehicle for theft, theft and serious damage.
The police would like to thank those who gave the clues.
Director of Research on Russia’s Director Changes: Clear Move Out
On Friday, Russia made a high-quality change in leadership over the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned the chief executive Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is an Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Perseo.
He's an ex-diplomat. He worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangasburo says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is the way to prevent people from gaining independent power from the president.
It is also possible, according to Kangasbruka, that Ivanov has been in contact with other managers or has been in a mess.
Station drop in Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's inner circle, is transferred to the specific tasks of the environment and transport.
With a tape from the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other missions and proposed Persecution to his place, said Russia Today.
Kangasburo says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in the position.
In Russia, environmental and transport matters are not very high.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia’s power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangasburo points out that the old chart, for example the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher Katri Pynnönem from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heirs of Ivanov's place is the fact that Putin changes his neighbor.
Daddy fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so as not to aim for them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manitoba Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jababulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish leaders gained around 90% of Dad’s city of importance.
It is estimated, however, that tens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Fixed previous news at 7:30 pm: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, and actually the ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Lawlessness of the Ministry of the Interior
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publication of documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Vooläinen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voidan says to STT that document disclosure cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister reasoned the decision on the basis of the Government Office's instructions and the fact that the information was entered in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic performance starts in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has been running against time under the prize contests.
He hurt his way back from the beginning and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic cards.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-weared sambatanzers and fanciers.
Porina Bolt is alluding to the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the age when public sports have struggled with doping scandals and the interest of skating.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he cut himself off in the early 200 meters from 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began on a hundred metres, breaking the record of the world and the end of the rivals’ confidence in him at the time of the 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career by the clock of his watch.
World premieres in Berlin at 9.58 on a hundred metres and 19.19 on two centuries are still in force.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 meters and an understatement of 19 seconds, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
The 100th Olympic winner, Justin Gatlin, is one of Bolt's most challenging.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in the finals of the prize contests if only he has made his way.
In Daeg in 2011, a hundred MM finals were left from Bolt without running due to a false departure.
Bolt fills in a week and a half after 30.
He's an old man of the young men's kind, and the Rios are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has put next year's World Cup in London for the final finish line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I am in the pool, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrate interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes are suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s national news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18, has submitted a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample of Chinese chen xiny.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was passed on to my home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoetins.
He was placed in Rio for the fourth time in a woman's 100 m butterfly.
The Brazilian newspaper Estadao reports that the Chinese sister has brought her doping cases to the attention of the International Court of Appeal for Sport.
Xinhua tells us that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping doubts have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC news that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormones.
Kenya has, in turn, passed from Rio to the home of the general sports coach for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had submitted a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan quick-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-metre racer Ferguson Rotich in a situation.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historic gold became a display style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, swims 200 metres apart in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps, as the first swimmer, achieved Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' profit period was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion a second before China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC Olympic Commentator Helen Skelton laughs at the Istalehti's quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (about) on Monday is this week's most readable on the website of Ältalaehti.
Next door, commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not very stressed if there is a small noise in his revealing and special costumes in the newspaper or in the British newspaper.
Television is a visual media, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-height shoes and short-sleeved dress, with certainly at least sufficient visibility - at least for many conservative British eyes.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and it's just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be disappointed, and maybe he does, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the handle has stretched to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do, it's okay for me, Skelton to grind.
You know what?
It is raised from the empty if it comes from wearing (the drinker).
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for terrorist charges.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police arrested them in connection with the security surveillance of the races.
The police did five more arrests in the same connection and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police arrested in July.
The arrested are believed to have links with the ISIS.
The detainees had, of course, incited violence in the social media.
The message of violence had been disseminated, among other things, in the WhatsApp Service’s recommendations.
Eighty-five thousand police are responsible for the safety of the Rio races.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut down the place from the audience.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the explosion of the package.
This was the third time in the Rio Olympics when the police carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public came in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The audience did not report in the theater by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the other side of the arena.
The police blew up the package and only let the public in control after that.
The drink woke the races up in the Spanish team that had started dreamily.
With two losses, the race started in Spain won Nigeria points 96-87.
In two previous races, Spain achieved silver.
The police carried out a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.

The Argentine lady loved Petäjä-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
The wind at Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Pettäjä-Sire experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady fell in love with the Wind Petäjä-Siren on Thursday at the opening day of the women's surf in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent confessed to the crime.
Because of the car crash, he was stuck, and the others escaped, the head coach of Finland, Joakim Wilenius told.
The athlete considered a long time of protest.
It was not worth doing it because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been useless.
I should have dropped into the water so I could get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finnish went on board until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the accident, the Finnish stayed in place of 27.
The overall situation for the 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
There was little impact on the stroke in the relationship.
Friday is an important day when there are races 10-12.
Edited 0.39: By way of first knowledge, the Petährer-Siren did not protest.
7 special issues that according to science extend the age
Science has explored everything possible between earth and heaven.
These matters have been proven to bring additional years to the person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of the person so that his life extends.
On the other hand, things that a person himself cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include, for example, the tendency to have a central body or a social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't even have to do that. You don't have to do that. You just have to go get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to investigate many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strangest findings.
Science suggests that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drink of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The University of Harvard study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low death risk", particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, we are again talking about studies that suggest that the reasonable use of one of the three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived as parents than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental treatment can extend the person’s life even for more than six years, a study tells.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infections of the life.
They can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more, were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
Besides everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he or she should also have orgasm.
Of course, sport will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute clumsiness.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with large backs had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these aspects with the mortality of the low sheep.
Whether it's an Olympic medalist or Oscar's winning actor, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bloke.
A lot of research has tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life more years.
There are some researchers who suspect that a long time is due to the social status of a person who, in turn, makes it possible, for example, to obtain recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of purchasing behaviour in over 65 years of age found that a person shopping every day, or more likely than a parent purchasing, is more likely to be shopping.
This is because running in specific shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So count your credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
End-of-the-day, run-off-the-wheel drive took off on the truck.
On Friday night, a heavy truck and a passenger car nocturnal occurred in Koskea in Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident occurred at Koskei, the Koskenti and the Sorvastoni in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when a passenger car had run into the same lane, hitting the truck at the right corner.
After the collision, the truck remained upright, but burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car got trapped in the ditch and then over the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972 to drive a passenger car stayed in her car under pressure.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per thousand.
He's suspected of having a bad drive.
The mail sent looseblows to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in the selection of cream from the Salon K-Citymarket because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to the Wall River.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernie, was buying loose cakes from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the bulk cases because Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Posti gets the shipment!
So if you don't get in the lawn window, the sign says.
The sign hanging in the store is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawns.
The food is available at Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and she decided to share it in social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the update.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Facebook, on Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 splits.
Haltia got her own favorites caught up in loose skin pain, even though some valleys were empty.
Postin Jaakko Kaideso, Business Manager for Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Overnight Sanom.
The background is that yesterday, in the fifth stage, three of them were misled in the wrong place (Sinäjoki) and we no longer left to make a sub-delivery (Saloon) at three, but we only carried out five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sano.
The first thing I've ever heard about is the Night Words.
Tear Haltia didn't get hurt by the signs, because she found all her own candy favorite in the selection.
Dirty depression! 30 kilos reduced Lotta Backlund published a picture of her transformation
Coke producer's been cleaning up tens of pounds since she was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared her pair’s change in Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta had a gym and was looking for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
The cooiko, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his reduction career already in 2009.
He's a holistic lifestyle change, and he's lost 30 pounds in silence.
On Friday, Backlund published a pair of photos on Instagram.
The picture shows how enormous Lotta has changed over the years in her appearance.
Before and after backlund, the pair of images has collected several charming comments from fellow artists.
You're great.
We're on the same way, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures, while myself on the same journey of skill, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped his final pounds on the project.
At that time he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten kilos.
During the three-month rehabilitation period, five kilos eventually fell.
Wish of a woman murdered in Lovisa: memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of 42-year-old women who were murdered in Loviisa hoped that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the police dog labour.
Sipoo's Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys donations to the victims' family's wishes for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and also performed his nursing training there.
The vet station is reminiscent of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, the 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own courtyard in the Lovisa Kosken village.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens, and cocks.
A man, 27 years old, suspected of murder, didn't know a woman and they had no connection with each other.
The killer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was wounded in an arrest situation in a life-threatening manner.
However, the vessel survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down Post with a judgment on the infringement of the Equality Act
Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused to practise the temporary agency worker, Kanta-Hämee’s district court judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the majority of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested the intern for salary only a part of the total daily work of the trainee.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activity contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Postal and Logistics Union (PAU) decision on the ban on training.
During last year’s November’s postage, PAU made a decision that Post’s employees do not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who breach the strike.
First of all, the People's News told us.
Returning Turkey to the road that respects human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Federation of Journalists in its earlier letter asked Mr Sipil and Mr Soin to express their concern for Turkish freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini will tell the importance of freedom of the press and of words to Turkey, which has repeatedly brought Finland to its attention.
Putin fired the head of his administration from the position of Estonia's Persecutor
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the president's administration chief Sergei Ivanov from the Kremlin, says.
There comes the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vairo.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, reports the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration at the chief.
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will be transferred to the specific tasks of the environment and transport according to the Kremlin's newsletter.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other missions and suggested that Persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: Huge acquisition of the ManU against the ban on gambling - does not see at the opening of the Valioliiga
The world record for football transfers is not visible in the field when the English Olympic Games are kicked off during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling was followed by England.
Because of the ban on gambling, Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU when it opened its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, reported the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba an Italian laisseura to Juventus, according to the British media, EUR 105 million.
However, the UK Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, because Pogballe was left to Juventus as a burden of the game ban.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes one match ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow's grandeur is a virtue
The precise criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event aimed at world top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The Festaries have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area will be stabilized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have just a main stage and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahde in Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to the success is a simple question: What kind of event do the people themselves want to go to?
It's kind of strange in the production of events that we think this way.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow will be sold this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 5,000 in the last year.
This year, a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen at the Festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is some kind of funding to do.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle flock, which is driven on huge roads.
That's what we don't want.
The ideology of the successful event has been tempered over the past 13 years, with 130 actors, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller presence of slaves, 15 000 tents will be held this year.
Kallio admits that the event could take place more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazy about the grandeur, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life alive.
If it loses, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the call is that today's great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, activities were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some €20,000.
Last year, the net sales of the company that was running Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can also produce "circles of things" like the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the young, trendy adult community.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as a special fashion.
We want to break up, above all, with the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a red legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rapper and soul-combining festival with the most typical performers.
According to Kallio, Iggy was buoka because it is probably the last time that Iggy will be seen at the gig in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is a hell of a good one and he's done a hell of a good job in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in the flower pots - tourists fled in horrors
Hua Hin, the local time exploded on Thursday night, two bombs.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the purse and blew up by means of cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
At the same time as tourists started to leave bars and return to their hotels, police representative Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989 a wildlife protector, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to a much-sounding picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bartenders, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of persons injured is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, even by the Finns.
No one's known to be dead.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reported that they had known about Hua Hin at least one bomb that hadn't been able to blow up yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been infecting the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby force begins in a war situation
In the event of an acute war, they will only be told to perform combat tasks after several months of swearing a military oath, says Central Finland.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, the Chief of Defence Officer, interviewed by the press, for example, in a military situation of 5.5 months' service, only those who are eligible at the end of their training.
According to the Chief of Education, reserve personnel in the emergency forces are first assigned to the service.
No shipowner or reserve is ordered to perform a mission that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training the crew members in immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during the training of shipowners.
Pamela Tola got a huge reward from the house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price for a separate two-storey building was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth to the health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in December 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the courthouse and in the courthouse.
The court passed a judgment on the case on Wednesday.
It was valid for a judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for legal and investigative expenses incurred by the couple.
The right to a reasonable reduction in the price was a little, because some of the house repair needs had already been known to buyers at the time of the dwelling sale.
However, according to court, manifest construction errors were substantially more serious than had been mentioned.
Tola was looking for a good people's home.
In the courtable court, Tola told us that the couple had specifically sought out the good people’s homes because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had been given the idea that the building was repaired and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the condition check report were not adversely affected.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation risks and accidents and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma came to the conclusion that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly within a few years.
The shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed the growth of microbes, which according to the Witnesses were due both to the rainwaters in the rock and to the earthquake.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to an inspector's estimate, also enter the interior of the porch.
The mites were found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window counter and the basement wash room.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the apartment prior to the sale.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although there were no adequate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to court, the purchasers were able to assume, on the basis of the information they received before the sale, that the building was suitable for residential use as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that the court had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court finds in its judgment.
Horrifying archive discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also in the register of Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article "Dagens Nyheter" how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, has documents recorded in the microfilms concerning a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi bridesms.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German breed office.
The Agency acted under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynaecological studies were conducted in women.
The Bureau of Race examined the backgrounds of women, including the examination of church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's tree.
The women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give the agency the written life and good recommendations from the close.
The Bureau of Race wanted assurances that women were "children's loved ones", "sons" and "good national socialists" who were well-informed in German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids for SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women from the archives.
The SS directors created a state-supported program known as Lebenborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside of him.
The Lebenborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are told.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the access of children.
The honorable wife of a German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the "Aryans" and the "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum pages stated.
The sixth of the traitor Sir, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in the first round of the Finnish day in the Rio Olympics, but stayed in the second round of the round.
In the overall situation, Nirkko rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in place.
The wind of Petäjä-Siren fought for the RS:X class day's departures with seats 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day at 23.
In the overall situation the Lindgrens are located 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulin was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so on canvas"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender bartender in 1995 to tangotunka, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää continues to bustle, and she is currently at a sharp uphill.
Mari Koppinen, a book about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells of his life and career in good as well as in evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total upswing when he won even the crown of the tango in the Wall River in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang a few songs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuuppamäki had composed a tango piece for the man at the request of Kassu Halonen in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of Finland’s most popular pieces of music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so on the canvas!
It's a book that reminds you of.
As for the recording of the song rising up into the world, it would not immediately be expected that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand the perfect and the highest of itself.
Another accident related to the most popular songs in the book occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää resigned from his partner then and finally ended up with the text of the gold piece, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Türmäs were not exactly what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Onllanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the difference were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7 - day news.
The magazine’s news for the distinction between Jar and the ex-love reported too much celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was full of dolls and not true.
Jari, according to the book, called in his rage to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the voter polls predict the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university made a difference, although a few individual researchers may have disagreed with the power of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign "It's the Economy, Stupid" by former President Bill Clinton flew into the British Brexit poll.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic giraffe language
The Centre for Macroeconomics is responding to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey of the profession.
The typical answer is that the finances were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economic explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have an idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, i.e. almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many also have the idea that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the ESC, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were criticised for the level playing field in the BBC, which gave just as much space as a couple of percent of the EU's economists representing the economy.
The EU's hostile press was not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letters on the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were not passed on because the economists represent an elite with whom voters do not have common interests.
While academics like economists would have remained in the EU, in small cities and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will contaminate your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't there?
Every school has immigrant children, too.
How much easier would the children of the right British have to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their answers were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, Britain has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund set aside for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments correspond to the Finnish Pertti Olden.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up the A and B plans.
The victory of the camp in B, which is in favour of the EU difference, began to be more carefully anticipated a few weeks before the vote, in the event that the result would be a blow.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We're going to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or cash, Vanhanen says Aberdeen’s only open daily noteable of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to the elderly, the standard level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the money was GBP 3.5 billion at that time.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Olden says about all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was below or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore set aside for Brexit with very different strategies.
Money markets closed down trade
When the EU-led camp won, Europe went mixed up.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
These, together, took the situation and put it in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to the years 2007 and 2008, Old One says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund after it had to close its door.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash collected, but it was ultimately forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the elder, they did not really close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were allowed time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it cancelled the notice.
After that, it was quite even, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He pointed out that, for example, there had been no similar turmoil in the Aberdeen Manner-Europ funds.
However, there was a lot of questions.
Inadequate attention to real estate funds
In the opinion of the elderly, the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
The open funds covered by the closures account for about 4% of British properties.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold on to its funds for the year 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been cut downwards, but the situation does not look 'wonderier' from the point of view of Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, says Vanhanen.
The price of the dollar and the dollar are lowest for 30 years, and the market also has a 15% discount compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of nice buyers, Old One says.
Brexit brought down losses on the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem like much of a lot of things.
But four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, re-emerged to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Oh, my God, that's where you got your head.
I realized this is going for Plan B now, Vanhanen says in another home in Helsinki.
He was heading for work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
The usual silent TV screens at the office were the news, and usually the loud people were silently listening when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display ends flashed from just red.
It was the kind of morning that would never have believed he was alive," says the old man.
Not because, despite the storm, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and that is why the situation was in a way calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started with the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta broke up, the British leadership switched.
The market was starting to anticipate sharp bills for the UK and, in particular, for the London real estate market.
London offices were expected to reduce by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the thunderstorm is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer vacations this week in Helsinki.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already received the first information.
The data of CBRE on price developments by the real estate service company covers about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings in London City, the decrease amounted to 6.1 per cent.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Olden.
All similar falls occurred in 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the Lehman crash and the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not entirely satisfactory, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's a different mood.
The real estate market has now seen not panic sales like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You'll find the funding in the usual way.
The repair operation could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing business is not a miracle of him. That could have been the case without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world's first cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that the city, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started really high.
London prices have been tightening up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership to globalize, the Old One says.
New players have come to the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for investment sites abroad.
London is known as a city as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed a low level of interest rates, which have led, for example, to pension companies seeking returns from new destinations.
On this, the loan has been readily available - although according to the elder, it has now been used much less than in the period before the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, prices went up smoothly last summer, says Olden.
Aberdeen also began to ease its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy evolves, says Vanhanen.
A lot of him is not afraid to judge the future, but he says that there's hardly any ups and downs.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or a steady run ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes that we can get through the pit at work.
If you've been well prepared for the risks, you'll be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in a single market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's been distributed, the risks are also distributed, Vanhanen says.
S-group starts registering shopping information more precisely than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, because the trading group today told us that it is beginning to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
As information on the final amount of the voucher has been collected so far, the group will begin to catch up on products also purchased at the beginning of May.
This is where the S group comes after Kesko, as the data on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes with a marketing authorisation.
The most efficient channel is email.
A few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko is classifying its stock clients according to the only food purchases already into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stockholders are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used.
The information is used for marketing targeted to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing information is only collected from K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer support program and does not have such a program in place.
Finland's Lähikajoki has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer base program, which can be integrated into the selection houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect data on product or product group levels, we will remain at the level of the final sum of the voucher.
So we know where the shopping was done in the store, and I'm the day, and I'm the customer's bill for the final sum.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the client programme is to be renewed in the future, but the Middle East will tell us later.
However, Ora does not allow for product data to be entered.
Initial experiment
So far, SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data have included the profession, education, housing, children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S-Bed card purchase has been registered with the date and time of purchase, place, final purchase amount and method of payment.
In addition, S-bonus partners’ data have been obtained from their cash systems.
From May onwards, product-level purchasing information will start to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data in S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains are recorded at product group level for the time being.
For a longer time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be better targeted," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Business at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored at the cashier in any case, wanted it or not.
Please check the stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers do not access the data, stresses the Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The baby from Black Labradorinnutter is embroidered by five similar boxes set in a row at Helsinki Airport.
Not long after it firmly sits next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with her favorite toy.
From the box next to Heila, a bottled glass - gas shell was exposed.
Ruth’s gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online access
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion away to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks have led to measures at Customs and, after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says the Director-General of Customs Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the training of weapons and explosives to Customs is postal shipments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of an increase in internet traffic, up to 40 million mail shipments per year transit through the airport, among which may be weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made the discovery of around 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives related to online shopping, baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and post office items.
In future, there will be a great benefit for ports when they can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether further arms and explosives will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to the idea.
School with Church Number
Heila-pennu education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonumm.
Suntio also attends police and defence experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and defence forces on explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smell Heila is taught to identify.
The team will always be trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi of Customs.
Labrador explorer Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The choice criteria for a dog to be selected at the airport include repelling and hunting, as well as calmness, since the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntion, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila getting home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from time to time.
Evening-Sanomia's cameraman will lose the mik cover for a fast dog, but Heila will immediately return the cover that looks like a soft toy from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for dogs in the workplace
Heila's gonna graduate next year.
There are still high-level tests to be carried out in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can see work at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come and iron the dog on top, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active part time lasts only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition at Tull.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs.
Happiness was found at Suntion, who had not previously had a working dog, but he has years of experience in dogs and in controlling duties at Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off
At the rugby Olympics of less than a million people in Fiji, it is so highly appreciated that the government has decided to spend August 22nd as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the victory.
The day of the holiday will be held at the team's return home the next day.
The hero team will also have celebrations in its home country.
Fidž rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, I heard their encouragement, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish player fainted after the wild performance
With his last attempt, he succeeded 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening character as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the wrists, he has passed many times.
No one really has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola got 175 kilos of work and a stroke of 145 kilos.
His combined result was 200 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his push, as well as one another, 175 kilos.
In the third company, the weights rose as a result of the horrific rage.
The body shook under the weights until the jury accepted the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired an official guest from Prosa, a salesman's league, an evening chatter.
The men’s football league Rovaniemi Palloseura has concluded a permanent contract with Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team, who has a lot of work to do and whose threshold is small for Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over ten players.
A small group began to be distinguished as a good alternative to Prosa, coach of RoPS Juha Malinen told the press.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from the record-breaking Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
The Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the master SJK of Finland.
The RoPS needed a new attacker, as last year's reignant Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatened by the modern family star, the shorts of the teenage star reveal almost everything
As a modern family comedy series, please Alex Dunphyna, who became familiar with Ariel Winter, re-enacts by introducing the threat to his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to be imagined.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also the back of this.
Most recently, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making its style and use considerably more courageous.
The star has put on social media pictures in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also seen her dress in very scarce costumes.
Winter, which is on the verge of an adult, has recently also published a number of photos of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
The founder and CEO of PowerWomenTV, Amy Palmer, doubted that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it seems to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention is given in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You're inspirational to many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer to visit Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by a boom: In the autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the survey trips from the beginning, says Visit Finland in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese revenu tourism.
Our winter travel boards are strongly linked to the heart winter and the snowy landscape.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a lot of demand for windmills, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that early autumn is the beginning of the boom and continues far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the upwinds of making a vision two-fold random, says the press release Visit Finland's CEO Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s survey campaign are wealthy women aged 25-35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already fully interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University, researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear unique sights in Finland, and Lind says this is a huge potential.
The number of nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly from other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much time in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group because they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Great Britain is satisfied with the rugby silver as Fid takes a master course in gold
The UK’s impressive progress in the rugby tournament broke up with Fidzi’s final challenge in the finals of Thursday night when the team experienced a 43-7 breakout at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a master's course in the process, in bites, in the fights, in the support games, in the running lines and in the silk when he won gold - their first Olympic medal.
The killing involved a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - from the third day of the British Day - and they were proud of their hard work at the rugby start-up tournament of the Olympics, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier on the same day, the hard 7-5 victory of the played semifinal from South Africa could bother them in the final.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won a top-quality team of 15 in this state of affairs.
Great Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: The head coach of Fid is Ben Ryan, former head of Wimbledon in England.
Great Britain has been quite a trip.
Eight years ago, as Ryan's coach, they lost each game in the Adelai tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This spine hurts, but development is shocking.
Fidi started to fight Britain's fights for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell, with his teams, this was like they were running towards mobile buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived at the corner to the finish area.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwa's second touchdown on the right side led to the goal kick.
12-0, and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great jacket stopped the male-mountain Leone from making a third goal, but it was only a slow one for Fiji.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu scored the goal at the right angle, and Great Britain was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa again made the goal of a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...from the first half-time.
After that, Vatemo Ravuvou crashed through the British stockings found and pushed the line to make a goal.
After the goal break, the situation during the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was only learning the game.
And this is actually the case.
On a break, Great Britain made sudden changes that blocked the dam of Fid for a whole four minutes, compared to the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid’s impressive entry game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for the United Kingdom when he scored a touchdown at the left corner and narrowed down the situation to 36-7, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in spectators.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame in the last minute had a peel on Fidi's cake, which did not need to be peeled.
Pills were glowed, the Fijians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
On the same day, in Japan’s semifinals of 20-5, Fidi won South Africa’s tight semifinal, where both scored one goal – the British goaltender solved the game.
Kyle Brown took over South Africa in the first half of the year, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with a blazing foot job and scored the finish at the bottom of the line.
A great late tack from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15-Asia-rugby team in England, secured victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer was part of Helen Glober's and Heather Stanning's rowing victory.
In these races there will be no feelings more intoxicating gold, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 tough race towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in the golden moment in Estacio da Lagola.
Even if they called each other, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams’ echoes were present all the time when the twin argued for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women’s pair competition - the first women in the history books of British sports that reach such achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record record.
This, as we can see, is not a complete picture of the nature of the victory by two brilliant athletes who are joining us on the surface with the solitude of the swan.
The background for each ball is a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually promote the things that matter, and no hand pair was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day after he had been diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if the expression can ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked all over the department, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
I know it's a trip in itself, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a captain of the Royal Cannon Rhythm experienced by the Afghan command, said: "I've been a sentimental building this week, which may have been a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just underlines how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, so he's a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition for five years.
A couple set a rough rhythm to which their competitors did not prevail.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good match and a race, and so we did.
A couple of years before you decide on your future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on us.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took me about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to replace the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will organise the early parliamentary elections, which have already been demanded by demonstrators who have been ravaged by Panamanian information leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold the new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the final rage of the people will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the powers was clearly expressed, and the election of Mr Johannesson, who was elected as President from outside politics, was made conditional.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama Daddy was the founder
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his most recent speeches.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the seated President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis, and that the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in the establishment of an organization.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone down like that go to the Chief of the Army, Clinton.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-popular cannula on the swimming beaches, including the British magazine Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a respectable swimsuit.
The decision also states that bathing facilities, which largely express religious connections, may increase the risk of disturbances of order in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to the celebrated French national day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Daddy attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the Oulun bathing waters passed through the sieve - Lake Veykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the Lake Badge has been observed on the lake’s beach with blue vegetation.
During the Tuesday and mid-week, the Oulu region's environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of the shores of the sea, the levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the limits set by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
Marine bathing water E.coli and enterococcal concentrations were confirmed on Wednesday, at which time bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue vegetation observed on the lake shore of the lake is not yet ineligible for swimming in water, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly become a blueflower, making the surface of the water a blue-green pasture.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more intensive inspections.
In the event of a change to a blue-winged assembly as a blue-winged group, the notification table for the bathing area shall also be used to provide specific information on the matter.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
TMK’s Hakkaraine Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside the forest
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's proposal for next year's budget.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holding.
The Ministry of Finance's presentation of a forest gift reduction has four objectives: promoting the generational change of forest spaces, raising the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest holdings and increasing the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the net income from the forestry industry.
Overall, it is a good idea to make such a tool to promote the generational change of forest spaces, commenting on the forest manager Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the hackraine finds criticism in the tax reform proposal.
The forest gift reduction is to be provided for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
This is the amount of capital that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the view of MTK and Hackraise, the impact of the tax reduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the proceeds of the sale of the timber.
The VM’s proposal is based on the fact that a reduction in the pure capital income of the forestry industry is prevented from resulting in a loss of the capital income of the forestry industry, which should be deducted under other taxes.
Such a person would have a tax advantage, even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners, according to him.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high by the hackers.
According to him, it cuts 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction circles.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest policy, forest gifts have been exported to Hakkaraise for decades.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful rage surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars got caught up and ran into each other.
There was a special chase on the fish at Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue plant, two consecutively driven cars were derailed by a ditch, after which a collision occurred earlier.
According to Harri, the fire master of the day friend, he was asked to defy his ore due to the heavy force of force.
In the back of the car there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more detailed information about their injuries.
Until now, the driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 Himangala a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at Turku University can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of academic professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the cancer's malignantness.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was able to prevent laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the studies have been published on 4 August in the popular Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The fall of the moustache's family home is continuing in court, the prosecution also requires a murder sentence for another person.
The fall of the Muhu family home is continuing in court for both of the convicted.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for a family home in Muhokse.
One of them received eight years of four, including a young person’s murder and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for a young person who has committed murder and a brutal robbery.
The convicted person also received a judgment on the serious threat to road safety as a young person and on the right to transport as a young person.
The District Court judge complained of the prosecution, the lawyers, and the man who was given the toughest sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser sentence for a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison as a young person.
Were at the time of the act in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as the director of the Child Welfare Unit at the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old man who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the couch in the living room, according to the reasons.
The director had gotten away from him and moved the young man into his room, where one of the young man hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind study, both of the convicted were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to flee family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing only at 156 years of age
For the longest living vertebrate in the world, ice cream is confirmed, says a study published in Science.
In the North of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark floating around Greenland, the Holker can live for up to 400 years.
She's only growing up when she's 156.
The fact that it only grows in centimetres a year is added to the life of the ice shark.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than any other species.
The scientists discovered the age on a radio-carbon drive.
Some sharks had radioactive residues due to nuclear tests in the 1950s.
Based on these, the scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years - although a throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wise man - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if Donald Trump’s change to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without a collection, there would be a huge amount of money, a thousand billion dollars a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount of 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be revised and the energy sector rules must be abolished.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is one of the major causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be suspended.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 % tax and a 35 % penalty tax on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalisation, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch at sea, American steel will lift new cloudlights all over the country.
By contrast, Trump faithfully read the speech written by assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early Friday in Finland.
A wave of attacks from the past - The People's News
The sea is fatally raging, but the actual wave of attack is striking in the middle of Madrid's street - the account with the past can begin.
It summarized Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
The previous steering work by Almodovar Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a satirical comedy, the previous Skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the Spanish career.
As a rule, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a love, human and family drama of the contemporaneous seagulls, with a mother-daughter relationship at the center.
The story is a chimp and we see it as a long ass.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be a miracle at the end of the film until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Juliet once took the steps of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, a well-known TV show between Ommelten (2013-2014), will be on the rise.
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered as a kitchen, but I would say to myself that time is cleverly and verbally with a single bath.
For Almodóvar films often with such distinctive scorching, including humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It's a steady-played, held-in, place of good music and quite sad film, where such is the material for the elegance.
On the other hand, a typical visual color alertness for the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to inject a small silence into the eye as a more clean form than a functioning dramatic mode of action.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a person named, the accommodation varies from one scene to another, and the same applies to the places shown.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, the impressions of the previous scene, do not improve more.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Nobel Prize-winning Canadian Alice Munro in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book Karkulainen: Relatungen.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equal written filming of literature.
Alexia would have had an emotionally incomparably tougher drama, and that's the big deal - especially the mesmerizing guilt - of the film's thematics.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novelties by Alice Munro.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to make an election - The People's News
No new cuts will be made by the powerful ministers so that the basic Finns will not collapse altogether.
However, cuts decided in the spring will be made at the topping shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The savings of four billion already decided will be sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (coc.) convince under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the presentation of the VM, as the cuts in social security were already decided upon in the spring framework.
Child benefits, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but the kennels are haunting you.
Why do the ministers stress so thornyly that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year's election year.
The county councils are held in April and they are the most important meters of fever in the parliamentary term, not gallops.
In the past, it has been seen that the result of the rule of law that takes place in the different directions of government has been ruining the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the government party for the basic Finns is expecting a smoke-absorbing coup, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
The basic Finns received 752 new representatives four years ago, of which a large part will be realized next spring by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three about as large parties' governments is to be expected to last for the basic Finnish people's lives.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party voters have had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visiting status have also come to an end.
First, the fact that next year they will be made brutal and, secondly, the attempt to soften the waiting attack on the basic Finns will not be obscured by the rhetoric of new cuts.
Major cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the target for indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take on EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the local authorities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government cannot comply with its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other one's holding onto the program.
This means even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget line on top of the former ones.
The budget would strike at least a close balance in 2018 and then, in the spring, the parliamentary elections will take up what is coming.
The debt does not seem to be the case with these measures.
It is quite clear that the current debt-to-GDP measures are not working, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to create a positive atmosphere.
The visits made by the Secretary of State, Mr Martti Hetemä, in the knowledge of the Budget, are unrecital to this effect:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no call for international economic assistance.
Finland’s economy has not just risen since the collapse of 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy implemented at the beginning of the 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35 per cent and increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now pays more than EUR 3 billion a year than in 2008.
At the recently presented curves, government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief of the left wing association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the sense of responsibility of the city center, the assembly company and the basic Finns.
Question: There is a desire to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four think that child day care, youth work and exercise are the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research carried out by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population is also depriving the individual municipalities of responsibility for libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, secondary education and waste management.
For their part, the province's responsibility is more clearly expressed in the form of a provincial plan, special health care, vocational training, universities of higher education and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the tasks of the local authorities are to be transferred to the State.
Underage runner ran after a drive to the end of the police escape.
Joensuuläinen 16-year-old motorcyclist drove a police patrol away in Joensuu, in Joensuu, on Friday night for half a time.
The police party tried to stop a motorcycle driven without light, but the young man left to run away from the police with a fair speed.
The back drive continued to Sonkajanrannant, from which continued to Sorronahont and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after that, the young man went running away, but a faster-footed cop ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per thousand.
Nor did he have a driver's license that would have allowed driving a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock fell into its axe
The truck in the rock shed fell to the ditch on the lake Polvijärvi in Kaavinti at 9:15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curving bend out of the road and fell on its side.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first-hand workers.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From the fallen truck, hydraulic oil spilled into the road. The rescue plant was sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in the Airfield
Since the afternoon, 87-year-old woman has been on the street in the Lahden village of Ilmajoki in the South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman with a white jaw under her hair, about six inches [165 cm] long, thin and grumpy.
Observations and hints on missing movements are requested to call the Situation Centre of the North-West Region's tip number 0295440513.
The material of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The crash of the tent of the Parafest festivals caused considerable damage.
The president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will reach its feet economically, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performance of the Parafest at Kalle Salone was at the end of Friday night on the Thursday.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations held at the city theatre from 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 1:15.
The program will be organized as planned.
The causation flow is generated in the thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling air flow.
The changes in the water condition of the udder bind heat and therefore the falling air will cool and its speed towards the ground will accelerate.
The Institute of Intelligence reports that the flow rates occur in Finland during several summers.
It's hard to predict the path of the crash currents.
The crash flow struck the location of the Parafest in Joensuu Art Museum’s backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to an end, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Accidentally, four people hurt themselves lightly.
There was one child among them who was transported in mild injury to further treatment.
Air pollution and ageing of the Londoners
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
Evening Standard tells of British research.
Caci, a British skin care company, analyses London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly couple living in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A study by Cac found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who are walking on their work trips in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution by, for example, different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed the man standing in front of you
The man had moved stones in his yard circle on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall short of it, but the tractor, however, had to be carried to the central hospital for further serious injury.
The tractor didn't get any longer, because it hit the rocks in front of it.
Draining for the coming season with the most powerful
The riverside league playing in the U.S. Air Force is starting from a series of better starting points in October than a man's memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone is certainly better than the previous seasons when the series began to be dark in Rienno.
Jani Säis, who continues as the main coach of the line, praises the new team for their commitment and unity.
In Rienno, Fred Musoni starts his second season in the middle fight of the three foreigners.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who's a member of Rwanda's national team, is a 205-inch hunter.
Garchet is similarly suitable, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimetres.
Through Jozban, Katajan and the Joki boys to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing almost all the Hallbandy MM games since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, but only in 2013 was better off in the North American race.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, the species was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
That's what they used to play at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokiboys hockey in the SM series, Jumppane remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university's salibandy SM series in 1991-92, the following three throughs spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls in the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
All in all Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, the balance amounted to 169 in the match 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were named to the national team
Josban, a Joensuu salibandyseuran, raised Perttu Puska and the English-led Tatu Väänen, was elected to the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old who attacks in Helsinki, has played this before six men's championships where he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänen, has retired from the travel team and is part of the country team’s standard equipment with 117 terrains experience.
The country team was also named "Maika Kohonen" by Seinäjoki's poker player Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last time at the World Cup last December.
The main coach of the Salibandy team is Petri Kettunen from the Gulf of Conti.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - baby SM is missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is stopping as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current period.
Beach full of Finnish championships will be settled in Kouvola Sports Park during the weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in groups of both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airballists and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament is awarded to the six best pairs of each series.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's educator Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is eager to wait for games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will be able to take a look at you this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesi Stadium.
I haven't played in adults in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu's atmosphere.
The Kouvola region lit up the spark of Hasu and gave good lunches for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories about childhood.
I started a balloon when I was 9 in the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main one is in mind too large a shirt, in the ankles round knee covers as well as huge ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small community there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the team mate trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural variety selection during the junior season in contrast to the ball.
The biz has been played on the shores of the lake since the 1990s.
It's always been active on trips.
I also went to the junior SM contests myself, thinking that some day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Pieksäkelän Anniina Parkkise in the SM finals.
Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahde have a clear goal for a second hard-hitted double in the tournament.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We don't even have a prize cap on the SM- baby, Hasu throws it in a mysterious way.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last known audience to Hasu.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
I'm sure the international career will be over after the Kisakalli tournament.
Otherwise the toes are put in the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Pass flow dropped tents at the disabled event in Joensuu, the major accident was near
The crash flow dropped three tents at the Parafest Festival for the disabled in Joensuu.

According to the cattle, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the largest tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
The fire master Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by the Karelian newspaper, tells the newspaper that there was material to a major accident.
According to the paper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an enterprise means risk reduction, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Soon, two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Kol began to operate as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the holding so that bread could come into the hands of agriculture.
This has been my little boy ever since.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard house, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself really courageously joined the project and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli tells and adds that if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is going to be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who is raising meat cars, is to invest even more in a bigger hub.
The work has produced a result, for Solomon’s Koli has been elected to the top ten in the competition of the young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria stood at 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since last October, when positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index of July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the rate of inflation was -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, the following consumer goods prices showed an increase in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
The Snapchat "anime" performance is evaluated as Asian richets
Snapchat says that anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its 150 million daily user to edit and identify the reality of playing in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, face-to-face twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfie a day.
All the illusions quickly end up in public documents.
The Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for advertising blackface mask or favoring bleached skin colour as a beauty fabric.
So when Snapchat announced this week to some users a lens that gave them the twinkles of eyes, twinkles of teeth and bottled cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow-faced" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem of diversity.
News and anger spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, day after Snapchat said he had ceased to be a character.
The company offered an explanation: Linsi was meant to be a tribute to anime figures, not caricature from the Asians.
But the lens of racist observers was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly banned anime-verbalism.
Grace Sparapain, a Korean-American art student whose tweets of photographs were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with the adjacent gross Asian enrichment and filter efficiency".
It shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced but yellow-faced to extreme lowness.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse youth can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, aged 25, said in the interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a user-injuring image, "for these guys it's much more difficult to be unnoticed than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, a head of product and engineer working for the Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his article to the Medium and the telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu evaluated the company mainly for the white men's leadership and decided to write a hashtag with #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"Both they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colours in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different skin colours at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting that it has a status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but the representative said that some time ago the company hired the recruiter to focus on the underprivileged populations and to carry on internal integration efforts.
For their part, Zhu said that keeping his Snapchat account closed added: "Is it true that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to Congressional panel, military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said that the U.S. headquarters of the armed forces in the United States had designed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against the Daddys than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of the Task Force on Defence Forces of the House of Representatives, the Republican Chairman, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Sub-Committee established by the interim report of the Task Force "Extremely Dissatisfied" among the headquarters's intelligence analysts, who said that the superiors weakened their assessment of the American efforts to win the ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the Florida Tampass military headquarters, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the investigation, typically approved by the higher-ranking Centcom leaders, gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground, which were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by the other elements of the intelligence community," the press release said.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - our fighters suffer in the war when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Californian Republican.
The failure of Centcom's management goes all the way to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail ongoing problems in the descriptions and analyses of the headquarters in the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that Obama’s high-ranking administrative authorities have ordered reports to be thumbed, it describes the feeling of analysts that Centcom’s leaders have put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were much more positive than events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of Daddy.
"After six months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, representative of Kansas Republican.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces headquarters manipulated the output of the headquarters's intelligence in order to mitigate the threat of Isis in Iraq.
After hearing the group, the Republicans created that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday follows larger results while the investigation is under way.
An additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's investigation has begun by the Department of Defense.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Committee of Inquiry of the Chambers published their own findings that were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican working group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process for the intelligence assessment of the Isis and Iraq security forces, a process that was too isolated," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading democracy.
According to Schiff, this process 'suffered the publication of intelligence products', made the mood worse among analysts and 'suffered enough space for different perspectives'.
The ship and the Democrats said that they could not find evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to agree on their conclusion to the "pre-set or political narrative".
The Daily Beast reports on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspector has initiated an investigation into Centcom’s analysts after complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation also has more follow-up than just the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on an honest assessment by the headquarters of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of the war.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects more than a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite objections from several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also in the key role of rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, expressed against the nobles of the Islamic state had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary workings to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth consecutive women's field hockey event with Britain
The day after having scored three goals on the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored two first goals on the U.S. women’s ground hockey team on Thursday when the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his paintings."
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 situation at the Olympic tournament and they are sharing their team first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan's 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and the United States meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter gap, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be the second of their six teams in their group.
First-placed to avoid a strong Dutch, second-group leader, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
Whatever the end of Saturday’s game, the Americans have raised their highlight with surprising success here, four years after they left the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, where he first picked up a field hockey bat at the age of three (for the first time, when his parents played the species in Drexel) when he joined the country team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player of all time.
He was not at the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went to him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we have now.
We've done a full turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the finish near the finish.
India had come to play in the air with no win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the situation in 1-0 readings until the end of the third round, when Bam took the situation.
He carried the ball from the left side of the field for a long time, then he circled around the center and threw the ball into the paint, leading the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added four more in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who had released one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We now have a good situation," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of Trampolin in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are running.
Rio de Janeiro’s events seem to be a constant and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic World itself is a flashing signal cap that is passed on from the archery to the swimmer and the gymnast to the triathlonists.
It's impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation with a friend in a coffee line without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time and future heartbreaker of the Olympics with a smile, could well be one of the names known to all those who are presented at the best viewing time and who support sponsorship agreements as well as the TV commercials of a good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a sworddozer.
But Dooley, 28, from California Lake Forest, competes for the Olympic Gold in the trampoline.
The Olympics do not illuminate all species as much.
Far away from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted: aerial gunfire, archery, plumber, taekwondo.
We've always got a breastbath, and it'll be a long time to live.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first appearance in Sydney races, there are so few observations about its presence between the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won the medal, nor has its athlete progressed to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russian usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLenna are defending their gold medals in London.
Trampoline, however, is associated with a certain kind of underage charm, in part because, in my uneducated place, it sounds more appropriate to the clown school than to the Olympic.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just a fan of the Air Force.
There are opportunities for amusement, as is seen from the color of endless pomps in cartoons, but there is also the sweetness of anointing and swimming jumps, two species which in principle unite.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a pantry board.
The champions jump up to almost 30 feet on a giant trampoline, and they have to perform rolling lines of business (translations, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
As many as they want, they have to go to the gold field looking for more, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, around the field.
They are not just hunting the goalie or the initial wall, but also, in television news, the other loose limit: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical, and it can even get a viewer's tears.
But it is also why watching races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
Trampolin's heading up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to the new rise, acting as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no fierce rush to the end during the programme, no jumps to the distance, only the dreamy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen space as what can be achieved at the Olympics.
The women's race and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's races will also be held on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon software starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympian drugs, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most probably fails to notice in the public chaos.
And if awareness is only gained by offering men's sportsmen to be starved and objectizable (as suggested by the US male soldiers some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new, poking fanship.
"The Generation Shows Its Mind" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government demonstrations have shaken the country as it spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people ran into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
They said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The distributed videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people in a small way while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager for the Horn of Africa project group International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new train for tourists.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken about the oppression of the government, the country's opposition has been limited and opponents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far to the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no alternative but to show their mind, this is what will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher on Central Etiopia.
The whole youth shows their mind.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition over land use.
After many critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last place to hold the opposition, and now it holds all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing. Hundreds of lives were required in June for this intense and controversial battle along the border.
Analysts fear that Separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have over the past few years been more or less overthrown, can try to take advantage of the shock and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why, after years of drought, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and Internet service improved.
Although the government would close access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through hidden network brokers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the troubles and the amharas, are getting better on with each other.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amarians, who come mainly from the Christians in Ethiopia, have succeeded in politics and business, using concerns that many of them are Muslims and who live in the valleys.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organise ourselves under a single umbrella," said the director of concern, Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the amhara and anxiety areas.
Many bitter and troubled people think that Ethiopia is a member of the Tigre nation, which covers about 6% of the population and is a member of the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who looked around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"The National Council does not have such a basic instinct," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, was found relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the northern Etiopian tiger region, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigers don't trust him.
Many are afraid that this may lead to increased bleeding.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in the grip of such a quake in 2005, when thousands expressed their opinion on the elections that, according to analysts, seemed to be the first to be tormented by the government and then robbed by them.
In the course of the subsequent outbreak, many demonstrators died, even less than in recent months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visual infrastructure planning, such as the new road, and for the considerable progress made in the fight against poverty.
Clearly, however, this has not stopped the increase in the contempt of the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though some time ago it said it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to be ready for the collapse of their allies in the region.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based Daddy claims as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his most recent campaign of power on Friday, claiming that he was not serious this week when he many times incited President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American people.
It also placed his defenders, who have covered up to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following the announcement at the campaign meeting on Wednesday evening, Trump said the same thing more and more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, where he insisted that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
But in early Friday morning Twitter Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed in serious charge.
When Conservative radio operator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to break his point by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Daddy, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has refocused his campaign in the midst of economic opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday Trump tried to get back to the subject.
I run to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the talk boring.
Trump's been using sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after he apparently encountered a broad criticism when he suggested that Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I am sarcastic, of course".
The approach allows Trump to make political speech at the borders and then return, if necessary.
"I think it is a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' the direction or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language use of both candidates.
But I also think that he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of easing his speeches for the big voting audience, Trump has been even more sabbatical in recent days when his favor has continued to fall.
The new poll, published on Friday, NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, showed that Trump is falling significantly behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While, as a rule, Trump tries to avoid making excuses for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misconception of his words or of misunderstanding his sense of humor.
When faced with ever closer scrutiny of the presidential campaign over the past few months, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolf W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump’s most important supporters, took a lot of trouble defending the candidate in CNN’s interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Daddy to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings of Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter from an attack on the news media, which chew his every word and are neutral against him.
He ridiculed "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to make it clear to him, saying "They can't do it!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he was inappropriate as president.
Formerly closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shaky, cash-friendly place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but it offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue's street arm was too expensive for it.
The movement, which replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a middle class town to be renovated.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a new invention.
The restored Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and can be paid with credit cards, but some staff are still the same and there is the same unfinded atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, an old coffee shop's long-term employee, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things going on.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought some new ingredients.
The food list includes bacon-cane egg-pots of cheese, and in the coverings there are curds and browned onions, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
No longer serving beer in the coffee shop, but fresh juices are made there.
For nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady flow of old stock clients.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One last Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that after Verb had closed, he gave up his coffee drink for a while.
"I realized I was enjoying Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, although on that day he ordered his regular ice cream instead of his mixed chai drink, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, loyally visited Verb since 2003.
He used to work there, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly as a clock, I went in and they were preparing the spices of my bakery with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of variety he has room for a spiced bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge for the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, Soap Cherie’s owners offered to make a special bag for Verb, which would be used as a ingredient for the cold - extracted coffee in the coffee shop.
"I think we can still grab the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted a cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to present it to someone soon to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new position has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-rolled coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the next building.
For many customers, they get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a stand-up client and said it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I've been looking to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: depressive food
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
As a delicious kiss, President Roosevelt enjoyed fine food on Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver patch, and Maryland's parakeet soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and for dessert from plums.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who are suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple at Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coen's latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life on the Lower East Side Floor through his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet the journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small-scale, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the recession.
"The bulls were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut, liver, parrot.
They were made of a manufacturing material and a cheap ingredient which continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine so many peanuts of your cancer that they would make up your dinner.
Coe's out of control.
"I'm sure it's been felt in the stomach like a lead bag," he said.
In the years before the recession on the American tables, especially in the countryside, was like a eat-as-a-man-like table.
Women’s groups fed male farm workers, and the fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"This food became a central, distressing topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One was a new, affordable diet: Mystery fish, such as squids and crates, became the main food, and the box was "a great way to use food springs," said Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly administered luxury.
Special compositions were tested when the amount of calories and nutrient content were more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
In the course of research, Ziegelman also prepared a food of the age in which fried onions were filled with peanuts.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
The church said, "It was unrealistic."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Domestic experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to start as "budget visitors" and to respond to the challenge of converting messes such as social spaghetti and carrots into tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is a historic treat party.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat your cake attitude.
At the same time as he publicly praised his simple, Iowan country food for his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with a throat sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in his dining room.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in sleeping, the White House became a place that "offered not only food from the ducks of Washington, but also food that was worse prepared."
Many of the paralytic eating habits were rejected as soon as the land got back to its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they achieved a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
The church remembered, "He even sicken people."
There was a windstorm attack.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew up the dessert they had prepared at home: the bone marrow meal that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a bone marrow wax," Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give a name to modest recipes.
There was no cream wax in the dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to put their spoons in a sticky, brown vest.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe's one time and another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A few cracked walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal costs in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. Civil Service Tribunal has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to the legal costs incurred in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc. concerning hepatitis C patients.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments after their violation of two Merck patents, which were associated with Gilead’s successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvon, which resulted in the American judge finding Merck’s abuses, which included false oaths and other unethical practices.
In a judgment handed down on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can significantly improve more than 90% of patients with this disease.
The court case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought an action against Gilead’s active substance sofosbuvir-based laboratory work.
U.S.-supported forces say that they have totally conquered the Manbij, ruled by the Fathers.
The U.S.-backed troops have taken control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left town, the group representative said Friday.
Syria's Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 winged prisoners, who were held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish SDF's Allies, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to study it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly 5.3 million dollars in speaker fees, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book, which reported on his career at the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with her wife Anne Holton, published the ten-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for economic transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in the statement.
In a steep contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
As a rule, the US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even if the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have relied on the audit of the tax administration as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns on the democratic candidate.
On Thursday, the special assistant of Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he will not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other ties, for example, to Russia.
Clinton has caught up with the problem on Friday with the online video that brought out visible Republicans who are calling on Trumpi to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last decades has done: publish his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column borrowed numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported billionaire investor Warren Buffett's designated rule that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, which is located there by the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main target was a cheap, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Chili powder condoms and bivalve molluscs enhance the protection of the elephants in Tanzania
Natureguards in Tanzania use unusual means to prevent elephants from walking in people's settlements - they throw animals with chili powder filled condoms.
The event has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, invented the idea several years ago, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-violable way of using four steps to protect homes and hundreds of animals without damaging them.
Before, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the day of the world's elephants, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their field," said Damian Bell, Managing Director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include the identification of an intruding elephant with a flashlight and the ringing of the peat.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw so-called "chilipilvi."
The condom is filled with chili powder and soil mixture and with a syphilis, and then the condom is wrapped in such a way that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit up, it bursts and bursts chili powder into the air.
One filter is usually enough to send a elephant in the other direction.
The last way to do this is to launch a trigger that's shooting into the air with the Roman candle, and the joy ultimatum is producing a loud, bright explosion.

The French, a Jewish-style filmmaker, released the media storm after it was revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s direction number. According to the worker, this is due to the Arab clients’ "demands".
Claude Lanzmann, a documentary film about the Holocaust, excavated his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann looked to find the country code list offered by the Israel Hotel.
However, there was no mention of the country among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via his own telephone centre.
In his search for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that came from there was "stinking him."
The hotel's prescriptionist said that it was a "conceived decision of the management of the Kempinski hotel".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock to the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the Israeli direction number to be removed," the employee says, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "a great miscarriage", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great mistake in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "take over" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Beam" was said in another publication, where it was noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called the event "unwatchedness" as well as "excuse me" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the list of quick elections was never made," said the Kempänsk representative, according to the said Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students.
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students met to express their opinion against the government’s public education system reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to break up the student corps, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paolo, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed down and 300 000 pupils would be resettled to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen to write on the walls a recent graffiti against President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters took off as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested by the country's Senate in his election.
NT1 trade between Russia and Iran
After the withdrawal of the embargo, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent from the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
After the departure of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have largely demonstrated their interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Actually, bilateral cooperation in Iran is one of the main objectives of expansion of trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent from the same period of 2015 to a total of $856 million.
Russian exports to Iran in particular increased by 91.5%, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
"The increase in the cost was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagarya expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted approximately 35 000 visas to Iran’s citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It's safe to say that last year's record of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The Scots Callum Skinner fell into the paint when the British caught cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner honored the men's team print at the Rio cycling stadium last night when the British team's triangle defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his scotch colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man when he scored a goal against the victory of the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick when they placed modestly for the sixth of March in the World Championship in London, even though Hoy has subsequently decided to compete.
The problem between the Beijing and London races was the replacement of a special transporter named Jamie Staff.
This may have been accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's termination also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom British coaches held onto the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner made the Olympic record at the time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British three won a double for gold.
Hindes was right behind him after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to the top, and Skinner held on to it.
The change in strategy was a large part of the change in shape, and it was part of Hindes' drive at a larger speed, in order to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert in the BBC and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the award group.
23-year-old Glasgower Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made an Olympic performance in the final and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the UK competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overpowering.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British tickets on my feet."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won a total of seven of ten cycling races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny’s condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s prowess, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have a total of six gold and one silver medals.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will be competing in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoyed this one now.
The team competition is always the best.
They win it together with their friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owa Doull were the fastest four-man, four-kilometre team-drivers in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
London 2012 gold-winning world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of competition, when Wiggins will be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time-times when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavia's Katie Archibald made progress at the time of World Record, stopping at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its awesome cycling team will take over the center of the Olympic Games and reach the entire team of medals.
Having presented a truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio races.
The background has been a drama, the least of which has not been the technical leader, Shane Sutton, the difference in April due to the sexist and bullying charges, as well as the end of the competition for seniors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
On the basis of the first evening's competitions at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that the legendary reputation of Great Britain now can rise to its peak at a perfect moment.
The future of Portland's smelt because of the cut-off of the electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium sink, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the plant's electricity distribution company revealed that one of the plant's owners is in the process of concluding a distribution contract, so there is expected to be a cut in all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian administration earlier this year that the aid required to keep the factory operating will not be continued.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs can be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Even 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the slug uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland slug loses money and is under the fence of closure.
The measure is now following the speculation of the factory's future for several years, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of the factory's price of production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium sink at Loy Yang An, Latrobe Valley, said it is also expecting the agreement of three other owners.
Most of the plants are owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"The AGL is awaiting the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the physical electricity needs of the meltless plant will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects the agreement to produce results by the financial year 2017", said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from 2018 onwards are currently limiting the strong prospects for the futures market in wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts by $187 million in the bookkeeping process "in anticipation".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the sludge in operation or to secure the seamless electrical supply".
The US company said that it entered into a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew.
The analysts have been alert to the potential closure of both the Portland sula in Victoria and the Tomas plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Previously in the week, CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts annually.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in [electricity] demand.
As a power producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a real Kardashian TV star, is on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder's brand name post, modelled on the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with which everyone's favorite, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of their sister, but which ended in a classic turn: they designed a surprise party.
This is a cliche of almost every children's television series of the "birth day period" (Seacrest says the words "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-drawn puppy), but Kriss had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new era of the Kardashians with the location of Vogue in September.
Kendallin's sister Kim may have made Vogue's case first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite his own class.
The issue of September Vogue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion said that 615 of the 832 page lesson last year was advertising content).
Its cover is expected to be exposed so much that, for the last two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before the official publication.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelita and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics working as models" than "publics".
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were in charge in 2013, after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as his generation of success models, would hit his first category, he would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or stars of famous people or young people of today who can make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyoncella has been one of the strongest years of her career with Lemonade’s publication.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
In his real TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be bad.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi, calling them "the bitch of this moment."
This feeling got back on the surface with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their applications found behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister, Kourtney, and this kid, she's a real TV star.
The legal centres of the Community are turning away 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 vulnerable people will be turned away from the legal centres of the Community each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its activities already at the extreme limits.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair executions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
The legal services that have already been extended to the outermost regions of the Community will be prepared for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Community legal centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only worsen.
"Queensland's legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need," he said.
The people who leave from violent relationships with uncontrollable and disastrous debts, the families who are separated from their homes, the unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will have to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brand of Queensland to withdraw these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to raise legal aid funding to the level of the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and its customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought to justice after the alleged threat of a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for not doing anything, according to the allegations, after they were told that the head of North Carolina’s campaign threatened a gun worker in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described by former software practitioner Vincent Bordin of the state campaign in Charlotte on Wednesday at the state court of the state.
My Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that 'it would not happen'.
Chief Earl Phillip "unloaded the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pin against Vincent's knee," Bordini said in the suit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said the complaint.
"We don't have to fire things for damage," Bordini said in the action.
The challenge arises only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the second increase in the number of people" - usually including the arms owners and arms dealers - could take action if his competitor, Hillary Clinton, were elected and elected judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context, and that he does not support violence.
The campaign is challenging Bordin to seek compensation for careless surveillance, as well as for Phillip’s violence, ill-treatment and emotional intelligence.
Mr Trumpi's representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request.
The attempts to reach Phillip didn't succeed.
WCCB, a local news girl in Charlote, reports Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call submitted to Innovative Consulting Services by his consultancy was not answered immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the Olympic spirit and expand on Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flowering to the whole stomach, not only to local communities and various parts of London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great attraction, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London races, when we saw tremendous effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities will be provided with 10 000 new training places and 40 000 new jobs, and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 London races, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for races, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
Suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles are always to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for many, not just for few.
It is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs and the economic growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has carried out the 11 billion-dollar infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget: from the T5 voted to the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 built between the two most busy runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to carry out the third runway, which supports 16 billion pounds of private money.
London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a heritage of skills and employment from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse game to prevent ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies bypassing the advertising program is a "kick and mouse game", one of the companies preparing such a program said.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers on their computer-based pages, Adblock Plus published a blog article saying that users can update the program filters to prevent again advertisements on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code is being exchanged around advertisements to make it harder for advertisers to see which parts of the site are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been going around the new code.
In the blog, Adblock's representative, Ben Williams, wrote that "a back-to-back fight between an open-source advertising community and its tourrs has been underway since the prevention of advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great sorrow of advertisers for industry.
Worldwide, some 200 million are using advertising barriers, as reported in last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is behind the advertisers of the pages used by the computer, because mobile advertisers do not work on Facebook mobile applications for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising still generates enough revenue to make Facebook think it worth investing in this kind of activity.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "advertising" tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," said the Facebook representative in the e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She stayed under the car on the Swiss highway apparently for suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eye-catchers after a woman was on the highway for several hours under the road in the early hours of Thursday, a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges' Vaudi Township just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "unwanted act" and sat down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, the Vaudi police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several event-related drivers have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, told the police who are appealing to them and all the witnesses who witnessed the incident to register.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation," lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"But let's see if anyone from the involved drivers gets to blame.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains up to the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In either case - both of them had a person walking in the dark on the highway - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the magazine was said.
Last year, the police were released from charges of miscarriage after he hit and killed a man who lay on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
22-year-old the victim had been drinking, and had gone out into the way, and the court had been told.
The Court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were justifiably driving and that the man's presence on the road was "very exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once lived
According to the estimates of NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely once to live.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the temperature, water-free coating and CO2 filled with Venus could have been unusual in some cases.
Scientists have previously argued that Venus’ slow rotational speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthly atmosphere, and it could still have been spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the formation of the surface of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas of the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to allow life and rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 percent lower than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces a rain that creates a thick cloud stream that acts as a umbrella protecting the surface from the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the earth's current ones.
The model produced a story from the evolution phases of Venus, similar to that previously assumed by the planetary scientists.
Although Venus was likely to live at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans extinguished and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
When the hydrogen leaked, there was only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere left with the deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy abandons the coach from Avalanche's plague
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the Vice-President of Coach Avalanche and Hockey Affairs, saying that the reason for the lack of impact in the decision-making process of the team was the lack of potential.
The vice president/president of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team is starting to search for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice President of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business and as Chief Coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50-year-old, said in his statement.
During the summer I've been thinking a long time about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the position of coach and hockey vice-president should be fully in line with the organization's position.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
On May 23, 2013, Sakic hired Roy to thank Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sachic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the top coach of the league in the first season of Avalanche 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a central division victory, but Minnesota dropped in the first round of Colorado’s drop games, and the team hasn’t made it in the last two years.
Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 defeats and 4 equals, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card slot for the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups, two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and delay strike
The work of oil workers in the North Sea is being delayed because of the salary, when all the parties to the dispute sit down for the new round of negotiations, the negotiators said.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service company have been randomly arranged on the drilling boards of the North Sea, led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart a process to resolve the current dispute," read the joint opinion.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings from early next week so that we can take a fresh overview of the problems.
According to professional associations, their recent work struggles, which they claim to be the first over 25 years old, were an opposition to possible, up to 30% wage cuts.
In this year, Wood Group cut the fees of contractors in the North Sea by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company’s remuneration is followed by a reduction of 10% for 2014 for contractors in its countries.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people's pay lists and announced its plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant merger with BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low crude oil prices, and this economic situation worsens the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with the leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major North Sea labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea is an essential part of the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in his statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of investment is expected for new projects in the North Sea, compared with the previous five years' average of approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleidia group
The mission of the latest Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of the star speeds of the Pleiadis.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the stars of the constellation are spinning at varying speeds, and how orbitors are linked to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even its solar history," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Centre for Pasadena's processing and analysis of infrared data in the press release
The Star of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now running at their top level.
At peak speed, these adult stars are falling large amounts of star wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they stop the stars.
When the star gets older, its rotational speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of rotational speeds indicates that more massive stars rotated slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger of whom make the peurettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the game, we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because of the proximity of the Pleitadian star base, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for the evaluation of star properties at rotational speeds.
"The game star set offers anchor stars to rotate theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleidia's rotational speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
