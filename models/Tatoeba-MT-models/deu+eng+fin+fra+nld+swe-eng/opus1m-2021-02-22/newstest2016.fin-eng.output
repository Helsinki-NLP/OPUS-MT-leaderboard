Found a 9-year-old boy with runaways in Tampere
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report from Western Tampere with his friend on the move has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, he's been contacted, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The son's father told Night Sanom that he'd been found in the middle of the night.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start work on it.
He was found in the neighborhood of the home. Dad told me.
Ronaldo's ass again... torn from the painting line to Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued to do his job also in the Master’s League.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo about the paint quality of the Champions League turned into at least a moment's later advantage.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goaltender statistics when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits in size.
Real won the match at 4-0.
Juventus has from the beginning stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the D-block of the Champions’ League it powerfully started with a 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The victory was over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city bore the absence of Sergei Aguero, who was kneeling.
Aguero, who had been injured in the election league of the week, only came to the field at the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second group, United, experienced a hard time in the Netherlands after having suffered a 1-2 kill.
ManU's 20-year-old driver, Luke Shaw's guest match, took only 15 minutes.
The PSV Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding bill hit the target against the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw's likely broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of the home stadium in Eindhoven for ten minutes before the medical staff took him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 41st minute 1-0 line, but the joy of ManU only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno settled before taking a break in time.
The PSV winning goal scored Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
Paris Saint-Germain was the beginning of the A-block in the Champions' League of the Painting season.
The matter had been with Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who had changed the PSG used to Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised Johan Wiland, a goalie in Malmö, by the back of the ball.
Edinson Cavani made another half-time PSG 2-0.
PSG has been drawn to the top of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small associations, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow Tsska lost the B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a resignation. The president made the wrong speech.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has made the same speech in the country’s Parliament as he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his speech, apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full life.
Chief Opposition Party MDC demanded Mugabe to resign because this is too old to control.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s head office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, governments should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministers' table.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
The sound of just a little colored college teacher, Shannon Lamb, during the emergency call, tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that her "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the close contact details of the dead woman can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentis's body and a message written on the enemy's side: "I am so sorry I hope I can cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," was said in a letter signed by the experts.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometres to the campus where the police believed he had shot and killed the famous history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at this office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the university staff that he had heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb had called a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the face.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind the locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that the students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but possibly had problems.
The students told me they waited for her hours.
The Prentis death squad, Gautier, says that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, where he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, told Lamb that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university recruitment principles meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not offer him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, to be sure, but there was something in Lamb's mind.
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about one and a half miles south of his parents' house in the Mississippi Greenville suburbs, told Washington County's death investigator Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still on the road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb felt the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3500 students and is located in the city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through friends.
Hairston's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charm at that time.
All the girls were melty wax when she was there, told now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told them that they had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that she had never met Lamb, but had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played some gigs together.
O'Steen told me that her daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several network companies.
The bartender of a strange bar near Gautier, The Julep Room, and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night, against September 5, when Lamb had stopped his guitar and lip harp show for a few people.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We joked and threw you at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year student seminar program and was specialized in Indian and colonial history, reported the school’s English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and she had three little children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was president of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, Delta Staten campus held a candle-braking event involving approximately 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the exhibition, during which the choir of the university sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting on Mississippi Cleveland.
An Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi from Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb had called after Schmidt was shot, and that although I referred to Lamb during the call to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many workers for the holiday period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that today's regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with sales and sales, shipping and delivery.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "the date" with Princess Diana
The first night of the film's return to the future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also worth noting for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to me empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana was next to me," she said, coming up with a documentary film in the Back in Time trailer.
The film starts and I think it's just a mockery and a hand stretch from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the future of the film, which was interviewed by Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
It was 30 years ago that we got back to the future.
Spielberg told me, "I don't think it's the finest time travel film ever."
Back in Time is available as an order video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria is not resolved by armed forces.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to the fact that Russia is increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "does not resolve in an armed manner", and the additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director reiterated his call on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference in the middle of the week, Ban said that he was planning to meet with five permanent ministers of foreign affairs from the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France in the context of the ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
It called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the crisis in Syria, as they demonstrated in the agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support for the evidence that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a windshield.
Some people think she's just a joke.
Some are waiting for a break-up.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trumpi away from the leader of support questions, it has not (many) succeeded.
In the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of a two-digit number, and some have started to think seriously about what this means for the real estate king to be named.
Of course, the election season is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a candidate for Republicans.
The commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to Herman Cain, both of whom did not receive back any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in public elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump's insistence and started to use its resources to destroy him.
The following recent support questions indicate that the real estate king is not just a transitory phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s support questions showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Today, six of the ten Republicans are in favour of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first prefecture states.
Last week, 60 per cent of Republicans said that they welcomed Mr Trump’s request for support from the University of Quinnipiac.
Two thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump were to become a candidate.
In CNN/ORC's survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "incited" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that if they were to be a candidate, they would be "scattered."
Only Ben Carson generates substantially the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "increased" vs. Trump 40%).
Next, the most inspiring?
Marco Rubio by only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "impaired" in the event of Jeb Bush becoming a candidate for power.
Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpi has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday, 52% of Republican voters at the national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the President.
According to a survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac, the figure in the first party state of Iowa is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has a suitable character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Postin questionnaire, 44 per cent think that his character is not suitable for serving as president, and nearly six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real alternative.
According to CNN/ORC's survey, four out of ten people considered Trumpi the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be named as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The Republican Party voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry was nominated as a candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican Party voters believe Trump's campaign to be credible.
Although Republicans would settle to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, since Trump’s support has been distributed among numerous other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie every 33 points.
He's in line with Ted Cruz.
Only Trump's winning candidate?
If they were to be confronted, Ben Carson would win a businessman with Trump's big 18-point difference.
Just and just a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the Trumpi voters have decided who their vote goes to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that they would never change their mind.
46% said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "invaders" in his campaign launch speech two months ago, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's power to drive latin voters further away from the Republican Party and damage re-branding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so too is Donald Trump.
Dismissment of the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump's and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday, in the ABC/Post question, that they prefer a person outside politics to someone with a government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa have frustrated Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "truely angry".
First appearance of Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Minister's Question Time
The first appearance of Corbyn in Question Time has been eagerly expected since his choice
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corby, met David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby will rise to ask his first six questions a little after half a day, and probably both the media and the Labour Party representatives will closely monitor his performance.
Corby has called for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that some of the opportunities could be left to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade unions' central organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silent during the national song on Tuesday in the Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain’s Air Force, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s representatives and has appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said that he "sexfully silent" and that he acknowledged "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
The member of the Corbyn shadow government, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had urged the Labour leader to sing a national song despite the fact that he thought the royal house should be closed down.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved within Corbyn, calling for disagreements in economic, defence and external matters, and less than six months ago, Parliament's party supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the policies regarding the status of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "encumbered" within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
At the meeting of the trade unions' central organisation, Mr Corby said that the Labour Party proposed a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Secretary of Labour and Pensions Smith of the shadow government stated that the party was "very clear" about their only opposition to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26 000 to £23 000.
Corbyn will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has encountered in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to policy and now tells us that he has 'enforced' ideas for the Prime Minister and received over 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, the representative of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's questioning hours is too conflicting and that he intends to refrain from both the cleverest of words and the squeezing, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Mr Corby has said that the shadow government's secretary-general, Angela Eagle, is acting as his deputy for Question Time when Mr Corby is not taking part - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also suggested that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, Mr Bercowi, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party.
When Cameron came to the top in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that is often linked to the Prime Minister's questioning hours, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since the launch of television broadcasting in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the leadership's discretion, his sub-room management, and his position with other representatives of the public, even though the critics have criticised the fact that they have become only a irritable image that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street schools have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless kids are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and gain a win.
BBC News met one of the first young people who graduated from the project.

The value of the pound increases as wages increase in the United Kingdom
Red value jumped up after numbers appeared to rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages and salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it an estimate of the increase in courses.
Punta rose by more than one per cent to $1,5505, and by 0.84 per cent to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed down to 6229.21 as the rise of 1.49 per cent.
SABMiller was the most distinctive market share and increased by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would bring together two world's largest pawns and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after a competitive luxury group from Richmond received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The Packing and Paper Group of Mond's shares were the largest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company announced half a year before its income from taxes: 83% increase to GBP 46.6 million.
According to JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage of employees is raised in the UK, it can mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs might be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer jobs.
Metcash is launching a grass-roots campaign against invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA shop from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Wholesaler of food products Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and West Australia before the $700 million attack by Aldi.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store in early next year to South and West Australia, with up to 120 stores coming. At the same time, Metcash and the IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and building IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Dunsborough's ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer taste in IGA's shops, and merchants sell discount tickets to Australian football matches for their stock customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesale food, alcohol and iron goods seller organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and West Australia make up almost 30% of the IGA sales area of Metcash, with profit margins higher than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
South and West Australian buyers are well-knownly cornered, with IGA dealers having a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the East.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will pick up about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first movements.
In its weekly report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million a year on sales and Metcash can lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south of 25 and in the west of 30 movements, generating revenues of 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and amounts at the base of Metcashi's high fixed expenses can cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA customers were the most loyal to all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share falls from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week's manager of the investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said on business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "probably lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comments.
It is understood, however, that Mr Metcash's board member would have contacted Douglas last week.
After 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the revenues from the food and food business activities of Metcash, which is selling products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations when pressure on sales and margins is on them.
However, wholesalers hold their own, and have invested more than $150 million a year every week to reduce the prices of hundreds of products to the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate their stores by increasing the rate of increase in fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Mr. Ian Morrice, Director-General of Metcash, says that the price calculation and the improvement of sales outlets have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered in the recent storm, which has been raging around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more credit than criticism of his own conduct, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Union.
Younger member of a talented double called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unintentionally exposed to a case where Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in a fire-fighting match in Cincinnati, the head judge had twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his mail after the Crampi ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unwavering defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth from another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi's just been pulled into his ass," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp because of the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, also in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little hard.
He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is trained firmly, is in good condition and is quite peaceful and mature a young man, and I think he should be judged according to his earnings.
Healy has also supported the decision not to participate in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a solution for all, but still supporting the canberraan return to the team's regular fishing.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all around [Cyrgios]", Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public thinking about these consequences.
European Immigration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of curbing the flow of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in an neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who fled from their homelands have now set up their tents and for an indefinite period of time set up between the inspection posts of two countries.
However, there was an increase in the absence of such a measure.
As the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared that it would be impossible to "accept" the return of migrants from Hungary, when more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause damage to civilians.
The debate is due to take place in the near future with other countries and Brussels", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, a mixed occupation arose following the failure of the 28-nationalisation group at the controversial meeting of the Common Immigration Policy in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they hoped to talk about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next week on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday’s emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed down and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that, now that the fence at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence against Romania in order to stop the flood of immigrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agate reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finalise the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and place of entry for refugees from the European Union, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and from elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not non-war refugees, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define the company as a crime exceeding or damaging 4 metres (13 feet) of barbed wire, built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"As a result of the situation of mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency situation," said Zoltan Kovacs, the government's news officer, told journalists in southern Szeged city.
We are very clear on the matter: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
While Parliament must continue to formally accept the military stationing expected for next week, Associated Press journalists at the border have for days seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban's Homeland Security Adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 more lands.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the border with Serbia after they had sent a cable-covered train wagon to close one of these locations.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal box for people to handle and the crowds sought to intrude.
About 20 people got in, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they will refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership at Bernie Sanders has narrowed to half
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in double-digit leadership in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders will hold him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the electorate (counted at 58%), while Sanders second supports 27% (counted at 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential election, but he is in favour of 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-elections, most of the Democrats say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more strictly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the ranks of democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit chapter in the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters say that they are enthusiastically supporting Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
Fourthly, they say they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support him.
The attitudes are more confused with those who are not in favour of Clinton at the moment - only a fourth would enthusiastically support him.
While 48% of the democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republicans' first-man Donald Trump says, the same is true of the lesser Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in the open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has a suitable experience (16%). The most popular answers were that now is the right time for the women president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 %).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President has an impact on the potential candidate for President, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race already - although the third disagrees.
When asked who they would vote for the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton’s supporters, over half say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden starts out, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
At this level, Biden stays far away, but the share of those who hold him to vote has grown.
When asked what was most important about the candidate, democratic voters, however, put their opinions ahead of the vote.
Also last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered as an impossible candidate for these voters.
The candidates of the Democrats or potential candidates will be very successful in certain key areas among the voters of their parties.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's most capable of three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democrats say that Clinton is not being honest and reliable, which is twice as high as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they don't have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally feel that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When we look at all these things, about a quarter of the Democrats say that they do not have an opinion about Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server as a foreign minister continues to raise questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanations and say that it did not affect their general opinion.
However, it is different when we see America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanations, and only about a third are satisfied.
People’s views were divided in March soon after the daylight came.
Most Americans say that e-mail politics did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has changed worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not being honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of all registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trumpi to be honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trumpi are considered good leaders.
Six candidates from the study, Biden, Carson and Bush, are considered the most honest.
As a rule, Sanders is considered to be honest, but many have no opinions about him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trumpi in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the foot.
Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27 % of the poll published on Tuesday by the CBS's poll on last month's Fox News election statement.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is well on the way with different demographic groups and is taking off from Trump's senior Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasichia. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker’s support has fallen the most: from 10 percent to the current 2 percent last month.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error for this latest survey of 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6 per cent.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson to be on the rise in the polls: he has 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32 percent.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity increased last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's belief.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of Baruch College's first year student
Almost two years after the student died in a fraternity simulation ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
Members of the Baruch College Pi Delta Psi in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his hospital stay, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back loaded over a 13-pound bag full of sand, after which he was repeatedly beaten to the ground when he tried to walk through the frozen field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head would get hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the fraternity didn't call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search for information about his symptoms online, and contact the national president of the fraternity, Andy Mengi, asking for this advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner told at the press conference.
"In this section, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Chief of Police Wagner said.
Deng wasn't made to work, and he died the next morning.
According to the body opening protocol, Deng received repeated blows on the head, body and thighs of a dull object.
"There have been too many families suffering from brotherhood, when at least one student died annually since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is an important step.
Monroe County's grand jury argued that the first five members were charged with a third-degree murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent embezzlement and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held responsible only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind the event that accepted the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held responsible," Wagner said on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College denied the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke out its connection to the local department.
This happens when the US central bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates is coming, and the market for rising rates is falling, bond yields are rising and the economy is having to decline.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long this will take or how long it will last.
The past does not give much help in terms of timing, especially in terms of the economy.
The recovery has sometimes lasted only 11 months after the first recovery, sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the officials of the United States Central Bank have so emphatically stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the trend towards normalisation of the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants may find that all the interest rate-related fraud has been overstated.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis in the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the 'quite money' era," said Capital Economics's main economic expert, Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, is a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Below is an overview of how some of the economic components will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last month or so, the expectation of an increase in interest rates can make the situation even unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital is tending to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a recent survey of what is happening after the central bank increase.
In other words, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, about 14% rising, 250 days after the increase, the situation is fairly stable (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles 14.4%, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, a leading capital strategy for Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the upswing cycle when the income starts to fall.
The recessions are part of economic life, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the Central Bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is in particular the gross domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest level of all time before the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 increases since 1950 in nominal annual GDP have only twice been less than 4.5%.
While in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
The rise in interest rates in this fragile financial regulation may be risky and raise the question of "is this time different", Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have reserved for the Bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, future trade is only expected to have a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all cycles of upturn have so far occurred in supercycles where GDP has passed its peaks very quickly since recovery began," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from a recession that has been the worst in the observation period.
In today's cycle, the central bank has been overly waiting for the longest ending of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months ahead.
Fixed returns have also been unstable in the market awaiting interest rates, and the model reminds some of the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of debt securities yields appears to change immediately with the first cycle increase/cut.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on debt securities will fall immediately," said Deutche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that raising interest rates will lead to a convergence of income from longer and shorter-term debt instruments, thus balancing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for a profit," said Kathy Jones in an analysis of Schwab's fixed-income analyst.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the more stringent outlook on monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the rate of return is evener, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt are worse off when the dollar increase makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the post-interest rate period of the first three months," Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their customer-oriented report.
Companies with strong net sales passed the weak net sales by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with a high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than those with lower quality companies, with the first average being 4 percentage points and the latter 3 percentage points.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock exchanges, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also benefit from higher profits, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "nationalism"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor is becoming more and more difficult
In addition, he received the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just matching the Brit Awards
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticises The Voice, saying that it is not even original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into a Classic FM, claiming the leading representative of the public, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not do.
The Executive Director Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an effect on its content and that it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "nationalism" - is turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also took over the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"Last year, the BBC Music Awards will only seem like a different name from the Brit Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples I remember about when, in fact, you just copied something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its commercial partner in terms of live music and information sharing for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things about classical music, which I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is in fact first class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Head of Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer, which was criticised for coming to the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Conservative Tory Party representative Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimated to be £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is in any way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, with Paloma Faith and Boy George acting as star judges, was produced in the "most BBC style".
He added that he wants a production company "to find success within his own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice periods, or to order that the money of the creditors be used for other entertainment forms.
Web sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month the rise was the lowest after the beginning of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many British shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, the experts say that there are now signs of a levelling down of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only 5% increase last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a flattening of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," said Andy Mulcahy, JMG sales index supplier, Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales became stronger when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is flattened, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slow down trades.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the usual average of five times more buyers flocked to their computers to pick up shops, throwing down many merchant websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made buyers argue about the discoveries, can control the purchase
The study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five of them were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping stores.
Muslimit burys the dead in Meka's crane accident, Bin Laden's family with consequences.
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funerals in Meka
Saudi Arabia has partly been accused of the collapse of the building shed in Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed
29 The dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the girdle fell down in Mecah.
In the main, the grieving whites filled the route to honor the first dead who made their final trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad passage passed by the holy place where only a few days ago the crane fell through the mosque’s roof and destroyed worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the construction of the Bin Laden family to be guilty of a disaster that also injured 394 people.
29 corpses were carried through the streets by the worshipers who killed the cranes in the Great Mosque of Meka.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram and his parents had been in the great mosque before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue when thousands of people arrive continually in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision published by the State-run Saudi Press Agency, it was said that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it stated that the company's leaders are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out what caused the crash in the courtyard of the Grand Cup, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements regarding the collapse of sufferings and has not received any comments from its representatives.
The Royal Decree also accused the Alliance of not using up-to-date protective devices and did not cooperate with the meteorology authorities.
There are tens of cranes around the Meka massif, which are part of the huge building robbery led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades and it leads major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned it in the 1990s.
In wind and rain, the rumour happened only days before millions arrived in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim should do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rial of GBP 174,000 to be paid to the families of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured get half of this money.
The B&Q boss says that the workers working cheaply in Eastern Europe are in favor of it.
The British are increasingly using helpers' services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, a total of 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Rupert Steiner, City’s Main Letter to Daily Mail
The British are said to give up the hammers and landslides and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repair work.
It seems that if you're smart with a hammer or hit the walls to paint, you're in the minority now.
The British are increasingly hiring helpers to do their own tea work in their homes, says the head of a company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new Kingfisher, who owns the home-represent chain of trade, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is popular and that they are offering their services at their blasphemy prices.
This results in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Srawfix trade for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more than one woman’s households that do more housekeeping work than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to strike a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who are leading the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his management team in such a way that it has equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with 50 per cent equal to women, including its Director General and Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important matter here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women on the board."
Kingfisher reported the invoice in both half a year's earnings and sales after the group took the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, the Kingfisher owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new moves
The three-stage government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the broad mental expression of the workers.
A lot of people feel that there is reason at that time too.
Well, let's see if it's worth it when it's bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to report that they are not going to participate in the mental exercise but are going to work.
At an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no web where to protest, but the open declaration of blasphemy would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of trade unionists in a few tens of thousands of people do not protest very quickly, but the reason for thinking is that it gives.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of Ay's activity, the government's raw solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years now, when things seemed to be rolling on their own weight, the unions are finally making it possible for them to defend their rights, to be visible and to be able to do so properly.
Thus, the government may wish to perhaps capture the role of the Ay movement, once membership of the union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Let us take whatever we think about the activities of the organisations, it is a mess that Friday's mentalisation would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is continuing to decline and unemployment is rising.
I think these things are making everybody's head come on.
The University of Lappeenranta's high savings envelope: Targeted at 8.5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings period with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the University's savings strategy, negotiations will start for the entire staff, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 employees.
In addition, the other two million will be saved.
The YT negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
In this financial period, the university will achieve a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The expenditure will grow slightly next year, but funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction of corporate funding in our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trusted persons will be launched next week on Tuesday and will be governed by the law for six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland’s railways
Onnibus owner of Halpabus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest rail companies," Souter says.
Rail is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first one is the local transport of the Capital Region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-distance traffic in turn after the near-traffic.
Souter is already telling us that he's approached the Ministry of Transport.
Yle says the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus's plans.
Other international companies have reported interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
US Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is on the sidelines when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
When Mrs Reuters asked 80 economists a little more than half of those who still thought the central bank was raising interest rates last week, they now believe that the situation is still not resolved and that interest rates are kept at the current level of 0 to 0.25 %.
It is a historic event, for the central bank’s cutting interest rates to zero is seven years old.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, bringing billions of dollars into the balance sheets and creating little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore less rose global views.
It has warned the market that they must be ready to rise, but signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After shooting at his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting at his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "damaged" about the first murder and hoped that "it could be cancelled", said the authorities on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Delta State University's country science and social science teacher Lamb called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said "after killing his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "skin dog" in the house that "no one is bothering" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentis and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb, reading: "I'm so sorry I hope I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who's ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killed himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, to be sure, but there was something in Lamb's mind.
The authorities said on Tuesday that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Prentiss had believed he was with Schmidt, there was no "legitimate information or evidence" of any "trimiodrama".
Shawn O'Steen told me that she married Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "stuck."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "one of the best friends of all."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked at home online, and according to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentis.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lamb that his relatives called somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb's highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about educational science in Delta State in the spring of 2015, explains the CV on the University's website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires its tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture on his right leg when Manchester United disappeared for the PSV Eindhoven in the Battle of the Master League.
Although the defenseman stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play for this season.
The injury caused by Héctor Moreno's Héctor Moreno's holding deposit at 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw had plunged into the PSV area.
She was treated in the field for 9 minutes and had to give her oxygen before taking her to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture on his feet and he's now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on him.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing at the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
The divorce judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian operator was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged tack.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related issue: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to the PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championship in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everything is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Morenon's foot broke when he played on the Mexican team Van Gaalin against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this heavily, because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see the situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's score.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andres Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling had challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn something: if your child loves a book, he will not last long before he or she learns almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a vacation child care service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seussi's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron wrote on the SuperCamps website in a published message and continued: "Happy, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we haven't seen before."
All this is true, but the next song in which Cameron probably describes the book's story is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill out a rather short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win to the heart of her dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write by his right name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn't suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the Lorax plot on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with: "In Tarville, a city inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win over to the heart of his dreams for the Audrey girl."
Taking into account that Cameron is publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would have been so inexperienced in the book. In that young, anonymous son hears how local nature has destroyed the greedy, wood-scattering and necessary ticking Kerskanen, ignoring the story of a short, fictitious creature named Lorax, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR mission has probably been externalized to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text might have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received by Cameron's staff, but didn't comment at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the English team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think that the replay of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut down the guest profit from the bills.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but it includes good laps and a strong team thinking: they have no scars for 2012, only young positives.
Moeen Ali is developing in her orbit and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related to the subject: Adam Lyth dropped out of the English cricket team, and Alex Hales replaced him.
The decision to leave the Adam Lyth team must understandably be difficult to analyse for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good at attacks under challenging circumstances, and simple but harsh truth is that the critics are judged on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press, because, as I have said before, the players are the best players in the choice.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more running to Yorkshire, the second chance will come.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not perform just as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is primarily a team player.
It's hard to answer the question, how long will the hitter get a copy?
Lyth was chosen seven times in the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was chosen nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only reason for the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trotti first to the Caribbean when Lyth was at the top, but the lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hit I appreciate.
He's got a crooked player for something we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same chance as others before him, but this obviously depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen is alluded to next to Cook, where an extra feeder could be added to the field, but four fast ones could be held, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why you couldn't hit a fighter there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be a pretty crooked player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his Countship in Worcestershire, but he is three and there is little difference between them.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games on the first slow fall before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a thief in the team, and, little of what I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unadorned statistics, hitting average 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many feeders available, and the voters chose the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard increases on the coach side.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawarden as a consultant in games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along in the games of the white ball, bringing with him both energy and a ruthless flash.
I have always thought that he was born to be part of the international cricket, was then playing or training, and he has the same exploitative as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested on a one-day basis, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and pickers do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on the lightest grounds.
UK exit from the EU (Brexit) will be able to win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever greater problems every day, even though he does not take into account the hearty Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's choice of the Labour Party leadership or the European Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomatic colleague recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, which are not all due to it, some Member States have been tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions and disturbing contractual changes that these countries do not want to do in the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade unions' central organisation decided that it would not want them either if they were to reduce social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance will be late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, will take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local memorial, either with or without the local eye-catcher, and will then come home and say that they will win the supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the European Union - 'Don't leave us alone with France' - says of Berlin - proposes that the shortest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before he goes to ruin the same way as he did for too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Holland will be faced with a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a evasive force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, a leftist in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of the selfies, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend, some of these ministers can even plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations had been held" and "Renegotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
Europeans have had a hard time experiencing how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU-sceptic press sovereigns are, what they were not inspired by the 1975 referendum of Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was strengthened by the 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the largest Euroopportunist in Europe, who made a name for himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-seeking predators, telephone hacking foreigners, and people with a name for themselves elsewhere who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them the same way, but he realized that if you are in a cage with a greedy gorilla, the bananas must be abandoned because of the confusion, unless he wants to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blair than Blair himself, as far as the challenge of the renegotiation of Cameron is concerned, because Bair had accepted the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair the situation of exit.
The press never forgiven him for that.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly tapped me back in the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-examining Neil Kinnock's 80's boycott of the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it can take time, he still has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but undoubtedly with Andrew Marri, whom the BBC partner Corby left on Sunday.
The official status of Corbyn in Europe is, to be honest, evolving.
He says that he would like us to be permanently reformed in the EU.
Well, the majority of people outside the UK's independence party Ukip's war goal and the most terrible nationalisms in the Conservative Party can certainly put this opinion behind them.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said this on both radio and television this week when his internal patrolman would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint karsky John McDonnell the shadow government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party without, however, going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hilary's coating was more attractive.
But for the fight to stay in "anywhere" - the Benni statement - was not what Mr McDonnell said, nor, in conclusion, what Mr Corby told the heads and representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the disarray, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the 24-hour TV era, and in particular in social media whims, which is a useful growth platform for paranoids and frauds.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep his support for the Labour Party in the referendum campaign self-evident.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks that way.
But the fundamental rotation of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited, regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation with left-wing thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to the dogma of learning narcissism.
With regard to his two-way relationship with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), the foreign diplomats simply have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would Paris or Berlin be in favour of wasting political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed with the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Conservative government is in power to cut costs, as I was reminded at the British Influence Security Forum's launch on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England's electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that electric tobacco is 95% less harmful than traditionals originated from a meeting of 12 people, where some had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet’s criticisms of public health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
PHE published this 'virtual pillar' report last month, describing it as 'a comprehensive review of the evidence'.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to contacts between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical magazine Lancet published a editorial last month, which attacked the PHE's executive decision against the "extraordinary lukewarm ground."
Two other researchers in the BMJ have wondered if the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects the PHE's claim "according to the current best estimate that electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" to be based on detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a 12-person meeting that developed a multi-criteria decision-making analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reported to have previously received funding from the British American Tobacco company for an independent investigation.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting announced that they had received funding from the manufacturer of electric tobacco, but not the funding he was told to have received from Philip Morris International before.
The selection criteria for members of the Panel are not explained, but the panel includes a number of well-known producers of electric tobacco, some of whom also report on having received funding in the field of research.
Others on the scene are not known about their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco director also attended the meeting.
The group's research "explainably admits" that there is a lack of "undisputable evidence of harm in most products and most criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell argue that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence to date that electric tobacco is used as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that the allegations made in the BMJ have been answered before.
He says, "Electrical tobacco is much less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lives die from their dependence.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance of the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die from an illness related to smoking each year, while smoking costs NHS 2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if electric tobacco is not safe, its disadvantages are just a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
The former Channel 4 president, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "take whatever" on such slows as, for example, this soap series on the Albert Square street.
Johnson said that licensing fees should only be used for programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting programmes in the public service that are likely to have a smaller audience, more difficult times of broadcasting than competitors and channels such as the BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organizations, Johnson said that he initiated Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea of the BBC producing and sending programs that would clearly suit non-subvented competitors," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its research into the BBC's future.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important broadcast time because it wants to gather as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The voice is one of those and EastEnders the other, without denying within the house realized.
To be honest, other channels would give anything of it.
I don't understand what it's like to have a public service broadcast.
I don't think it'd weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010, serial entrepreneur Johnson said that the BBC is responsible for hunting viewers "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC’s most popular series, reminding former Sky’s leader Tony Ball of his comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes "are going to the BBC4 where the number of viewers is often not measured, but the BBC thus meets its responsibility and then, in the hypocrisy of defending GBP 4 billion, is able to say that 'of course we are doing all these unknown programs that nobody sees'."
They'll put them on a mission where no one will ever look at them.
Concerning the licence fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to look for a more regressive system in which to get the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that USD 150 a year is worth a lot, but I don't know if that's true for the people with whom GBP 150 is big money, because they don't use the BBC much.
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reassess its current mission of "information, training and entertainment" in Reith.
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australia and Canada's radio and change the form of "information, education and entertainment".
As for the partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said would only be shown on television, and join commercial companies in such a way that they could all be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the shock absorbers change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have raised worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them with sound waves.
The small bursts of shuttles change direction as soon as they hit a sound pulse that is too high to hear from the human ear.
Impulses work by switching genetically modified motion cells with film channels that react to ultrasound exposure.
Related topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people's brains are led by electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shock absorbers do not normally react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with small microscope bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves, which then enter the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures in some worm cell cells.
Sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the attached cells, says the report published in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled shock absorbers, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that part of their motion cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified mats, the microphones confirmed the sound waves and passed them on to the mats where they connect the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must send optical fiber along to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobtrusively, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that genetic therapy and therapeutic virus can make it possible for human nerve cells to react at once to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and cells producing insulin, he added.

Advertising may disgrace the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-aircraft video.
Horrible killer machines!
Cars that crush the ankles!
The grape bombs!
And electric bending tubes that cause painful pain but do not leave behind!
There is no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest trade fairs is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International in order to emphasize the British Government's willingness to trade arms for the repression governments at the ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard area.

As a result of a separate campaign, there were also many posters for bus stops and metros, which require more detailed access.
"Important information, do you travel on the DLR route from 15-18 September?" together, you will be asked using the London underground font and brand, when the DLR track turns into a tank image.
In this September, a bunch of gun dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the arms trades.
These 300 posters are by artists who worked at the Banksyn Dishaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Plans).
The collective called the Special Patrol Group helped to spread posters around London using Ad Space Hack Packs packages, which include six-pound packages of six-inch keys, which, according to the collective, "take a third of the entire planet's bus stop advertising space".
Transport for London has not been pleased with this unauthorized "publicism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and head of the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside audiences in galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists on their resistance when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greets people on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over the last 24 hours more than 100,000 times via Facebook. It was created for free by VCCP, and also the graphic designer and the background browser worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever found that there was no advertising at all of the station trade shows - and there was no point in the ExCeL calendar then too - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of the obscure corporation, but "it was more likely to stop it with bright colors and animation".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment that is sold at trade fairs," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art associated with the exhibition comes from the inside of ExCeL, when the exhibitors are selling fantastically decorated products.
In his press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the U.S. Army for the "AT4CS RS" launch from his shoulder.
This includes "the unique pipe mounting tip that targets excellent effects behind the tank inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student residence when I was 19 and I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the powerful smiles of people I've been irritated by - and numerous long complaints of others.
Much of my learning can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving into the dormitory can be anything that goes to the nerves that is completely scary.
It's attractive to snort: to tell you where you are from, did you like the space and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a yeast extract from HAHAHA me to find me in my room."
Breathe.
And also help others to draw the spirit to ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you to find those people you like, not those you don’t want to talk about even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’re sharing extinguishers.
Give people room.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie venues, and luxury entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.

The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but many dorms consist of a room-to-room culture that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I consumed when I was talking to you".
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and perhaps send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
I mean, knocking when I got a speech, knocking.
A guy in my student residence thought that if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you're starting a university with a breadmaker's peak season, knocking people's doors with a chocolate dish and presenting yourself seems a bit less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to become friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and may be that they will later combine your face with a surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk.
It's quite possible that they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to look at it more than my roommate who mixed up detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You're not supposed to be so noisy that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverb's bat calling the catula.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play drum and bass less, because she had three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting their own music to rest, locked their doors and went to a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, in turn, it wouldn't be incredibly awkward if you were to have a roommate as your future spouse, you would be fighting together, you would resign, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot partner is really not your future spouse, you could even try to talk sense into your bottom head.
In the exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the limit between stickyness and bullying is slimmer than it seems.
It's a good trick, but it's a good one. It's a good one, but it's a good one.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something... but never mess with someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys to the water glass, which you put in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling like twice.
Racist attack on foreign students' dormitory in Kitee - The house planned to become a reception centre was tainted in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia, at the shelter for foreign students.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors but the dormitories of foreign students who have already lived longer in Finland, says Kite’s teacher of the Gospel People’s School Heidi Luukkainen.
The National College's windows and walls were engulfed with racist signs, such as scavengers, and a metal object had been thrown through a window in one of the accommodation spaces, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Lukeinen, who was responsible for youth social security education at the National School of Education, the building that was the target of violence had an estimated 10 people at the time of the attack.
"Being a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luke says.
There are people from 12 different nationalities who are housed at the National School.
They are already students who had been in Finland for some time and are still seeking asylum from minors.
All those who have been involved in the building have an a-story.
Part of the study is in adult education, part is in vocational studies and part is in Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to an outsider who has already been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police investigate the attack as an act of injury and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Lukeinen, on Monday there was a briefing for students, including the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic around here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had several decades of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," Luke says.
Luke says it's been cleaned out of the walls.
As perpetrators, at least three men were suspected to have been involved and had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the tip of the youth's weekends when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious about it," Luke says.
Salo has also been tainted at a hospital that has been planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
That's what MTV told me on its website on Tuesday night.
The hospital's wall had been drawn by a swindler and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected by the police for incorrect information about the age and status of the residents of the building.
The state will stop the Y-train for Karelia, the passengers in their messes, the "weird idiot countries"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Karelia stops going in March.
The news shocked passengers arriving at the start of the train at Helsinki main train station.
In particular, the descent strikes the wingers, said Torbjörn Bengtström, resident in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the number of people living in the city is growing, and people working at work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
On the interview video of HSTV, Bengtström says that he will come to the capital, even on a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place in other New Zealand countries.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry is purchasing train services during the next contractual period.
The contract period varies year-on-year and the routes to be closed are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Sigtström believes that the state train driver is a short-sighted activity.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance on top.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raaseporians and the Bontians, because it is fast and bypasses multiple stations.
From the Espoola, the fate of people travelling beyond the city area was compromised by Annina Pöyry on the train.
"It's very sad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y-train.
It's a little bit easier.
It is likely that there will be a new train connection on the track, replacing the Y-Bahn in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonumm.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and for their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to find different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, the Ministry much more so.
The R line on the main track is missing two stops.
Instead, the number of trains is doubled in Ainola and Sauna Kalli.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are stopped throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the Pieksäki-Status route.
Train stops are reduced on the routes to Riihimaki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made on the stop-over journeys, with approximately nine million trips in total purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state 12.3 million annual savings.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital Currentity: "Marxin supports familiarity"
The global economic crises have put on the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusions published in 1867-1894 on Capital, writes in the book Yrjö Hakanen, known as SKP's former president, today, the topicality of Marx's Capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion are becoming increasingly widespread in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the increasing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakanen is also available from Aalto University professor, a respected economist Sixten Korkman.
In Korkman's book, Marx writes that he is "new and eternal".
However, is the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Delegation of Industry not Marxist?
No, not at all.
Korkman tells us on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and writer.
"The common idea is that the history of the idea tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early course of capitalism, Korkman considered.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The more relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, Marx’s concerns are being discussed, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical transformation," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx, is not helpful.
He thought capitalism was an hopeless case that should just end.
Yet Marx is in favour of Korkman's idea of familiarity.
"In the '70s Marx could not read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyites and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx too can approach without the ideology and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the armed forces in Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamils of war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka estimates that at least 100,000 people are dead.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, in the last few months of the long war, a major attack by the armed forces should be properly investigated, the UN report called for.
Sri Lanka’s Armed Forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a United Nations court because of foreign judges.
In the Yo test in England, social media score
The autumn high school writings had a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was in English.
More than 16,000 test children tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it might have been possible to write about social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article in the 150-250 English language could point to the magazine’s book keeper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to look at things from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects for which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates third subject in Porvoo, Swedish-language high school English teacher Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was really nice.
It had to write a fire speech, why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "the way normal".
The test in Finnish or Swedish provided answers to questions about texts such as adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the test will be done by another Finnish, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In readings, the test is organized normally, i.e. the mental expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Board of Students urges the experimentors to search for suitable traffic links in time to get to the trial.
Additional time may also be given if it can be shown that the delay was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed Wednesday morning in the district of Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes and his face in a cover-up command pipe.
He's normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money to catch him.
They're investigating it as a serious robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The mental expression resisting the government's surgery decisions will clog the city centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Ava and STTK alliances will meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the mental exercise.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothing of the giant atmosphere.
The roads leading to the railway gate will be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 a.m. to 14 p.m.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniem traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction from Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki police station, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on the police's work-related issues.
According to Kujala, Helsinki has support parties from elsewhere in Finland coming to Helsinki for mental expression.
The exact number of patrols the police don't tell us.
"Something is coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic storm extends from Hakaniem to its nuclear centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning to early morning.
With demonstrators arriving from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of order buses coming.
They're not allowed to go to the Iron Tent.
The buses are, in principle, quite far away.
The final trip must then walk to the demonstration site", Kujala says.
Mental expression also stops Helsinki public transport.
From the point of view of the police, this is a positive side.
The question of traffic flow, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of the people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the expression have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of the economic policy of the government in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to go smoothly.
People are usually employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, the Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local expressions are also held on Friday across Finland.
Friday's expression of mind is exceptional in many ways. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great mental expression organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siisaisainen, Professor of Sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Sisaisinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is missing in contract law.
Here is a lot of evidence that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's moods.
The new is now the sharp division of the mental expression of which the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed, who met in different parts of Finland, expressed their opinion in the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If we look for a point of reference for Friday's mental expression, it could be a giant display of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Siisainen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai collected 20 000 unemployed.
The Esko Aho (central) government is collapsing from crisis to crisis in the labour market.
It was said that the differences between the Finnish Government and the employee organisations had never been as bad as they were in the Aho mayor’s government.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse than at the time of Murrostorsta.
Moreover, Finland's very bourgeois government is now in power, Siisaisainen says.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so narrowly right-wing despite the speeches of the basic Finns.
At that time, there were some elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
Mental noise also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres as well as schools.
Even if mental expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have taken place annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful, even though in recent years practices have become more difficult.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is legal.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisäinen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The religion of the protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared for pig shit.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes on, among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
The strike of the metalmen took place in 70,000 metalmen.
The strike was interrupted with the introduction of the settlement board after seven weeks of strike.
Metal men received a 16% wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electrical strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom had become lowly unemployed, met in the House of Representatives to express their views on the job.
Firemen broke down three months in 1998
The firefighter's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police came to the egg market in 1994 when farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the slogans.
To Spain, farmers caught tons of snow.
The European Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn haysticks in front of the meeting place.
Nurses stopped in 1983 and 1995
The nurses stopped for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike marked a number of deaths during the strike.
The Tehy threatened the strike and the mass deportation of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass disengagement ultimately boosted negotiations.
Doctors stopped in 2001
"Doctors in the strike - forced," included the strike of the strikers in 2001.
The strike by local health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and resulted in a lively debate on how the strike could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for help in resolving the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck at Aisterheim near the German border carrying 42 refugees.
There is no information as to whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility is on the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the Austrian Public Radio, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company operates in restaurants and its CEO is a foreign-based, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
I've got an escape captain, a former drug courier, a pervasive businessman, five smugglers' story.
The king of crooked smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-looking taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, working at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and these "clients", and their book Death Travel Office appears in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the trunks of human trafficking, make suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers from different business portals.
HS is presenting five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading for the summer celebration.
For their location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which is part of Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more productive in transporting people.
That is what Emir has done on a blue, ten - foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat fills up, it can accommodate 40 people.
One of the trips Emir earns about EUR 8 000 after the expenses.
Emir has five helpers looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the island of Kerkenna.
Emir will stay them in empty houses for as long as you can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer is out of money, it is their problem.
We're leaving for the water at midnight for a cut-off.
On the first night you drive off the island, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes it's hard to go to sea, and passengers weep and throw up on a 20 - meter high platform.
The human child has been bitten in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants her to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the hangovers to death.
He says in the book that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim on the nearest island.
"I caught customers individually from the neck and threw them over the edge," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear his compatriots are gonna have to abuse this.
I'll get rid of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
A regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovað, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and otherwise it's seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, mainly for families.
In the middle of the forests without their families, men travelling without a family are staying in tents, flats and abandoned cars, which is now what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families also live in the forest who have not, for reasons or other reasons, left an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossings and week-long walks in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When they finally reach the territory of Bogovaða, a major humane transport hub, people are dying.
Goran's Kyytians are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he tells us in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get a tink.
That's not what Goran likes.
That's funny, that's silly, that's silly, all the way.
For example, 300 euros will be agreed first, then they will count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes being a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he is working cheaper than others and that he is spending only EUR 50 per person at the Hungarian border.
It's three hundred miles away, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a large amount for the smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his riders one kilometer from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and hurries away.
♪ In the work of mercy ♪
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Envoy, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where a lot of believers flee from the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Messenger runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the rubber band of white calves is elegantly cut under the low belt of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his ground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and beyond Europe.
At first, the customer calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it is advisable to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money visually, and to plunge in with the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain an asylum seeker or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that it is from, for example, the northern Kivu war zones and that it has had to escape from home violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It will help the Messenger's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum search procedure, to the NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He charges every step separately: the application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, in a European country of EUR 4,500-7 000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom's an initial smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irish man on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver, and ten truck drivers who do not necessarily even know they are in a humane transport business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the city centre of Calais.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison to organise illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
The cab stops, Tom runs his customers over the highway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck. We have to make sure that it's on its way to England and not, for example, to Holland, and cut off the protective guard.
It's got to be done quietly so the driver doesn't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the tow is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in an aluminium foil, the same thing that is being wrapped in the kitchen around a roast or oven potato.
It should prevent police thermal scanners from spotting a hidden person.
Some use ice filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client's truck and leaves the place hoping that he won't be driving a scumbag of lightning passengers, at least before Britain.
King of secret carriers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous transport companies.
An uppoverty Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the unquestionably king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçük has been developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only asks for the money.
One of the new methods is the illusion of luxury: Turkish ports are rented out for a few days on tourist routes to the American or European families.
In reality, ships are being loaded in full from Syria, Iraq, Kurds and Afghans, transporting EUR 5 000-7 000 against the payment from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers will be kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until they leave.
People are trapped in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Navy can only observe how deeply the ship swims, because other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers eject and throw up, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 from one of the luxury trips after the costs.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but hires captains, recruits, guards, roommates and other smaller agents to do the work for himself.
During the summer, transport is arranged for at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought cover companies across the country, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently he's gone.

American Olympic runners tell us in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times the new book Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter racer at the Olympic Games, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells us about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the race in peak condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead on a land run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power came to an end.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other competitors bypassed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself above the finish line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two - way mental disorder.
His brother Dan had made a year before the Sydney races for suicide, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money to have sex with foreign men.
He also oversold his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros per hour.
He tells me he's been using the money for his luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton’s prostitution was that he needed the same adrenaline peaks as he had won in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two - way mental disorder.
The double life of the former star racer came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the time of the world statistics 3.57,40, but stayed at the Sydney Olympics final.
The World Champion was delighted when the union put the Norwegian ski flower in control: "From the Great"
Norway's skiing queen Petter Northug has crossed the limits of convenience in the opinion of at least one of her colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have gone all summer and autumn as well as last year's Sports Agreement.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the conflict in the agreement, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put a ski flower in control.
"Thank you for pointing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active sportsman to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the country team for the entire season, so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations and will not give one athlete in the solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he convinced himself that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colours in the next season in the World Cup, as well as in the MM Games and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, including two gold medals.
He was involved in the team that won the message gold last winter in Falun.
The Sign Day of the Chicks also takes place in the North of Finland.
On Sign Day 25 September, a series of taps will be held in various restaurants and shops, to which the Signs of the Midwives have been awarded.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of Finnish food industry competence and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator are located around Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of an increase in the awareness of turtles and the organisation.
The day is organised in Vaasa in the restaurant Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the day of the shield takes part in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
Indeed, it has been decided to make an organization one of the most important international events to be held throughout the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kaurajoki newspaper: Law Chancellor of the establishment of the Kaurava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava property currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure for the crisis, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, Finland's Erillisnetkot Oy.
The Kaurajoki magazine states that the placement of a reception centre in the same building structure by a private person would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have an interest in the territory of the former London School and in the airport, the effect of which has also not been investigated when preparing the reception centre, is written.
The case states that for the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Minister of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the fundamental opposition of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned site in the former facility is wrong.
The gruesome city government was dealing with the reception center issue last Monday.
Subject: The situation of Syria in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The administration means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on the editors in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all Parliamentary Parties in their official residence in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He values the ability of the government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially the most fundamental issues.
Especially at these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the report, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the United States, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If it develops in a positive direction, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to have an impact on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the report, the NATO issue was also sidelined in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

The Office of Early Childhood Education will be pleased to inform you of any further changes in its activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Chick takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, a wide range of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not remain for the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered in Yle channels.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires the public to have television and radio talks.
This dossier, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and calls for a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The call will be sent to TV1 and Radio Finland at 9:05-21.20.
It can also be viewed in Yle Area.
The pepper takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general government turnaround.
Is it an attempt to strengthen the right to define a public debate and to refuse public debate on questions?
The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and that he does not allow himself to be defined.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related to each other.
The Koivunen understands that commercial media is agitated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not notification issues in democracy.
It is up to the media representatives to try to ensure that policy agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuen, the TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more we've heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are more than the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Generally take a risk in this sense if it is not a special situation, but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a communication between politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or public interest.
A smart bet from a pip
In the future speech of Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media researcher.
Tonight we should look at exactly where Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the six, the TV talk is a clever call from Sipila, because this is how this brings out one's own views without noises.
This will give the public a message without a journalist filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media might misinterpret something about the speech, because there are no specific questions to be asked.
According to the 6th, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV... that sweat flows, that hands shake.
He compares the Siple to the father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do his job well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to inform us of something, because this person is as if talking directly to another person.
Such (United Kingdom President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
Very exceptional
Policy researcher Erkka Railo regards the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens as truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades when the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathize with the pressures ahead.
On Friday, employee organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against government action.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announced that he would challenge the Sipilä dialogue.
There's no time for monologues.
It's been almost six months since the election.
You can't hide the rest, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time of the discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Finnish Internal Police Department also confirms the case to Iltalehti.
The boy left to play out at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that night, no longer got in touch with him.
Dad thanks all those people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times that's incredible in such a short time.
Finnish star UFC disappointed with the violent ferocity of young people: You can create hatred
A Kurdish freelancer, Makwan Amirkhani, published a video on Facebook calling for a migrant background for young people in particular.
Mr Amirkhani made a heavy statement against the street campaigns of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived with her family in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells us that he received a message asking him to check out a Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account in which young people fight for extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells us that she is disappointed with the young.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other, and without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people on the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to police commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, fighting videos for social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
Especially the fact that you're fighting on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani recalls that in Finland there are sites that seek the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very serious.
A little hard, boys, no more defending you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhani calls on young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become a target of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go in there, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a source of concern for racism.
You're gonna have to do something that I don't like.
By the way, you've got things pretty bad, and that's not going to get any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, says that the employee organisation will consider its position on the STTK's alternative savings list on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity target required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Akava's president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will adopt the proposal if SAK, Mr STTK and Mr Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that SAK, the largest employee organisation, soften its previous position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, in turn, made a brief comment on the subject on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that, in addition to the mandatory laws, agreements between the active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off negotiations on the social agreement when SAK did not agree to commit to a 5% productivity target.
Comment: The big-mouth show is threatening to grow up, "I think it's a little funny to put on a fist."
I think it's a little funny to put a fist on if there's a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
At the employee camp, the atmosphere varies from one side to another.
Is it intended to call upon the government to be overturned, or is it intended to agree with it?
On Monday, the presidents of the SAK broke out of holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be caught.
The man was also spreading to the acaves.
The OAJ threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or nursery is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of the STTK, Antti Palola (sd), took a peaceful stand.
He announced that he had been in contact with the government and that he had drafted an alternative presentation called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) to be a 5% productivity measure.
Sture Fjäder (Kok), President of Akava, hastily announced that his agreement is already in place.
At first, SAK's office didn't belong to any of them.
It is difficult for President Lauri Lylyn (sd) to agree when the leaders of the Union just on Monday told us to put the country on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will look for solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to give rise to a joint proposal by employees, the SAC should tend to accept a 5% productivity measure as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK is in good relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola's right hand, the head of the STTK's social impact, Jukka Illus previously served as a special assistant to Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhainen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola defined that the government's ay skills have improved all the time.
A coincidence or not, but the exit of Palola took a little clean away from the standers of Finland, whose bowling image shrouded by Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
I think it's a little funny to put a fist in your pocket if there's a paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Etyj Meeting in Helsinki.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, believes Mongolia is better than Finland's OSCE host.
In Mongolia’s capital, Ulan Bator has begun the sitting of the Ethyj Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Day.
In that case, Finland did not allow the arrival at the meeting of the Russian politicians who have been forced into the European Union, such as the Naryshkin, - a matter on which the President pointed out to journalists.
Our estimate was that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, according to Interfax's news agency, Naryshkin emphasized.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he had been denied access.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complicated, so Naryshkin continued his squeezing of Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for its "serious organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will be conducted constructively and with positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok), who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff point: "Paints tight"
Killer and Lock will continue today in Hakamets for bull days, while both will be on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets there are no real goalkeepers.
Last night, the killer went to Kuopio, digging for a three-to-two continuation win in KalPa.
The rise was male, because last season's silver team was worst off two goals of defeat.
Lock's Tuesday was more muddy.
The visitors of Blues, who started his catch in a coat, had round zero points, and the losses were also 2-3.
A tough game, you score tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, the Lock Attack Janne Lahti anticipates the settings of the company's pages.
The killer has formed a pretty heavy playoff for the traumatists.
In fact, in the past two years, the killer has just dropped into the gap in the final series of the Luko.
On both levels, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara got up in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
The two cashiers who have been rejected yesterday will be given a swing shift today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Visible: Just running a crappy play
Sports director Voivola has written a follow-up to Chief Coach Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film, where he played the main part.
As a sensationalist, the baseman put a tough line of struggles on Apollo Creed, the world champion.
Rocky had a great deal of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Voivola edited Pori's restless ashtray.
The nameless and woody fasting progressed to an astonishment for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough subjects like Rocky.
It was White Indian, Por Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquoise.
The wishing child became a blonde.
A great TV seller, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
You took the winning silver.
Wishing was one of the heroes.
Written by W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W.W.
A man who works as a former sports manager has built a dam on the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have hit guys in the neck like Rocky pigs at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamä, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kupariinen are due to be in something other than a wreathing game.
The wish has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI will be Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed into Rautakalli's Sean Connery.
Iron calibre is a clumsy part of Rocky's manuscript that Connery had in his original 1976 work.
There's nothing in the iron shed but Rocky. It's a nickname.
The game philosophy of the iron mine does not include rushing and small-scale hunting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different to play a hard game than a pig.
In the last season, the German Garret Stafford caught the Killer Jere Karelia in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Calli put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve even minutes!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game, and it's not part of an acecheque, and after the game, the iron caliper was hot for the Hundred Nation.
The team of this season has been strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops and escalators.
There are no key men in practice in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, as Mr Rautakalllio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface, it's getting worse.
The year 1953 Iron calibre is known to be interested in the transition to a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The recent balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the losses of the 1-6 goal line.
Wishing would not have been a good idea to write a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm in a movie with my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it seems crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temone laugh.
He has been married to Apulana's ex-baset and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting for the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulana's "Teet of the Beauty" film is the mother of a drummer, Sipe Santapuki, Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, although this father Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirk, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted the role for me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
Sirka has helped so much.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirk also understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that the Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a paralysed and very bitter.
There was a pretty little probability that someone really would succeed, but Sira had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard from Tuuka a lot about this youth even before the film plans.
But the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s bad-known bowl.
Olga was an everyday and nice girl who wouldn't have anything to do with Tuuka.
At the highest, he could have hidden himself in love.
Olga says he's been working with Tuuka so much over the past 10 years that a big joint project isn't scary.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple who live there often plan to drive home for the night because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only asking what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to a more expensive Finnish drama film
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film by Timo Vuorensola is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
The sequel of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been at the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation also goes beyond Iron Sky 2, since the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's film and Tero Faramaa's film starts in October in Antwerp near AED Studios and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scared.
I've been really sick for a while!
I have such a relaxed manuscript because I know exactly what kind of film should come from.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to be shown to the audience in this movie, she tells the newspaper.
Initially, the film budget was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the manuscript developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big pile too.
However, 100 million could be spent on the film, as each corner of the picture and its effects are so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight that it's not loose at all.
The film’s production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond this Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate will be determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The trendsetters' breasts have recently decorated large logos.
Another time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a huppard or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a junta.
But times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as is often the case before, the line between funny and trendy is staggering: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the standard core trend, i.e. the fashion of fashion, in which the trendettes surprised by favoring as much boring basic clothing as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now you place on the top of the grey base collar instead of the top of the cabinet already buried on the top of the shirt, in front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas's identifiable trams, favorite team game shirts and New York Yankees have made a return ticket.
The edges of the jeans are starting to mock the Calvin Klein logos of the alkatris are now cool details.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the chest of Versace’s censors makes it clear what sign of clothing is involved.
Would you be ready to present your logos while you're wearing them?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I haven't been stuck in the tank for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, the leading producer of Russian war industry products, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media have spread colorful arguments that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove large-scale Zotovian tankers for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook pages, he published a picture where he seems to be looking at the impact of a armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, on the basis of those images, it is not a question of getting stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start by saying that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was the BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel, I've served in the Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out in peace. Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's TV channel Zotov expressed his admiration at the exhibition's new technology in Russia because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I loved our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I'm absolutely going to go to all the tanks and all the assault wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the typewriter who wrote about it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and I came out.
I'm tall and rotting, but nothing like that that I'd be stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba's novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photograph of the alleged arrest has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show during a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Blonot.ru case, where Zotov was told about his poaching out of the tank when he tried and finally threatened to shoot everyone around him, unless he gets caught.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up issue in which the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
All they're used to is the soldiers jumping out of the armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company, has had a leak.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from its so-called rich-shine basin.
According to the company, measures have been initiated to correct the leakage.
The pool contains neutralised enriching water and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped for re-use as process water or directed through the surface treatment field to the environment in accordance with the permit.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak furnace meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The other ingredients did not flow to the environment.
The bleeding was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been found to cause leakage to the dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danken Kuuppaski: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the IMF is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation struggled with structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the entire contractual system and in the case of unemployment insurance.
Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuuppainen says that structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of positive message from the government's action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be too cut.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, which Kuoppamäki says to the Economic Survey.
In the IMF's view, the growth projects would also be useful if they were to be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danke predicts today in his new economic forecast that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention could be paid to industry's weakened confidence or to other so-called softer meters.
However, there is only a small percentage of the decimals involved.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who was working under Satoru Iwata for cancer, started her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told us on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata responded to the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as potential successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow the footprints of Iwata, and is assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is seen to be to strongly involve Nintendo in mobile games, but so that it does not eat bread on the company's traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are coming to Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country have disappeared every year.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens News have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kandelama, Director of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is Finland the same situation?
How much of the applicants disappear "under" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made in Finland for asylum of a minor who arrived alone.
They're missing 9.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the course of the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be of full age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, asylum seekers in Finland had a total of 3651, of which 134 had been declared to have disappeared because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from minors alone.
There are no overall statistics on minors who have lost this year, but therefore the number of minors has been known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons.
What happens to those who have made the translation decision?
Are they also lost, for example, to the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Office, since the implementation of the translation decisions is the responsibility of the police, the Court of First Instance stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered people in the country.
He's taken action on this.
Speaking at the EU's internal ministerial meeting on refugees' issues, Orpo spoke about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland on Monday.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the machines
Due to illness, the equipment used by Timo T.A., who lost his ability to work in the media sector, for the television and radio productions of Mikkonen, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment in Huuto.net, which at the time was one of the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The first news about the online notification was the online magazine of the Nightmakasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the hands of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are people who are interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but it is also necessary for as long as there is some old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and studio designers, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Stormland home.
We can't take all the goods with us at all.
I've started to invent, and I've been looking at what kind of stuff is being handed over.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TVs and radios.
It is clear from the rest of the brain attacks that a man who has made a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which representatives visited the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to prun away from what you think is worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to extend their power action to Friday's atmosphere.
The original plan was to set up metro and tram services only for the Friday noise.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether or not traffic stops for the whole day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says the body is large in the field.
The operations of the night and the tides extort the drivers badly, so the government plans to cut the castles raise opposition.
The point is, however, that the fact that traffic is growing all day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stand on Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
VR reports that trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
On Friday, there will be neither short-distance nor long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to the stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain in the pit.
The members of the ACP are away from work on Friday mornings on Saturday mornings at 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by a superior force, the HSL journalist Pirkko Repo guesses.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly which bus trains go on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a large-scale presentation at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11 a.m.-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled when panic took hold.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cans against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought the clock was a bomb.
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, 14 years old in Texas, is arrested after the teacher had his own clock bomb brought to school.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to present his electronic entertainment output.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and eventually the situation ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention centre on handcuffs.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished by three days of school compulsion.
His father's case is in his rage and the American-Islamic Council will consider whether the case is yet another proof of Islamophobia in the United States.
Great Britain - Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of monarchy.
The criticism expressed by the press that is calling for justice has also been endorsed by representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has insulted the people, estimated by Labour-Citizen Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last year’s Memorial celebrated the British Air Force’s fight against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends its official statement on Corbynia and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided labour lines.
Especially among the representatives of the people are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity and the increase in public expenditure.
Today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear for the first time as a party leader in this House in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask for.
Cameron was on Twitter for the weekend on Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister referred to in his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a legal case
South Lake Minnetonka Police have been investigating the family murder in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
Five families were found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family’s father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting a shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed himself in the house garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for a visit and found a huge house on the side of the Short family's death.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Houses and Successful Business
The investigation into the case of the South Lake Minnetonka chief of police Michael Siitar is still underway.
The motive of the blood vessels is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribunen, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've been made from the company's 50 offers of purchases over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in that the Short family bought a helpful house from Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of the car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribunen, however, the family's father was waiting for the court case.
The successful test prep, offering various pre-emptive courses, had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to the Success Test Prepin, Short's site had not removed any pre-emptive comments, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribunen, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Water Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner three was awarded the Finnish horse owner’s month prize at the victualling event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on his honor table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.

A wonderful gesture from the NHL star, "the greatest gift made by the athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal children's hospital.
According to the Health News, this is the largest single donation of all time made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens one year ago with eight years and 72 million dollars.
So the amount of Subban's donation is significantly greater than his nine million dollars a year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be named after the hospital’s lobby.
Canadiens players have previously made a significant contribution to local hospitals.
One year ago, Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s large hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife's dinner for a Japanese gift, serving simple bikinis and essays on top of her.
The teaspoons are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has goat's coffee, chicken's coffee, vampire's coffee, shrimp's coffee and now a wife's coffee.
It strikes the lonely, the crowds and the hungry.
That's what the Metro news was about.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome (My wife) café, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the client's spouse.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is opposed to just an essay and a bikini on top, the husband again in tight cycling shorts.
The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the candidates for a wife’s pension to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Almost 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against vehicle security began to equip themselves.
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as reported in the Intel release.
The panel consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of the best cyber security practices.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB findings.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60-75 % of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and we must improve the cyber security of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
ASRB allows Intel to consolidate the best safety practices and to support the view that cyber security is a significant component in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as if the moon was rising.
At last, the car is also beginning to look at Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Thanks to Ford's new four-wheeled RS, its 2.3-litre 350-horse engine accelerates from 0 to 100 seconds in 4.7 seconds and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
There is also an interesting price in Finland, which is initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell us in the press.
The favourite brand Kia presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show – such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to take advantage of the ever-increasing street amateur market, is certainly more important than two new ones in Finland.
A new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, was created under the leadership of Sportage, is more circular than before.
The axis range and external measurements have become one inch here and the car cuts the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but has been added to 177 horsepower developed 1.6-litre turbo.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive to us in spring 2016.
Even before the year began to change, the new Kia Optimat will be available in our country.
Looking at the news, it doesn't look like it's changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher level equipment.
Optimums with 1.7-litre turbo-jet and 2.0-litre petrol engines are initially produced.
Next summer, the speed will accelerate when the Optimum GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, comes next to them.
At the same time, it will start selling Optima.
Chisu came back to the stage with a brave grind in the ravine.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life for Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neck opening in an electric dress.
The apartment presents a beautiful singer's belt.
The whole crown of gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three - year break, the mother’s singer has had the weight of pregnancy cut with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter fills a year soon.
The singer published his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back in front of the stage and the general public after a long break.
I've missed everything I've done about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release a new album in a couple of weeks and at the same time his fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if you can find my new record, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law's style will be astounding again.
The real-new beauty of Kim Kardashia gives the subject one after the other.
He presents his pregnant baby and his breast equipment freely in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in the United States, when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian with his husband Kanye West.
Black mammary dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the colored bras under the dress when flashing.
The last time Kardashia was dressed in an amatsonian maternity home, she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The apartment was highlighted by the black superiors.
The third special maternity home is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy baby on display.
Hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted a quick idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about pure model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Although in the previous period you would have put up top designers’ homes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces who will compete for work with the bunkers.
On templates, there's rarely a place they can call a home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses stay their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, your loneliness may be intolerablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York may be asking for pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is bad.
The models want to do this because of the possibilities it offers, but they are flattered by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have some role.
But in the work of a model, you can also express yourself.
The models in Tory Burch's play last night.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks where designers will reveal their design design next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, presents the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
In a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band, Roope Salminen presents the band's founder, Antti Lautala.
The club was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but broke up with the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen's laughing.
I've never wanted to see the real Antti before, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's a good thing that I'm only learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make a human imitation.
The man who's shooting the Roope Salminen and the Dogs band doesn't have a role to play.
The Punk-manes come by their nature.
The stars, the stars, the punks of the program must have seen many foretastes, as has ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a little poop, but we always go full.
In the year 1993-2004, Tuukka Temose directed by Tuukka Temose, the leading actors in the beautiful film was released today.
The crowd of young actors who have become known to the public in the band are still quite unknown to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtata Tatu Sinisalo founded Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his coming pestilence yesterday evening, when he told us in Snapchat that he was secretly preparing his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published a photo of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to perform for the film.

Psychologist: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or should I tell you at all?
There is no need to speak up, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and does not allow them to watch news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in their minds and distress, he says.
However, if the child has run into TV news photos of refugees or heard from elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones parents think he is afraid of.
The child should not be intimidated in vain, even if it bothers and scares himself.
A smaller child closely follows the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter the issue of refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents should talk to them about it if they think about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Together with children, parents can consider how our family is dealing with this.
In our view, however, is the world a safe place or a safe place in the end?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will get a model of how to deal with future problems in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

My powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Difficult to control with a vermo impact
Perttu Nordjola made the Apila Ballosalama shine in mid-summer.
It only ran out of victories and second-tiers until the end of July, when a collapse occurred in Tampere raves.
Since the ori became the root of the problem, the coach suspected something to be wrong and ordered the time of his protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the detonation came to light.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not from the mildest point of view, but the suppression of it required two courses of medicine.
As Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light sports, Pohjola tells us that she was positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time, another SE dam after the Big Wind.
Apilan Pallosalama was very busy when it had been possible to drive normally only a few weeks.
Those things of attention to the small tendency at the end was understandable, Nohjola says.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made orre steel.
I am sure that the horse's hand went forward, and I hope that it would have been even.
Apilan Pallosalama has been known as humor horses.
After not having fun, it could have been thrown fat without disease.
Instead, on a good day, the ores have been released from such a smuggler that the opponents have been in wonder.
At short notice, the racers are unable to cope with the Pallosalama, from which even warm bloody tears can be removed.
The hopes of the north are that there will be a dry run in Vermo.
But the difference is how Apilan Ballosalama agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it's gonna be a lot of fun under the car's boom and that kind of thing.
I hope the Ori would be calmer than it was when Turku left.
Apilan Pallosalama can also come from the bowl when it's in order, and we're going to drive with it for victory, coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of the vain iPhone software
CEO of Apple Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example FaceTime calls, press booth, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a compulsive update on iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart clock owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, because the company does not want to waste the memory of users using iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area declined to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by a fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised the 0.2% forecast slightly downwards from a few weeks ago.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate for the whole of the 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was 1.9 per cent lower than in the previous year.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised index.
Inflation in the euro area is still firmly far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a significant 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, the Central Bank anticipates its release at the beginning of September in its new inflation forecast.
U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its earliest in less than a year's time, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And on the financial markets, the downside begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rates may be starting already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next downturn can be pushed on at its fastest by the next autumn and as a price shift in the financial markets before it.
Or this will at least happen if the world's biggest economy and financial markets function as they have been used to - and if they react to the tightening of Fedi's cash flows as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's strategies for market research in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a comprehensive survey of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international big customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe they know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they present the facts of the economic statistics and their calculations of how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of the previous interest rates - and what they may be following.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more orderly state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
I don't think it's gonna be a year until the beginning of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy and the leaders who decide on its current establishment have all along the way last summer and early autumn suggested that time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate of over nine years can already be paid this week.
The matter will be resolved in the middle of the week and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a relatively regular but at the same time a small range of 0.25 percentage points of interest, with Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended just two years ago.
In 2007, the financial market was affected by the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis broke into a global judgment day nightmare.
The great recession began in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy oppositions began slower than has typically occurred since the former Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were then harder and harder than the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsches' strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the reversals of financial markets since 1950 and places from the early 1800s onwards.
Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact have been clear since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession is at its earliest rate of under one year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The price increase in the financial market has ended within the period of the year to two years from the start of Fedi's interest rates.
In turn, Fed has increased and reduced its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen cycles.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the review is relatively limited, and therefore it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies, therefore, point out that this time there are many things different.
And not just better.
Interests too low too long
The reasons for the financial crisis, if not the guilty, do not necessarily come to light even with decades of research work.
But three aspects of the causes of the crisis and of its devastating effects seem to be somewhat clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world's largest central banks kept their interest rates too low.
They set the traces of the techno-cube and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased even higher than in the past because of the excessive monetary policy impact of the central banks.
It was the biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy.
3) In particular, the almost bulky, packaged, crazy debt financing boosted most of the financial market components until then the biggest price bubbles in economic history from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly the case that the financial markets, which have risen to heights with more complicated bonds, were rarely dangerous and unstable, and when Fed and the other central banks were the last to push interest rates upwards.
The financial structures of the debtors, rather than the valuation bubbles, did not last until after the interest rate had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis, and there was a great recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsches strategis do not guess what will happen next, but they give rise to the subject of fate by, for example, mentioning the following points:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been a crazy thing like ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy is not reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the burden of debt is much heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former and cheaper central banks has largely remained on the financial market and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets most expensive since the peak or at any time before the financial crisis.
Neither are the strategies of the Latin atmosphere only with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession of decades to the model that has taken place before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is abnormally weak, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when the next Fed is tightening up its financial flows.
Perhaps the French bank Societe Generale’s future picture of Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has already trained the bank's international investor clients for the following translations:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial shocks break, and soon it's time for Fedin to rush to shut down the financial blocks with even bigger QE-money shots.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), who manufactures computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed at HP’s Business Services, the company explains.
HP is divided into HP Inc., a PC and printer company focused on business sales in November Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumers.
The number of HP staff was highest in 2011, at which time it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The consumer side's reductions will remain to 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In another year, 65 per cent of the profit was brought by its three largest customers.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System After iPhone Apple Update Release
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download the option and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation when the "Software Update failed" error message appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try updating through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes to remove applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the upgrade, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to progress, as if the battery is running out of time, it may result in the update being broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the government of the tax paradise company
According to Yle, Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax paradise company.
Moreover, the company's activities are linked to so-called tax planning.
It is the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he left the notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a notice of divorce.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in Yle's interview.
Membership after fusion
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs is managed by the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflorin in 2012.
Berner served in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
Moreover, Kährs’ holdings go through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted the membership of the Luxembourg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was applied for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I found that my job was to take care of the capital benefits of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of the capital of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership has nothing to do with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure built on tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the Triton capital fund, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is opening a reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre run by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from tonight from six.
Within a week, the number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former University of Rescue.
Luona Oy maintains its operations, with a particular focus on the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree together on the Centre's security arrangements.
STTK prepares an alternative labour-intensive package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package for the government's labour pressures.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee center organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's expression of spirit.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the meeting of the organization’s administration on a break to the journalists.
Instead, Palola estimates that there is no willingness for discussions in the Central Economic Union (EC).
The STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I do not know whether there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of one side if there is one relationship with one hundred.
Palola: The dialogue was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a relationship between the government and the government, and it has been constructive about him all the time.
According to Palola, the operation of the Sundays is a painful place.
The system requires the government to withdraw from the binding legislation that it would be implementing part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, Palola does not intend to prepare the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work-force package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their minds and have not been the object of the strike.
Acavan Fjäder Thanks
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder, thanked the STTK for the announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming to the same lines with Akava, since Akava has already developed an alternative model for the government's proposals for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK, the package will not be comprehensive enough.
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolan STTK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want security of change and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long prepared its own presentation, ready to negotiate a 5% competitiveness rating for the country's government as an alternative to surgery.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for the government's proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava's lines, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers, Fjäder says.
Ava's Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the fire," "playing bingo when Sipilä talks tonight."
Green Left of Tampere University
The Green Left in the University of Tampere, Viva's bingo coupon for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen canal on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the Prime Minister's previous speech, the Prime Minister must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister holding the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and ministers held several radio talks during the winter and postwar period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a speech instead of a new year's speech to President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike by train drivers on television.
Lone calls, multi-archy meinkins
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and guess what to do all day.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated that "Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the dialogue has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Judges of the SDP condemned the "multi-archist measure: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilä dialogue: "A half a year of elections.
No presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's an attempt.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented on by direct mail from the president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the CEO of the EK, Jyri Hämäman.
It's been a lot of criticism of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote the comprehensive public service of Finland as a whole, as well as the Ylen publication director Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
It's like us at Tammelos.
The speech has also given rise to irritability.
In the evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be hoarded and put on their best clothes.
My mom's gonna put on the brightest third and my dad's gonna settle the tie's neck.
At 9 a.m., they silenced on television like before the ancient Me Tammeloi," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also asks why the Finnish Government is sitting in its tax havens, hiding its capital's millions, which are creating mercy laws for other taxmakers and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut out when the government is out of money?" Pia Lohikoski asks.
One estimate of what Sipilä says is presented by the green left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It's been published on Facebook, along with the bingo.
Can we hear about the same boat tonight, about common coal, about living in debt, about team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Area.
Ahtisaari Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to exclude al-Assad
The Western countries more than three years ago rejected Russia’s offer to give up the power of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, says President Marti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the UN Ambassador to Russia proposed a plan for Al-Assad to leave power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not adhere to the proposal because they thought Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed the three-point plan: the opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and al-Assad were immediately forced to get a speech and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be put into effect with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that you should sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats No Comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he passed on the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr Thurk did not confirm the content of the debate in the paper, but according to the Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said Al-Assad's troops had already committed several mass murders at that time and key opposition groups refused all the agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, views the Ahtisaari speech with hesitation because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point about Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
In that case, according to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's turn to hold power with a supporter of al-Assad.
Refugee flow into our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahtisa Islands, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum-seekers' organisation centre in Tornio
The asylum-seekers organisation centre planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The center would be set up in the city centre in the empty building of Tornio.
The Ministry of the Interior has looked for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsinki Declaration announced that the council had already decided to present the school building as a solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinenen (left), Vice President of Tornio City Council, it is not true.
When the whole council was not in the process of meeting, and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council to decide on it next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
There were 13 members of the system's headquarters who were opposed.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision will be positive, Skipper says.
According to city director Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday and was quickly responded to.
There could be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of meters from the border, so it would also be working in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä ( center) the public halving of holiday money would only take care of part of the government's labour cost reduction.
However, the government would be happy to accept the alternative package if the social partners managed to agree on it.
Mr Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for alternatives to the pressures of the government's announced work life.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will certainly gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
Halving holiday money would be a way of working for Sipilä, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned Sunday surgery.
Labour market organisations could agree on a reduction in the amount of holiday money, since it has been entered in collective agreements instead of in the law.
On this occasion, the government will report to the Parliament next week on the pressures of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the end of the back line either.
Legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become harder and harder all the time.
It's been a long time.
Not long, if there is will, in such matters, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the government includes, among other things, the conversion of the unemployed and men's home to unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of illness will be cut, overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past the unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of this action, the employee centre organisations organise a large-scale protest on Friday, and several trade unions have also issued political decrees.
Tohmajärvi Council approved an expansion of the mahogany warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the mahalli warehouse.
The criticism caused the project to be bigger and more expensive than had originally been said.
Also a busy schedule excitedly.
Even that little wonderd that the need for space was not known one year ago when it was decided on the previous enlargement.
At this stage, an expansion of 400-450 square metres to the investment programme was adopted, but the money will be decided upon in the context of the interim report.
The next item was the EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000 investment, but the Technical Director, Mr Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (p.).
In Joensuu, the place for the language of Karelia
The city government eased its position to bring the street signs of cattle to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right sense, the election of the cattle tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself to be the capital of the language of cattle, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of cattle is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more a part of Eastern Savoles.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs in the centre of the city.
However, the city of Joensuu is prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use the language of cattle, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the language of the cattle now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still unique in the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of them can be of great use in the multi-pronged marketing of the province.
The closure of rail connections reduces the vitality of the province
The operation of train connections will impact the province's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region's economic life and competitiveness.
And it does affect whether you can live and work here at all, because the city director of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been included on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole region that we cannot afford to be reduced by government measures, as is currently happening.
The impact of these closures on employment, for example, should be looked at.
The decline in traffic links is a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services available here, such as transport connections and housing, is the easier to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He pointed out that poor traffic links also had an impact on the research community, which was very mobile and travelled a lot for research purposes.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that the marketing of the university towards Western Finland is difficult already at the moment, because traffic connections are in a cross-sectional direction.
Currently, about half of students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10 to 20% are from the New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of my warriors for the war of Siun
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the provincial Siun war project seems to be unanimous, but there is even one of my sorcerers.
At a Monday meeting, the city government member Pentti Kessalo (ed., pictured) presented the whole project to the government, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of the Mayor of Kari Kareliainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotva to Kouvola ends next year
The passenger train traffic from Kott to Kouvola will remain even in the future, even though there are fewer train drivers.
There will be changes in the passenger train segment between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains will be gone, but still five days later they will reach Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government savings measures.
For the next four-year period, the purchase of train traffic by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will set new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one of them couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The rescue agency released a 12-year-old who could not get off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at Tornioinen on the Ketotie side of the road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent a bunch of boys who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mast of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others were busy and the passers-by alarmed the rescue facility to help the betkeepers safely return to the surface of the land.
FedEx's operating profit doubles, lowers its 2016 tax year outlook
FedEx reports depressive results in the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut its full year-round performance forecast, causing the decline in freight services demand and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it was going to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent to the opening auction 45 minutes before the middle week opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the end of the tax year next May to result in $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84, we'll tell you in factset's question.
In spite of an average price increase of 4.9 %, which came into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November for heavy or large parcels.
The company said that it expects business profits to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is "stable taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for wages during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that it intends to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, approximately the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31st, FedEx’s result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which remains at an average of $2.44. The 12 analyst survey carried out Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been suffering from a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its Express unit sales.
However, the rise in online commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the country unit rose by 29 per cent, but revenue from operations was in principle the same because of the cost of larger packages and own insurance.
Express's revenues were higher due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening time, FedEx’s shares decreased to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed by 11 per cent in the fall for this year and 17 per cent less than the 11-day record for June.
The decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank will be sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting, deciding whether or not time has come to raise the interest rate for the first time to almost a decade.
The second one is a wall painting from the United States, decorated with a double-storey meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must put the nation's financial interests ahead of anything else.
Congress has put double responsibility on the central bank: they must maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
However, after the great recession, the Central Bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement can be a decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday , which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted . The decision whether the US economy is ready to rescind the pre-negotiation incentive , which has brought the short-term interest rate at almost zero since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data show a steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in the global financial market may have made the central bank officials, already alerted in advance, even more fearful in terms of increasing instability.
"Comprehensively, labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the leading financial expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for the right to remain at the level of interest, the increased uncertainty on the world market is still waiting for a valid basis," he says.
There has been no agreement on the Central Bank’s decision, which already gives rise to nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloomberg’s recent research, about half of the financial experts predict an increase in interest rates this week.
The financial market expects the central bank to delay the upswing, as the key indicator indicates that growth is only around 30%.
This refers to the fall in securities markets if the central bank raises the level, if then the decision-makers are not able to soften the impact by promising that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, by 16 599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will maintain its level this week," says John Lonski, the main financial expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If decision-makers raise interest rates, "you have to see a lot of effort in your policy to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that the rising level would calm the financial market, as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank is operating.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards tightening up the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
In the spring and early summer it has been said that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for further economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent, which is at least seven years old and close to the level which the Central Bank considers to be the threshold for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of stimulation.
Although inflation remains below the central bank's 2 % annual target, the central bank's decision-makers indicate that this will have a temporary impact on the price of oil that has fallen significantly.
Economic "clears even higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial market around the world was shattered last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell by up to 16 per cent from its May forecast, when investors feared that the Chinese slow-down economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month and Dow is now almost 10% below the peak reading in May.
For central bank decision-makers, the market storm is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells because interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and news of recent weeks' weakness in China's economy, decision-makers would intensify the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still rather unclear, and they do not have much information available on the consequences of the events in China," Oliner says.
The welfare of the international economy is not central to the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the President of the Bank’s then president, suggested that the central bank could “reduce” the amount of money, caused revolutions on the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, Head of Envestnet Inc's Global Strategy for Property Management.
This month, Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker, in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted to its financial market business, which has appeared to be separate from the economic rationale."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which is taking decisions, has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacer, a member of the Committee who is entitled to vote, draws an example to the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings, "in spite of its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," Lacker says.
One year later, the Central Bank overturned these cuts.
The Central Bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Committee on Determining Interests.
The latest storm does not get near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to see a situation where interest rate increases are feared because markets are getting worse," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a twofold requirement, and it does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Children’s Health Organization in Rio Grande promotes healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Society for Childhood Disease (SPRS) has invented a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breast feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the necessary nutrients to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only diet change that mothers should do.
The recent research conducted by Professor Robert Waterland at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven-channel Sunrise program is popular in viewers, despite the Nine-channel companies news of the leader demonstration Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic's and Lisa Wilkinson's rush into Canberra's news of the liberal party's subsequent revelation failed to add to Toda's audience.
The Nine Canal morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull defied the power of Tony Abbott.
The challenging program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to be impeding Australian TV viewers, because the average viewing value of Sunrise was 397,000 in five state capitals, while the number of Today was 339 thousand.
The average was slightly higher than on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today, we've been catching Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318,000 and for Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers, while today it is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event in the morning.
The changes in the winds are blowing away from Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news of the Seven-channel was the 800-word series, featuring the star of the former Packed to the Rafters series, Erik Thomson, an amazing introduction.
The new drama series, which collected an impressive 1.219 million viewers’ average, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series would be a powerful force alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
The Seven-channel The X Factor program was a strong favourite for 1,136 million viewers, easily winning both The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The seven-channel had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefen’s new screening program collected an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers, which was enough to win a small win from Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (63,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half - hour viewing average was 520,000 viewers, while the second half - hour reading was 720,000.
The average for Hot Seal was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second-night viewer count down will give the Nine Canal confidence that the Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire's audience.

The final three agree with Dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeawart-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
The woman's identity has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor's.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeont-Fellows the day before two of the three came, they could unwittingly give a clue about the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women became poetic in telling how Wood is a perfect man mentioned his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood is not the last rose for you, to whom should it go?", their answers could offer a revelation of who won the boy's heart.
Both Jewon-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay's best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been inflexible since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies (Sarahin) and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind for a whole series of years," said Jewain-Fellows.
"Sarah is really close to the ground, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said last week's home-visiting meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now with all my heart in it," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the other girls as much, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne's bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league dropped the ball in its first flight kick back to the team when it won the 20-3 read in Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Haynen a return flight and took him into a running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's real character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of blaming his new arrival as a baton before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist editor Cam Inman reports that Haynea also encouraged Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight kick Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted for a man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen screaming on the way from the field after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio pairing division Hamish & Andy at a frequency of 104.1 to 2DayFM, that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was now just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his acidification to his Origin debut in 2007 when his input in his own goal area led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed to her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding Australia's flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested on a gun in threatened Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died of police shooting at rubber bullets against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old son, died in southern Nepal, shot by police in a crowd who expressed their opinion against the country’s new draft Constitution, the authorities reported on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the highest official in the area, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station and some of them threw rocks and fire extinguishers.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets that were known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks, in violent demonstrations across Nepal, the agreement was the southern balance, with members of the ethnic group named Madhesi saying that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
After August 10, violent clashes have killed at least 40 people, 11 of whom were police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmanda, and the authorities have said that a new charter can be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Centre NHC says that the south side of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a whirlwind.
On the broad front of the lowland, about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Island, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical vortex over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
On the other side of the narrow, low pressure, which is in the middle of the Cape Verde archipelago and the Small Antilles, there is also a 60% chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind over the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google starts a donation campaign with the goal of collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe to escape from war breaks and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective in its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making a report to the director, Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who was seven years old with his family from Kabul, wrote about his personal experience.
"Our countries included numerous dark train and bus tracks, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations will receive four non-profit organisations to help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it equals every donation made on the Google.com/refugerelief website worldwide up to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to a civil war that lasted for four years in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Reduction surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of a dietary surgery of type 2 obese type 2 may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after a reduction operation than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to obtain death information," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. "He is a paralysing expert who wrote the editorial in the new JAMA Surgery magazine.
Different methods for reducing the size of the abdominal bag are used in dietary or bariatric surgery.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been sick with fat and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of the weight to the length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person is more than 30, he or she is considered to be excessive.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, bypass surgery, and a reduction in the stomach, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI for cut-off subjects fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained largely the same in 29 persons who were treated by means other than surgery.
Of the cut-off persons, 36% had a total improvement in diabetes and 28% had a partial improvement.
Due to comparison, in the medicated group, diabetes improved by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-colestor "were generally better in the surgery group", the authors stated.
Researchers also monitored patients’ blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should be maintained at less than 7% by researchers.
post-operative haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, it remained stable at around 8% in the treatment group.
This better "glycemic control", described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over the past five years, says the lead researcher, Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu, with his colleague.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, when compared to a group undergoing gastric reduction surgery, a group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased weight index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1 %), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7 %).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
The Swedish study found that obesity was 29 per cent lower than the probability of dying during the 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not appear to improve the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are, however, encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the research are crucial precisely in that they show that the surgery is safe for the group of the lower weight index", and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time of the patient’s BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long to take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, withdrawal is very difficult.
"Not everything can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in the countries of refugees.
Ms Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of her 10-day British visit to the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a centre dedicated to ethics research.
In the present situation, the Dalai Lama claimed that the needs of all mankind should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
"Not everything can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their action in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to consider how we can reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
When addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US violent response caused the chain's violent events.
"After the 9th of November, I wrote to President Bush and told him that there was a solution to this problem through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Over the last four years, the ingestion of a child’s hand-disinfectant has increased fourfold.
Toxicity data centres across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400% in the swallowing of a hand-infectant containing alcohol after 2010 for children under 12 years of age, says Georgia Toxicity Data Centre.
The Director of the IC, Gaylord Lopez, according to the Director of the Georgia Toxicity Information Centre, reported cases of disinfectant in children under 12 years of age were increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will have to go on duty," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in the social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teens drink disinfectants to get a low-cost riser.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to make a stronger drink.
The scents of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those with added scent.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange-like disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand disinfectant may contain alcohol anywhere between 45 % and 95 %.
In particular, only a few injections of alcohol poisoning is required in small children.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," said Mr. Stephen Thornton, Director of Health Care at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a viscous shot on the table, but a hand-disinfectant is left out, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago swallowed only four injections of strawberries scented with hand disinfectant in school, and she was taken to first aid for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drinking limit, says Chris Ritchey, an emergency clinic doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When Nhaiah was speaking, he could not walk when he arrived in the first aid.
The doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
It could have been a killing situation for my kid.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers should use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three four - graders planned to poison their "wrong" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and denied its class.
The police must prevent the plan from being "imposed" and leave discipline to the school district.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths disagrees with Celtic's contradictions, and Delia admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he makes it turn around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is alert to January's recruitments, which may interfere with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic's five points.
Adam Rooney’s first half-time penalty shot Aberdeen’s narrow victory at Hamilton’s Pittodri Stadium and enabled the team to increase the gap to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths is deploring speeches of contradictions
There have been rumours about Celtic’s internal contradictions, but Griffiths passed them right away. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more precise observation when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch series leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are expecting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship to bore the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the Championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're interested in that.
These teams have a lot of excitement, and non-Scottish people also want to follow them.
Deila swears to turn around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss is sworn to turn around.
Losing to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions’ League quickly followed a loss of ten men playing Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series at five points apart from the next.
But Delia said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're gonna get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to go on.
Indeed, we need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton alerts against January player transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible points of January player transfer, he is alert to the most recruitment-oriented assuring that he does not want to confuse the team’s unanimity.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the time to adjust is the entire time that is ahead of us, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu's hint of retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name has been attached to the transfer window in connection with Celtic, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans is terminated.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankle problems, and he did not succeed in finding a new match outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defenseman’s red card was later cancelled, and this was already in the last eight months a third collection of red cards condemned, which was cancelled.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastlea
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded after he sang an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at the Edinburg Roseburn pub, before the Edinburg derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"There was a derby and it was a moment of annoyance," the attacker added, "It's safe to say I won't go back to Tynecastle unless I move to Celtici."
The Tannadic government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys right again," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy "bad victory" in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve a seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them five points above Celtic, thanks to Adam Rooney’s first half-time penalty kick.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, be it a trophy or a league that would not have won games in this way."
The unemployment rate of the Scottish population remains the same as the United Kingdom's overall growth rate.
Employment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the United Kingdom increased by a total of 1.82 million in total.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than in Great Britain, which is 5.5%, as reported by the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of the administration is to build a base for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over the course of these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to the execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I will see when the man is executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm sitting at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in the viewers' magazine watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses who died.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to get horrified this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media to twelve and five.
Whoever's chosen, look at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I come to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own contact calls during months, as well as a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and pen to record what I see.
All I have to do is try and remember all the details.
On Twitter, a Danish journalist accused me of being neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell me the prisoner's story in the way he wants you to, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose the reporter.
He admits that "it could have set its words better", but still believes that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I'm supposed to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said so.
I've told him that he can at any time remove me from the list of witnesses.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware's right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the series of podcast broadcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treee would in any case make him responsible for helping.
But I believe that there is a very strong chance that he will not be guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the point I'm looking at him dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists on site who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I love die unnecessarily.
A man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he attracted the man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his position went wrong when he found himself in the shallow, muddy water only a few feet away from the police officer who tried to "find him gently back to the beach".
Canning Vale's police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday because of an unwarranted intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this tried to distract them by pointing to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not coming out, I'm coming for him," said the older colonel, "Stradell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavez did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said older Sergeant Castledine.
Masterballist Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid noise and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start the playful Ben Cousins biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims that the journalists tried to spy on him and threaten to end the competition
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria’s suppliers tried to infiltrate their stables in his stables last year and threaten to end the competition immediately.
He accuses journalists and Racing Victoria's corruption division, claiming that they have a personal campaign in progress against him. Wednesday, Lady Tatain's late rejection of the race day was the last witch.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He's been holding his tongue for about a year and a half on spy charges, and he didn't want it to look like a envy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that it all goes down at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to go on training anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm doing on my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview on racing.com where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man, and I called him when I asked him, and offered him work in my locker if he gave me information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, it is true that they should separate their lawyers, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps transfer responsibility to non-trainers for what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying might make them think that's what I'm saying.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has increased with long-term Lidar’s cobalt research, and the late rejection made him say that he could “drop his license over the table”.
Moody, who is best known for the training of the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule "pure" after the mud or clay hair has been placed on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees wrongly put mud on it.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was yesterday.
It was on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to cataract treatment, which was initiated by the suppliers.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested driver in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of traffic flight after having hit a cyclist at Cobram in the weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having suffered serious injuries as a car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of nonstopting in the accident, neglect of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is attacking the competitors in the fight.
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm has criticised the champions of two NRL-rugby leagues for being part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm's "print" on their own side when it unexpectedly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the Final Card. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "screen window" and said that two Queensland teams were not "hardly excited" buttons.
Bellamy defended his team's punches and said they were just focusing on "contacts" in the tacla.
Bellamy added that his trust added to the two leading coach’s criticism of Storm, as it means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the pressure when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or in our techniques throughout the year. Over the last six weeks, we've just been focusing on contacts in stockings, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he probably is not used to losing, and so this was a small shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a "tiring rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's training of St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "excellently".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said that there was no less to care about.
But now he has a team that can play rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its kind of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I'm getting more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think we were against important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more pointed than the game played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it a violation of an exciting line of defense and a failure to make a goal?
This is about the guidelines for me.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game, either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronut Sharks against next Saturday night's prefinal in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Security for Serbia for $200,000 in drug charges
A man threatened by a possible life span of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released against a guarantee sum of $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay hunt that came to South America through Vanuatu and landed in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was seen seeing others accused of boating all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens a possible life-long cocaine holding company, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has solid connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had together offered $200,000 in security to ensure his release.
"After reading the certificates of election of both persons, it is clear that setting a sum of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrenders both his passports to Australia and Serbia, reports daily to the police, and holds his no-outside between the night and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used a girl's phone at the age of 11 to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to sleep on this phone and then logged in to the online communications service where Hogg received numerous unsuspected pictures of the children that another user sent to her.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked at her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five photos, searched the computers there, and found "careful" online searches using search terms used to search for childless images.
Hogg then told the cops that he had done this "to pick up the pedophiles" on the Internet before he "presented himself to the police to scare them".
Mr. Eilidh Robertson told the Dundeen Sheriff Court Court the following: "He said that it is an addiction - that he is dependent on fearing people.
He admitted that he had completed the grave on a computer but said that they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, and about when Hogg asked the person to send more photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, it's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying.
My mom saw the unconscious pictures on the phone and then she met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked like her younger.
Hogg, a 23-year-old living on Ward Road in Dundee, confessed his guilt on the 25th of January of this year and failed to enter court on 24th of March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not be entered in the sexual criminal record, since it can be argued that his crime did not include "a significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmiceal postponed the sentence to October, in order for the social action to have time to prepare the background reports.
Mr Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other cases he is under arrest prior to processing.
He was added to a record of sex offenders before the day of the conviction.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe made the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the talker boom.
He didn't get hurt, but a video about falling spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament’s opening members also tarnished the arguments of the opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous killing orders warning them not to confiscate Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bludgeoned and interrupted him with intermediate calls when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group supervisor of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Party, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages from their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is called 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The communication warned the members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The group supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printing business from its growing business equipment and services.
The expected job cuts will cost around $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said the HP press release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable transport structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, which will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it "continues to produce unmatched integrated technology solutions" for companies, reported in the Company's press release.
In the 1930s, the company was set up by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University to produce electrical equipment. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakso's birth".
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to deal with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology firms in the United States, and its division is the latest sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb balance game
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that he will be able to recover according to the plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss out on at least four of the next games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in the European Championship next summer.
The greatest pity in this last problem is that Wilshere's last season was strong after an individual ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't get well.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with her ankles or any previous injuries that she's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, the player’s attempt to return between them always involves the risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model for shaping.
The studies carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshe has had 23 different injuries since her debut six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years he has played 157 league games in Arsenal only 65 games.
In view of Arsenal’s larger size after the 2007-08 season, six out of eight have been the second of the Valioliga teams that have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits to the possibility of witchcraft, but Arsenal believes that their last season’s improvement in disability statistics will continue.
"Sometime you get back from the injury can be an exposed period, when you have to strengthen your body and win competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that her body will stabilize, I am sure that will happen, and that she will be able to make such a career as deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts the Champions' League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, after Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give breath to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F-block, the Maximian Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Also, Dinamo has not lost 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night, which was at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the surrender of the League of Masters against Monaco last season, and he is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I know how to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not deserters.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is eye-catching to see how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death among men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The aim was to challenge a culture that prevented men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included over 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the person’s chances of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were “in a good mood”.
Similarly, if they had healthy friends, the probability of the occurrence of possible mental health problems was halved.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media, the style of communication passes through content and the instantness of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though, in reality, isolation prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this takes place at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of inner desire - that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The Fréndie's fineness was precisely that it turned over to the head of this focus.
One character did not define their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments of comfortable chairs watching football, Ross miss Rachel - these humor came out of knowing that yes, men can identify with all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer worker of the Samaritans organization explained to me: "In listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understand how the least interaction with a friend can improve the situation."
Often the men who contact us feel that you can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "overly getting" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frends are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of my phone helps people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you take part in Comedy Central's FriendsFestium this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned for the celebration, why not take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or, what's even better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest'
Di Maria makes a goal and helps PSG to hit the Malmö side
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan are celebrating goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in the Master League’s debut to help PSG bypass the Swedish team on Tuesday in Malmö.
Below the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started their championship game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions League debyying a goal less than four minutes to the French league road, but the team lost several opportunities before finally adding their lead in Cavan’s strike at goal 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same A-block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because the game was not only a continuation but also a improvement in their quarter-finals-led games in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn’t a classic game, because the Laurent Blanc’s team in Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and that team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or in guests, so the 2-0 win will bring problems to the opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even if there are things we're going to have to grind this season," Blanc said.
This is for the good.
We wanted to win and win, even though unfortunately we couldn't make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after three changes after the team remained in the 2-2 game Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he remained in the shadow of Di Maria in 4 minutes.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinean launcher was named a man who will take the PSG to the new level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran into Marco Verratt's feed behind the Malmö defense line and then hit the back of the beautiful finished Johan Wiland.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a staunch opponent. It won Celtic’s match when reaching this level, with nine international players and five men’s defenses and two players in a deep middle field.
But on the side of the attack, the team offered little more than a 34th minute shot of Nikola Djurdjic, which passed by the nip of Kevin Trappi.
On the other hand, because of lost inputs and poor finishings, the PSG had to fail at times, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball into contact with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-work for his colleagues, and it was just from Ibrahimovic’s feed that Di Maria sent a tour of the spot that tilted around the Wiland finish line for 52 minutes.
Finally, after an hour’s play, the second goal was scored in the sixth goal of the season, with the help of Cavan, a Uruguayan, after Ibrahimovic had passed from the left of Maxwell’s cross - eat.
It ended with Malmö’s hopes to get back to the game, and only Wiland’s great fight for David Luis’s direct kick kept the final numbers down before the end of the game was rejected Ezequiel Lavezz’s goal.
Malmo's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "The last time we played our Champions' League was in December of last year."
After that, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
I don't think we're gonna get enough of the cuttings.
I'm gonna raise my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in shares for sale
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the collapse in commodity prices, to collect $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares for about GBP 1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the Chinese economy slows down demand and destroys all markets.
The new mark raised Glencore’s value in the early mid-week of the London Stock Exchange.
Shares rose by 2.77% in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion last week as part of its broader plan to cut its debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital with 125 penny shares, which meant a 2.4% reduction on Tuesday at the closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing rise in China have cut iron ore prices to about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China’s President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the statement published on Tuesday by the White House confirmed.
X's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the opinion said.
The US President and the President's spouse Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for X and this spouse for Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held the bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of Mr X gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X an opportunity to discuss constructively the issues of disagreement," the draft added.
On a first-time visit to Seattle in February, Xin is also expected to deviate on his trip to Washington, D.C., to meet a number of US technology leaders before continuing to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns regarding China's alleged cyber-opportunity and the increased absoluteness of the country in the waters under dispute in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is deploring the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon joined up with Effie Brown, an Afro-American filmmaker, in discussing the difference that Damon says is not needed behind scenes.
The actor in HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight interrupted Brown's focus on the need for different perspectives for the dark main character of the manuscript selected for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it is taken into account when selecting actors for the film, not the series," Damon said.
"Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were stuck in the air.
The other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to urge people to think about any director then, how they treat Harmony's personality," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore that his white better beats.
The Dear White People’s producer demanded the rights of film guidance to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied harshly that their guidance “may end up giving us something we don’t want”.
When the conversation was broadcast, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr.Pooni expressed his anger at the film game by writing: "Matt Damon talking about the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is AWARE that happens."
After its publication, Twittau collected over 5000 re-twitting and 4000 likes.
Damon's comments are at a time when a precise racial presentation in the media is in the interest of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread throughout the country and called on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the issue when presenting the year's album nominations for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to answer Fox News' television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether a group should be considered as an hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon was involved in the group of entertainers, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear if he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American ninja warrior champion crowned
Professionalist and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received a $1 million main prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition programme, which was decided on for the seventh time, who would have overcome the obstacles to the programme in all its shares.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb the 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge at his time, which made him the first athlete of all time who explained American Ninja Warrior’s rejuvenating 4th. However, Caldiero resolved the challenge more quickly than three seconds, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a hard-to-achieve victory and was still in shock for winning the $1 million main prize.
"I mean, this is great thinking when I've never made or lived as much as $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So I suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be... the future is unknown.
The producer director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter the fiinalist as well as why Britten does not get more reward money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass through, the money will get the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a change in life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's gonna feel upset about that.
He's just so happy that he's had to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period, the descriptions of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past Minnesota Twins
Well, the other half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played their part perfectly on Tuesday when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get into the game-side head from Houston Astros in the competition for another American League wild card spot.
For at least one night, Detroit had a return to the six-letter H-word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early assault aid when Detroit ran three times in the first two laps, and then once again in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) entered 6 1/3 in the lap and released three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It is difficult for the switch to enter every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' seats Victor Martinez hit three times and enabled two runs that were his first run after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three beats night after he hit four Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in practice), looked considerably better in practice and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the seventh pair in the second half, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Senator Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting the left line twice.
On the right side Aaron Hicks settled at the sight of one nest, and Simon got burned directly by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked the Wall, the only player opposed, ahead of the beginner, Miguel Saya, who threw two nests running to the left of the right hand of Drew VerHagen.
While two runners were in the field and a levelling runner at the second base, VerHagen got a third base of Trevor Plouffe to hit the double-playing finish night.
It was the record of the main series: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received the assurance run at the ninth start, the Wall hit two beaten runs against Tigers lockner Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned me in three feeds in his fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust at first.
Tigers got three runs in the first two laps against a right-handed veteran player who got out of the injured list before playing after being out for more than a month due to a downside infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want such a start," Hughes said, "but when I was in the game I was more comfortable, and I felt like I had made some nice feeds on the third round."
After Hughes picked up the first nest, he let another nest player, Ian Kinsler, go one way.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in the situation of two fires led to a hit by Victor Martinez, who took himself to the first base at midfield and caused the game to run for the first time.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipeline while running in good running positions.
The third player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and caused another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to move on to the third.
Tigers continued on the other side and got one fire, two nest conditions running from the trapper James McCann and two burns, one nest situation running from the centri Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit me very well, but it flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed readings and entered an unrunning third turner, after which he was replaced by a right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six strokes and a walk on four fires.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was removed from the throw-in shoulder due to a stretch.
He studied Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August because of the shoulder trauma, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed feeder Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norriksen’s statistics at Tigers are 1-1 at the four beginnings after the left-handed feeder David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been outside since August 20th due to the proper vinification of the abdominal muscle.
The series of the Tigers and Twins three games ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) from the right hand feeder of Minnesota.
Xi calls for a wider world to open up the economy
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the Group on Tuesday, which is to guide the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said when he spoke at the 16th meeting of the Group leading up to the reform process.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being driven forward with more movement and more vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth," Xi said.
The management group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative market access list, a laxity of border control principles, a call for State-owned companies to take on private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list is created which identifies those sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives a greater role to the market in targeting resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the opinion states.
The government also eases its control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies themselves decide how to carry out their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up the sectors governed by the state, more areas will be opened up to private financiers.
"The Board does not change its policy with regard to foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed by foreign nationals and provide better services to them", the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for permanent resident permits, the "green card", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and the support of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in the post-meeting opinion.
