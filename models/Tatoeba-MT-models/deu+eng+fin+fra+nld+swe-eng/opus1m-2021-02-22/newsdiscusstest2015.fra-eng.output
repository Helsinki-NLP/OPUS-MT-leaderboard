UKIP survivors who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the side effects.
First you use spevel arguments, then discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to take the tail behind intolerants to the chronic hypocondria that think they're all due.
I think you're the one who's using a very good argument.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing cingles, does not exist virtually.
I believe that is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torchoon is not evidence.
Yes, so shoot on the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented.
Those controlling the majority of the media in that country should be fired for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you're aware of what a sizable argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity either, so you should pay attention when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase has been very surprising, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to be able to get back to it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his crazy disciples of Thatcher who think AIDS and the floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have anything arranged.
Hope almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''TIGRE OF EUROPE'' was praised, a few years ago.
We've met the next one!
This recommmence has read the article.
There is an attempt to suggest that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, the lowest societies in Europe are impotence, a smooth working process, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not what ''paveise'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, Irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese In considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead of us.
Their development was not a long quiet river, it is on the view of recent events.
Rate of the lowest impotence in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on impotence actually paid by multinationals.
According to a 2008 or 2009 report, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full money.
Now I confirm that road traffic has come again huge, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the beginning.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon turn on.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once it's set.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Is it possible for Ryanair to pay passengers an additional fee for the additional fear that it was willing to provide them?
But without such Irish companies, you could not allow yourself to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves to joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate only have to take it for themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs arising from this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Burgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally world-class.
People don't come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, mostly) or for the magazine's salon at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyperintellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the stores are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think the Sunday opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, full of world with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in zero tax.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of business figures each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, reduces prices.
Dominical rest is a right enjoyed by employees, except for exceptions.
That is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they wrap her up.
What's the law for?
Satisfied part of the population and companies wishing to work Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against Fascism
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against Fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's inheritance was, against her will, used to pay her inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Probably his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and its well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He held the head of other government Aristotles who wanted to discuss an "aristotle" with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill on the bar for those five years, just five years, and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That its descendants sell the paintings on the free market to bring together the money of succession costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they bring the money together to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage to his country during the Second World War.
A revitalization of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring as infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real frank evil: distrust of dialogue
Back to princely values.
Unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
That the weakest of us are not in need!
Either we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has the right in exchange for services that he provides or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who has income from his property.
It is necessary to distinguish between those who invest for a return at the time of their retirement and those who live from their pensions.
A property to rent, or two for a couple above, is vice versa.
The small genius of Finance is uniquely lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of decline emerges in response to a recession which is only a brutal wild decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is raging: insulation, railway network renovation, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A tax that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same lineup
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's benefit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don't attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and price priment.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and must be encouraged.
This is of interest to all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our pruning friends who according to one of them fight the ideas and not the men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us what author they fight the ideas on the genre and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or do they just attack like described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmur?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato referring to Holopherne, rapprochement that didn't come to me (I don't have his spirit life).
Otherwise, in the "fund", since you're referring to it, I'm not interested in this subject, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backlog, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@Jean: recognize that, culturally, to return Judith to Holopherne, that is true.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ provide us with answers.
The first by calling on the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic sling of throat.
We can see how intimate these studies are.
Obviously, we are no longer in the debate on the idea.
That's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read ,Jean , that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: Regarding an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I don't think it's very rigorous to try to fight ideas from the only exposure they do to them (cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian).
But, as I explained to our mümtrontist friend, the whole difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion is.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic sling of throat, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more than my time) that I believe the source of "the source" according to the wishes of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon appeared briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really host the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special Flash Blood Moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey is responsible for the Laboratory.
But if Labour accepts our budget unfairly, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover up throughout the week the rain of Perseid meteors and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he disappears?
It seems that you are spending a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to come into collision with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
None of the inequalities between labour income and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The ultimate liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so we can make an opinion.
Go to see today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been down for five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapses.
Yet he seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around EUR 8 billion.
The Department of the Economy tells us that these claims are not based.
What if the Department of the Economy made a mistake?
Will policy makers who have gained political benefit from the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
Follow-up in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No the state is not comparable to the households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it will help finance tangible and intangible investments in the growth of the future and therefore in future revenue.
A few elements of the answer.
An unfortunate decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your imagination.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by law as written by politics.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the idolatrous masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
doctors don't make money with drugs Seeing that the Liberals want our health system to look like the US, you should learn how it works.
All over the world, doctors are courted the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It was perhaps wrong to put the blame on the soubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and "research".
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences between countries on what is available for free sale or only on prescription.
This reinforces itself is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, in spite of the laws that hinder them and the necessary expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those that reach a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip on the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
We can't record patents on grass...
If "researchers" in the social sciences did research instead of policy and networking, their "work" could be used.
A detective's investigation, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
I don't want to compare it.
Compare it is to do pedagogy not research.
One cannot say "the search is finished one has to apply it" and then in a single jet "you have to experience everything goes".
If your research is completed why experiment?
If your research is not completed why do you ask for it to be applied?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can say that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn how to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are only one indicator which makes it possible for us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is it to build an indicator that informs you of what is going on, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologists from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabricate link the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservativeism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow us to advance the system".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners , even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no room.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Give more weight to the theorists of education, it would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally fucked up: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like to be operated by a surgeon who doesn't have a theoretical training and who has learned a lot.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member of Parliament responsible for combating copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmare thanks.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will simply read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright violation = Vol.
This is the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often getting a licence costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not at all.
By using content without an adequate license, you deprive artists of their toaster.
You can always discuss pedestrian assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously, it does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for pictures used in school duties, a nearly perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favourite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property on the site under the general terms and conditions they have passed from a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export that resource that we're recovering from, the gutter that says everything's going wrong...
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in a private company ever since.
I had CHANCE to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know that I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to pull red balls on the zero bosses I frequently meet.
At ease in my basketball I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if compared to German companies that French business leaders quote constantly to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies were able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small ones - What do French employers expect to do the same??
That the state holds their hands?
That state they're accused of impertinence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couple from you!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of the French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and denouncing while waiting for the permanent assistantate of the state!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' expenses, taxes, work 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to claim a fall in wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given how people always complain about First Group.
Based on what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves flowing rather than to transform themselves.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
Well, Labour's gonna kill us, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all that so that the decision is finally overturned.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, has won the eight-year Crossrail contract.
Well, Labour, as they repeated during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all be helped across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
It may be because Dutch management is on good rails when British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change in ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchiser.
"It was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but really I hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "batten" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "batten" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "batteners", who are no less dead, I know of palpated ones.
Coming out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's go back to work, too.
I'm not telling you that's the condition to get rid of it, I'm telling you that it's AIDE.
Nothing has to do with any merit...!
When, in the example of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can detract from not getting out of it, is simply horrible.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think the opposite, if having a solid morale is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it, to try experimental treatment as this woman did and not refuse it for fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine..
But if we'd rather get back to the Lord, that's another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're gonna get yourself to be just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirty people, big people, and if I "batched" myself like those psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to tighten your teeth, to suffer hell and to cash the blows.
I thought the prosecution against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then beaten under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
Has the communist become a nationalist who has triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask, then, what has been voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MONDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The Westerns used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State, which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence, and was effectively recognized by the Western States, who then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic tyranny (even if we do not like it).
To my knowledge there is only a method of predicting earthquakes in Greece about, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thanks for sharing the results.
Hope, therefore, but caution is of the essence This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAA-P-11b, located about 124 years light from Earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So the method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals that feel a threat.
Thank you Science Passer to please us, often, of these experimental prowess that are carried out in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has a priori inodorous for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has at his disposal.
But we don't have any reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the battle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before an earthquake.
So I'm not a scientist but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and nobody despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake, the red fish turned strangely around.
I don't understand why we think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as a mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program, you can't stop thinking that this man doesn't know anything about it and he's always trying to make a diversion with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't hold one.
It only highlights to what extent the rest of the Conservative Party is just a mess, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been trained to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popular score of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what we said about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "ferrous Strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually went to Savo's island in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission touches its end.
It's just the kids.
But the eco-side is a total smoke.
Calculate the consumption of kerozen to achieve the deterdibilizing goal completely the concept..
Just go through the list of Sponsors Que des philanthropes.
And a com operation that didn't do or did.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recit makes me come back again, identifying myself a bit at the crossing (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the relocation.
The end justifies the means.
Keep coming back, and show us with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think the red hat that showed against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote one of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training that are of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team.
He's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of land or before in the 70s and 80s and led numerous teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the patronage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful teammate of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know that he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not in possession of it.
Maybe he's still doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighboring.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was no too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country to the neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are in the interior without any pain?
How??
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only thing that could have, if only once, spontaneously rejoiced at the horrific death of thousands of people, in my view evidenced a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest care.
No doubt at the moment of "joie" we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It has just been thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had managed to do real and apocalyptic harm to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
Make qqch powerful.
The grandiose.
It would seem that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are robbed of their sense of humiliation.
With testimony filmed in Palestine.
It's a classic pleasure to be in love.
We doubted it a little.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaulian" cannot measure the degree of frenzy, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim Arab world today.
I'm talking about Cairo's falcons or Algiers, not Dubai's towers.
The splendor of the past, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How does the Muslim world get out of this diabolical amazement?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: Conservativeism fascinates power in place and nihilism fascinate.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood it before, must not delay Muslims.
It's the only way.
Has Edwy Plenary read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long, dark, humid and depressed months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for the mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to blow off the breath in autumn.
Not as much breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grindows that scratches!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall ill in winter.
But now I am retired and I no longer develop immunity to outside germs, that can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrinity that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of sneezing and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances , it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households having seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , the most important factors ( median income ) are the 4 and 5 deciles in question , as shown in Chart 2 .
The removal of the half-part concerning especially widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under-assessed: 230M of Euro is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and underlies that it is indolent.
And it's not ready to get along.
Well, we are not on straw, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a policy on the left, we're not gonna cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue and encourage these 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Lives the Prosperity and OICs recycled to the PS: they've understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth.
Fair tax is when it bans anyone from taking as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its utility.
And once the value of money is exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is, to make the greatest number of troubles.
We are among the richest 20%.
Undoubtedly, also the 20% of households that work most (and create wealth, a part of which is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation must allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or lower arms and live social minima, especially if you have social housing .
Fortunately, the utopias of the Khmer red head cutters have lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to introduce ourselves at the reception or face any trouble.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and leave.
From now on it will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people ...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Oh, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just missed your luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
In its discharge, the Airbnb response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complain that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as well as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I intend to pay a deposit and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," the Bu$herie sang on every tone...
So, harmless weapons.
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for families and relatives of thousands of Khalabja-dead Kurds to learn that their parents and friends have fallen apart from the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polished).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not overly clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine.
You think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education
It is never time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is this the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were employed 35 hours instead of 17.
Right now, our teachers are winning more than engineers.
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen because National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Besides, it's so the board at 5:00 a.m. and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to catch uneducated dogs whose parents spit at you by treating you like a brandy?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurd population can grow better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely made it through.
My first graduate job was in the sale in London to earn three times nothing and it was a job for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London metro, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not worry if you do not find a qualified job, try to find something that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had remained in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan
I don't like work in the company so much, so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bison rivers like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what is known as the degrees of unemployed.
I have one of those degrees and finished the production manager.
It turned out that the important was not the diploma but, as the article says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Although the starting salary was lower, the steps are quickly raised because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering / artistic studies has lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people so they can get results.
Letters, philosophy, and art are bison rivers?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about the gender studies of the media, or whatever the absurd line you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to de-embark Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see very well the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and the Val-d'Oise making 80km on their way back every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The intramural and small belt inhabitants already have many other more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and turnkey parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be located on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
It is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
As much as they benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find any room for A ONLY bike attachment device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë...
Well, it's not okay at all.
When talking with pedestrians and other users of public transport about the reasons why they don't pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it's too dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and get rid of the survival of bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the cycle tracks are Pis go, you have to reduce the car traffic (urban load type congestion), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), ensure the code of the road by systematically verbalizing (even the bikes to the beemol near that you have to adapt the code of the written road for bannels 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the clots, not before the bannels and scooters do not gene.
The cycle paths are of apartheid, you have to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Greater Paris?
Not a word on the place of bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% Velo relocations is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
After what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the rocket starts, it would be better to find who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure to like the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, complaints should be filed first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault is the responsibility of the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down before, Ukraine launched into the area of air attacks against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent people to ensure that airlines pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpating government / the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate wholesale that Putin killed flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
Call yourself Ricardo and be such a beoten in the eco, that's scary!
Calling Polar is losing the north is joyful.
Only one beotic question: Is today's poor is poorer than yesterday's poor?
I can't help but notice that those who most virtually criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
He shows that today's concentration of capital joins that of the beginning of the 20° before 1914, he shows that it is the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You don't say anything.
I ask you how long it took you to read this path, knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis the press has given is correct or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without having read the book, the essence of which is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you taken to read it?
Is the central thesis of its paved, summarized by the press, false?
I haven't read and won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me to be pure smoke.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not been enriched globally?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just starting to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular areas of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom, but said that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Malala herself is not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You are a terrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't gonna marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father ran a school where girls were educated and he was in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, to receive higher education and to have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, since he thinks that women are the same as men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl must often get married at the age of 14, without having to say her word.
I'm sorry she didn't put it in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who clearly has a bit of trouble finding her sosie character from Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A first fascinating episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is simply stunning.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd like to have a look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of staged productions and mountings that set me up.
In AHS we have an avalanche of original plans that ridiculously mocks the aceptation of today's productions.
It escapes me a little from seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to measure the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but you say it so well, there are many other things.
No it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really UN of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it'll end up like 24 hours of time.
But everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say "I will not look anymore" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here's just my opinion.
Let's talk about less tax increases, please - let's cut instead in government spending.
No, let's increase spending, please.
Those who wanted to shatter in spending failed.
To trigger polemics about relatively small spending positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call their wishes and for some time, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditures.
The "debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
"indebtedness" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government owning a third of my income (before even talking about taxes on consumption) if I thought it would be useful.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the almost useless wind farm subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that seems to make the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem quite ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10 000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns 35 000 £ per year will pay about 5,000 £ (one seventh of their salary), someone with 50,000 £ would pay around 10,000 £ (one fifth), etc. and someone with 200,000 £ pays about £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
No, it's not a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But do not pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are spent.
How can a unemployed person looking for work at the door door prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed were not looking, that means 80% are looking and not finding.
Being myself a unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances all the more.
Indeed, I haven't had any news from Employment Point for months, which means that the officers are more busy with control operations than actually sending back job advertisements?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we must move from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had a case in Pôle Emploi, my rights to ARE had been badly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it had to be fought firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Fichage and control currently takes over, while statutoryly the Employment Centre is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, it is they who pay the side payments.
Non-salary French and politics grant themselves rights that they don't actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that unemployment insurance is worthy to contribute to the valorization of employed labour.
More than waiting for tweets of assassins in Arabic...
In reality we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then look like the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning this year the Hadj to Mecca with Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim coming from Bosnia who contracted varicoseum to Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same mental presence.
Is it a heartless proposal to stop the people in Ebola from flying for Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those "knowing" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be quarantined strictly.
Nobody's coming out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not drastic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa even though they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he can pass on the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt it is able to build in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still a long way from this concept.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, coming out of the deer, has been leading our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the interest in becoming a first Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would anyway not put their feet on the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the notion of sin, too "anxiogene"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision of France.
And in the world, it may be that it will make it possible to touch more world...
@Martin E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you consider it existed to the Christian.
Hillel a century before him already said: "Do not do to others what you do not want to do to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces agapê.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate to buy this, the new game Alien, or Wasteland 2.
And the new game Elite is coming out soon.
It doesn't make up.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fund-raising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll watch.
Obviously not at work.
The jubilee of the IT department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% reduction, or does £30 include 20% reduction?
Attention, however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card *does the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, 35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll take him out of your library if they decide to get rid of the people who buy him there while they're out of the planned area.

So, in 1940, was France a "putrid land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
It must be loved by France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel of Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese, or Australians will read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobeles are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its right value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to visit Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel of Literature: H.
Pinter en 2005, D.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Since I drove one of them to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or fit me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorite.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a buddy to play the Nine Card brag.
Thanks to a real starter chance, I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as bright as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to bother you, I think you're getting away from the subject.
This famous whole, it bans the quests for jihadists when they leave the mosques.
She will immediately report arms trafficking.
Either we have big open eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker, or we have big closed eyes.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sensation: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, both Muslim and non-Muslim, who have formally condemned the EI and its crimes, French, Muslim or non-Muslim, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who says no consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, Mr Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to question.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the criminalization of French society.
If there is no doubt, that is what to say .
Who doesn't say yes, but consents to what?
Agrees to a proximity with EI or to the conviction of EI.
Silence is good practice, it is the main weapon of those who want to clean the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "reveal" the parties represented in Westminster during the elections because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do what they want with impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he saved his party but that he did not realize that he signed the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
It is not surprising that some Labour MPs ask for accounts from their leaders.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think it's rather important.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Around 8% at the expense of 85%, it is not a great election strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs can no longer vote on subjects relating to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband is.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and he did it well.
However, he is still in the league to be Prime Minister in 2015 and what since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's good as the world.
It's very stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books, or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a handkerchief.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am avid of the generalized abdication of users to the generalized appropriation of their privacy.
At your public library, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably deceptive.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
Harvesting is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo, which does not allow either readers or authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all this information, he does.
There have been so many exaggerated, incorrect and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
Interestingly, some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it wins anything.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on her blog: "The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the diplomatic commitment of Iran and the United States concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region".
Indian Punchline's reading is to be strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to cranials balanced by traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read bearing in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran to propose from Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are those "moderate" who are seriously fighting the terrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world toward the abime and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" nonexistent to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
"It's even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I got one in my head.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we "should"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy.
Wouldn't criminals just be old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Especially concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by revenge by Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a vacuumed place from Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
That's crazy!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain the contact with the real.
I don't think so.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples may have been simply a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile heterocouples, too.
What about the kids!
What a shame to call them future psychological imbalance.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine known to our world.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and brought to the world children who were not their husbands.
That's how it is, we're done...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "merchandization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they just as marketers of the bodies?!
Anachronic Vessel Unit ...
It is certainly more elegant to have a good encroached in distant countries via the Internet and Pay Pal than to put its responsibilities and avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting at it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were also not done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this from afar.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there the night!
But if you like it and listen to the music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many disdainful comments about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about the foot waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
Nothing surprising that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampireized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but this is a small article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Victoria Wigan / Exchange and go down to Wallgate.
And goblins.
Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Ghent entitled Gentle Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more dangerous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy the colony (by the way, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative rose angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) said: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not drop the guard ...
That it bothers the anti-Israeli that is obvious, that is not the goal sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered, I translated: the world geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since politics is globalized ...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, that is certain to continue!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of force allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestine conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything they don't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyists written by no others.
This proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old girl likes her, which would say it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says some truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be more and more widespread!
I can understand why some Horripile Brand: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting was completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that he just tells people not to vote and rather to cross the arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that once every five years vote for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing mainly for special interests, multinational corporations and the rich, At no time does he simply say to completely ignore politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disengage for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter what and try to influence politics from that.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians will change the mind if they really lose the elections), but it is heartening to see all these condescending answers saying that this imbecile that makes Jesus tells young people not to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really distorts his arguments.
Its solution is extremely debatable and it would be good if people were debating what he really said rather than simply labeling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote thing was completely distorted.
It is useless to slip a ballot in a ballot box every five years to make me deeply nervous, since my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and those who account locally for their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's statements are not his (written by others).
It is intelligent enough to have its own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-established thinkers and university that Suzanne would like to group under the label " pseudo-chomskyists".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headlifts added to the mount!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It derives from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "fronde" shows, above all, that the intellectual debate has long since been held in the RDVs of history, where trade historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have declined to the benefit of a condensed Science Po type of loan for press records.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take care of a guilty, a scapegoat.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these emissary scapegoats that are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that Foucault's state was essential as a guilty person.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magic thought.
We solve the problem of the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or /liberary slope ( of the two terms the second mark a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing going to seek State aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Who pleads guilty, who condemns, who kills, who sacrifices.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not a support from the outside.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of his god Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too soon if you took the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet has a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the hard left humanities who do not support the fact that we are going from allergy to their mantras, is quite risky.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think like whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-Blanc statements.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter comes out with a white one.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they are very fortunate to be exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River, Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australian opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, when I met two in my life (one of which is abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice that's the only reason I remember them being Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all the people are worth it, how we remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the said White.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would attack them PHYSICALally.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: Forgive me, but the judiciary is frankly rightful.
When the Union of the Judiciary, it represents only 25% of judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of the proportionality of law enforcement in the courts, it orders that two obstacles be removed.
That of the observer's political vision as well as that of the judge's factual interpretation.
It is then the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be pointless to claim that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Pretention and ignorance are not an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics implicitly revealing that it is leaving from a low point of view.
The previous preamble allows for the following to be included in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary*.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the harmful power* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field under consideration is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed to the procedure through fraud* by successive genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession is awarded EUR 150 million a year, while benefiting from the coverage provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this coincides with that statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and reluctant heirs to do so, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics that ignores these rational criteria not at that time a form of lie developed?
Certainly totally prohibitive prices.
Still equipment to scam people with disabilities.
One can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built to suit his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could not.
As we say, the sounds and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like the EPIC.
I don't think the Whill inventor ever had to clean a dog's pancake on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the way, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard slope.
Here are some hills that would please them.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle of all terrain seems to me particularly useful.
Not all persons with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know very well that we need them.
We can't really say the Wyll is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the wheelchair "long distance" doesn't arrive on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this fucking thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been imprisoned from the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people who are under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds lived their lives under Israeli blockade!
The unique situation in the world, unacceptable, illegal, too, as this blockade imposes a “collective penalty” on all Gazan civilians.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects move a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
It's not a wooden tongue, it's a concrete and it's an army of the lady.
References are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's a black market that's certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been imprisoned from the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
A unique world situation, unacceptable to anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that after raising it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am an Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built across from the population who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
A lot of people are only looking for a one-night shot at Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thereby bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
"What does she rent on?"
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in line with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that the ships can be moved, stolen and re-run, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or diverted by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to start it?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get worse!
High finance, speculating, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, so our food, so our food, so our health care structures, so our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economy from Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else to compete?
What do you call that? Return his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee has really "rejected" the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook-up in the area.
The sea was hollow at the beginning of the day; I don't know if this was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, in the pictures showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm sea and in the full daylight.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading on this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipédia:
"Some confusion reigned among German ships as to the fate of the two leathered cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped shooting, and a fury race began.
The Leipzig saw something in the fire, but when it came close it saw that it was only a wreck.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, bent and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlamps on the ship's flag, the proposal to travel was refused and he opened the fire, finally sliding the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22:15.
Concerned about reports of a British cook's ass in the surrounding areas, he went north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, working in the dark before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had been sinking, and therefore couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy cage in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they fought to take advantage of their advance.
They were far away from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them to be wrong and had cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes rose at the UMP to request that it be included in the law that an elected person who has been definitively convicted be, therefore, permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing elected officials well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS, I RECOMMEND AN INCRIPTION TO THE MUR OF MAGISTRATES' CONSTITUTION
What about the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated?
As a result of political cards whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to ameliorate those themselves who will benefit from their immovability in order to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are actually trying to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is measured by their lack.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs" of the bases for justice" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members have the enormous power to hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same ideas if right-wing, or extreme-right-wing, trade unions were to target the people on its side and to wage a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free of charge.
If, at present, the right hand holds the legal news, it is simply that she has done the facts that follow it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the subject of its attention have not had a favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the union of the judiciary which is left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is minority.
A minister's commitment to the trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote may be a minority among judges, but its influence is great in Chancery, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the "mission" of some judges is no more salient than instructing.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that judges are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants never came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry bastard of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills the stages of the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Creyl Cole, which in fact is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, have all participated in Eurovision, as have many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some fell into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars who don't participate in the contests.
Few of them, after a tube, manage to make others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a football player who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical way of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar fries that smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even getting out an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it sets a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that is moving fast enough to racism, because the sacramental ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual bigoterie, while most of their ways of doing so are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations in everyday life.
Unless you interpret imprudibly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is without a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco ephemeral to move the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the spells not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When did a critic compare disciplines to make you laugh?
Because what is valid for archaeology is also valid for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would provide a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to rebuild history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and the archaeologists used to rely on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are there in full (and old) polemics on shamanism advanced by prehistory Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Leschamanes de la prehistoire", especially the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, published at the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this article very instructive
Heteros like anal sex?
For you Mike, I could get in there.
So we're done?
I don't really understand Why can't we go on to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cavalry?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, on the other hand, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, courageous, so that they write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
It's not like you're laughing with those fucking ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then go ahead.
If you're so shocked by these "pure-ass jokes," you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video amateur crash on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. a expander) would have entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they're protecting the pilots.
Well, I also share this view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to reboot the English that led then...
You're letting yourself on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's no big deal, I've got a little time to get rid of all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracys in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant history of the possibility of winning one pilot to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that pulls out the safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of the image allows the FIA to avoid the embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner is shaking a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag agitated, sign that the race can return normally and that one is more under yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark meconaissance of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
It's the usual procedure.
The station of clerks just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be at 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) stirs the green to tell the pilots to take back a normal look.
Sensationalism sells the pub.
Before I thought that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information is exactly the same.
Making the buzz with info that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep making people afraid so they can continue to control them.
"When tabloids allude to Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "dangerous", not "allesent".
Given the medical reference, " coughing" is much better said in this context than " derailing".
I wonder if all the people who claim that Ebola could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that makes a nice and solid mockery of this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I'm depressed that the media are talking about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) so the government can get us out when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic about the idea of managing by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
In addition at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with certainty to spend years there .....
Testimonial perfectly unnecessary.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only does the testimony serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as a scientific material.
Perhaps that's why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record indicates that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base your research on?
In fantasy?
Are you setting the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
"Resilience": the word canon auduled by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delirue, who think for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psy.
Cyrulnik hit us with "resilience."
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have cut us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to take out the Air Sentinels...
And why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who brought it out are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to all who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humor type pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for kids.
The children hung up.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and the animation is done well. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (even though being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to redistribute the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and we can always see it at these times.
And the episodes of half an hour are now at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "bad" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The hill of the temple if there is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentinian?
This mount is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its peak, or dome of the Rock, is in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Mahomet ascended to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the moment she was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind him regularly, and they are unfortunately relegated to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in two states, and approached it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is not.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To praise us for the tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïds half-naïds on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's still a little scared.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
Too bad the photographer from Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to rock the Jewish faithful down below, praying to the Wall of Lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is untenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seemed to go wild, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not acceptable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really talk with one voice.
Instead of raging and groaning when someone else does the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that we do not embarrass people impenetrably.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is acceptable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (TPCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you understand what's going on in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat, and tears"?
This makes excellent returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link is likely to be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, at XVIII there were unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let that (in the end, his officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the country's decline, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more uncomfortable...
They still miss you the benticat s of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know anything yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll join you.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
The protection professions with trade unions have already been sufficiently affected for the defence of class interests, which has resulted in a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
It is requested not to laugh about the fear of risk by an employee.
One can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If you don't, we'll have a disaster.
And with the carts in preparation, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
In fact, ignorance...
I ignored Sybille's ignorance, I made reference to the military and other officials, as this is the subject here commented on...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely essential with the breakdown of the informational power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review". ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (how misleading it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, from tarte mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It is the second time in a row that strangely, the show ends with a win of the worse baker; no one has made a kind of "boom, here's my fucking cake now drink it and incite yourself in front of your master"!
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept apart.
And there is also this idea of "playing safety, there is always next week" which disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine putting this on me.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to get started, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not give way, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that a number of challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time taken.
There is also cancer, with solar blows.
Clearly, everything is happening right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You are confused with solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is precisely formed by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have an interest in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and lets the UVA and most UVBs pass.
You know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor to be a deadlock when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was subordinated in the commentary, which himself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanoma habit, UVs are only accepting its development.
They're not gonna do it.
For proof: not all bronzed people have melanomas.
Either, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because the UV is necessary for everything human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, most importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or go to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that anything can be folded if there is sufficient force applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think that the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as the first-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
That's a good choice.
the majority of those interested have established that anything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it
Except for the Nokia 3310.
More specifically, has he already folded?
We make that joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth joke about folding I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production line and we see little how it could return there.
So, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is thus stuck with the plant test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrial industry is producing in »industrial' We put forward super u but all the signs and meme the small trade are concerned How do we feed good, organic ac 1650€ (average salary in French)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, feeding is one.
I'll kiss you. I'll kiss you.
Bobos, or better boboecoles, are called people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total unbundling of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining in this the left caviar, of which they have sometimes emerged, for example by condemning CO2 releases while passing their holidays to Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferie as well as be surprised to often encounter criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the details associated (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find myself.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecoles are monobloc.
Did you understand the left-wing caviar concept?
Well, you're able to understand the Boboécolo concept.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were to become involved in the short-term economy.
The boboécolo is part of it, but only represents the most visible fringe of the ecoloists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so badly made that she looks vaguely like a female naked.
Shit, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy in making a comment because you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, he's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic dog reproductions that smoke by playing the pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're only looking for this, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to make savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
The (honour of honesty requires that France reduces its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes more drasticly, to begin with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuariization?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look where else to make savings but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gebang is certain.
Let all those who have sided little or proud the military thing dare come and say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting laughs...
That the same potion is applied to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cool: look at the inflation of public employment in other departments and you will understand why Defence can be a little busy!
Well, the economies everyone agrees on saying we have to do them, do we have to do it somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groaning at the murder when it happens to them, the poor cheris.
It would be necessary to do this, but above all, it would not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
What closes the Val de Grace will weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story is repeated at every job closure, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a mayor of the UMP who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public expenditure.
This article is really the happiest thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people commenting make the same bad joke.
It is the depression to have his Facebook wire scrolled and to see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He will surely be based on brilliant scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus going to work and only realizes that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author assumes the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you expect your comment to be at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie really just demonstrated that he's at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling down!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that flowed from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was really bad.
Especially if it's neither women nor cross-sections.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the development of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until again, we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states playing the tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Windmills and solar farms are tomorrow's Round Points.
All financed by the contributor.
I ask you to stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from wind or PV renewables is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
Replace the nuclear with wind or PV would run counter to the CO2 control.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in physical sciences 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove otherwise what I said.
For what I didn't say it is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all right-wing people to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a cost-effective and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the water vapour with a lower greenhouse gas effect than the Co2 it is true to recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of the water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!
Last time, Pakistan won against the Hindu.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified India as a giant from South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandora box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletico standing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the cricket of the IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "noiseing neighbours"...
The low cost launcher is paying for cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a fault of design, but of implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private society, it seems that Soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here state is its own insurer..
They may be paying for the frigate satellites that know.
This is all the more unfortunate because many media recapture the only titles of articles - and many readers take only those titles.
In total, this creates an incorrect impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
It is not right to agree with you that the title is not appropriate, it is unfairly challenging the project, whereas it is only a launcher's problem.
