No liberating amendments to Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced in the context of a revision of the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-Prime Ministers, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the motion for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October because of the conclusion of an alleged adverse agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet valid, and in December the appeal of the convicted to the court is to be dealt with.
Timoshenko himself calls the sentence the political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial made the suspicions of the bias of the court arise.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Ex-Prime Minister was sentenced from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the elections Islamists win, the question is only which - the moderated or the radical.
The National Transitional Council became acquainted with the customary law of the Shar, of which one has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without criminality, because for theft one hacks off the hand in short.
Women, too, should forget the thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, possibly apostates, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society from mutually opposing tribes will in future be united by the Qur'an.
In short - an order will prevail in Libya, which in this country would hardly be conceivable and, above all, would hardly be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the above-mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather curious that the Moslem fighters were ever helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse may serve only the fact that NATO's air attacks were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not part of it.
We only participated in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians dismissed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
This causes the locals a concern - namely the displacement of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without occupation?
The West can hardly boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights at last.
If this do not destroy the people of Sharah.
The beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a Europe-wide statistical storm was blowing.
The individual countries published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market is picking up all the records.
Investors keep an eye on not only Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which of France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had been originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France allowed a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, thus confirming the trend of the slowdown in economic performance.
The results are thus worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 per cent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analyst expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds rose by 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to experience problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are being cast to make the ECB the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well laid out goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jir theek she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was thus able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missed at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge proportion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jir theek in Montenegro, the Czech team also won a very happy 1:0 and thus won their tickets for the football championship.
Due to the precise defense game of the Czech team they also put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad luckbirds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who lost two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed at the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that home football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was mainly played around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home team continued and the large discounts in front of the penalty room were successfully rejected by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday afternoon and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it clear that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran seems to have long since abandoned its nuclear weapons efforts.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the case of an attack aimed at making the Iranian nuclear programme paralysing as much as possible, the centre in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fat child: It does not breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9% of all students and 5% of all children overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that adipose children usually come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
So it turns out once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had an evening meal on the day before the education campaign under the motto "Adipositas is No Accident".
In families with Dickerchen, sport is not just one of the favourite jobs, however, the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active exercise.
Survey of children under 900
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools being interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
Up to now, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frightening increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed said, for example, five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast lunch-vesper evening bread - one of the main conditions for healthy eating," that is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the pupils' families.
And - in most families everyone breakfasts alone.
The worst finding was that every tenth family does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is regarded as the cornerstone of healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children consume much more unhealthy apples.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are engaged in sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 per cent.
Set your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (104 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own menus based on their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet limonads", is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunchtime, i.e. the main court, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"The survey participants' control group, which completed the questionnaire following the conclusion of the explanatory lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", has in many cases been subject to a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition", is mentioned in the project results.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed many poultry or fish as the main dish of the day in the questionnaire and were ready to eat less noodles or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had made a bit of sense that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "place" is running.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the exam goes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (no one is taking part in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportional figure.
And that's after all most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other a too young figure without proper curves and again others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually hide wide shoulders, extend the neck or to enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figurine-like, without her acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are simply unpayable.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bars that always slips up and down, in the waist, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, constructions, applications, embroidery or raffles.
With that amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do it in view of the task of the house.
Each of the participants was awarded a prize, for which she should design suitable outfits - daywear and evening dress.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos recently (after all, this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or look for them on the Internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design are then to be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist attracts the models not only purely physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's only Sunday.
That means that a stylist has to have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on character types, was also spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that this should be a stylist capable of exploiting it.
And a sent-in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a separate coat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to put up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice was given to me: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Then you may hurt her first," said Jakub.
Finally, I can see why we need to break all these lessons, what you can combine with what you can, and why, even if you often get to see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion looks.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this when designing the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be out-of-money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to have a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to go Google to find with certainty that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding Promi has returned to or dropped, etc.
On Sunday Jan and Mario put us in the heart of not believing that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "to assemble" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate above all with the people he steals and he must be a bent psychologist.
Evaluate people without offering themselves and with his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to view her wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't clear her entire closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things that you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must include.
So that's a bag that you tapped at the waist and carried with you all the necessary possessions.
Apart from such clear things as scissors, detachables for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is taken behind if it is too large (sticks or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric is not broken) and, of course, sewing.
But so that we could not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to put under shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the soles of the shoes, let alone the outside.
We o glued and we glued...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate itself to styling at a professional level is not a child's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally careless ride becomes due to a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes to the routine journey to the early layer.
Although it was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, what is the point of doing so already if no one obviously wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the counter, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already old game series "Need for speed" back to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the adapted passages in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're already used to it at NFS, in the end it's a lot different than you expected.
Certainly - potentially it is quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are no mistakes anymore, but rather signs of the basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, the story is introduced, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you're on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is played on another track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One has no moment the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumn landscape or up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Sometimes untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts vision.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to make sure that you are not thrown away by a avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well built.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are going to do. They want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that in the game there are far fewer such passages than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations needs to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model is still very well suited for an action-loaded race, although the competition could be improved.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems arise only after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it computes complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When passing through or passing on opposite cars, the other cars are "tipped" in some places only easily, but in others, almost identical situation, you get into the slip and turn wild pirouettes.
Or take the cart to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's annoying all the time.
The restarts are solved in such a way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, it's all starting from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in the case that something doesn't work, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the restart helps, since nothing else helps to learn from the critical section of the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to be run through in a very specific way, or you simply don't fit through.
Where you meet "civil" cars at the appropriate point, you always have the same configuration, no matter if you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes in front of one playing on two approaching cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that it always gets close to your nose to this situation.
The opponents have further advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent and again here without regard for the timing.
At the craziest, this is at the conclusion of the game on the long bridge, which you pass in opposite direction.
The opponent must overtake one of us here, apparently, to the devil.
And if he's already in front of you, he'll take a look at you, of course, so you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it avoids the joy of the game quickly.
And that's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in some cases, it's also so loaded that you almost don't know where one's head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what it is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't get bored, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the races.
You must not miss the filling stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you have right now is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentine in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the mode of game history also goes the task mode (requests) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience to gain for one's own profile, which is common to the tasks (requests) and history.
In order to get to the higher level of driver, various objects have to be unlocked: starting from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is combined with the online Autolog feature, which compares its own results with other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car to a subway tunnel (meinetwegen) where you rest on the rails in the dark (meinetwegen).
On the tacho you can see numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (menet roads), but there is one single metro coming from the back and driving an uncompromised to scrap.
In our editorial, we will probably argue for a long time about whether that was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the frequency of repeat images becomes slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a larger number of stakeholders, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound reproduction is as far as OK and the soundtrack is taste.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "everything" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game would not be damaged by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to look at those mistakes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Same Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversität
The Festa Academica festival now offers for the third time the addition of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and its musical experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional choirs and university choirs are presented.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that will take place on 17 November.
"The Karlsuniversität has a large part to play in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Human Studies is also represented among the participants and the festival committee is also attended by Rector Václav Hampl," led by the head of the organizing team Jakub Čaloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist choirs, which takes place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program features the composition of the important Czech jazzist Karel R theička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the velvet revolution" (Studenty Sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where the choir also occurs, choirs of Karlsuniversität are not excluded.
Festa Academica sets the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of Karlsuniversität, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
In addition to concerts, the schedule includes numerous music meetings, student-happanings, matinees and other events.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions out of the blue."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five to six years for the waves to smooth and all to become accustomed to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, rather sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Intellectual and open Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have enjoyed such a number of readers of the Faculty of Law of Karlsuniversität.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was expressed that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who didn't have such a role, but I have to say that it made everyone feel bad about how well he thought about it.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them and, above all, have clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy she then explained as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards reaching an agreement and better readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil cap quartz
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negativity which had seriously affected the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
The Ambassador said that not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, were quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's gruesome abbreviations, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether you really have cramps in Brussels or round cucumbers and various large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban us from the quargel?
It would also have liked to use the EU's land to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or more speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more negative than positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
Apart from the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, known as V4.
"Believe me when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman says next to me: "Hey, what are you together - is this your V4 again?" and in doing so makes a pretty sour face.
Ms Vicenové said that in future, the EU would expect above all tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more realistic than a "European Federation".
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries away from the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only the countries that want it to work together and those that don't want it to work together should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately go beyond a strong "Europe of different speeds", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the IBM strategy is most precisely characterized, then this would probably be the word "longness".
For the general public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its foundation has already been deleted a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he represented the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was first published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
A thoughtful system
In the 1930s, Watson had already taken social care of his employees - in a similar way as the Ba the entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thoughtful remuneration system for the best newcomers and dealers.
The long-term relationships between IBM and its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in promoting talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is also a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has taken the position of Chief Sales Officer, Marketing and Strategy Officer.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this both inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technologies," added George Colony from Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present in the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the States of their logo because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars in market capitalization, IBM was the second largest technology company this year (at the same time to Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
Unlike the antiplayer Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
The vast majority of IBM's profits involve services, software and hardware in one fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the largest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it has invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future technologies.
IBM continues to invest in these investments after 2008, when the modern-day financial crisis for the first time passed through the world like a storm.
Also here IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great World Economic Crisis.
So far, IBM seems to survive the current crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased 120 percent since 2008, and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - not just the values.
This is also why it is expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to all-world flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had initially a rather complicated name - Computing Tablating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally it was a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the future company IBM laid the foundation for the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous card clocks to register the beginning and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of this new company, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put IBM's founders in the shadow - on Watson's ideas is still based on the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already revealed by the name, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cashing.
In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM of NASA helped lead flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came onto the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered the business with high value-added consulting services and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It expresses the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform, which aims to help traders to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia at that time - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates, among other things, a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top world-level research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rycht ‘ová’ over her disloyal husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht theová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rycht the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) became their lover, Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rycht theová.
When Darina Rycht the singer I. Bartošová had ordered refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have fallen into the dream of how to deal with her husband.
When Iveta moved on her press after 30 days and went back to  the city, Joseph went with him immediately.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
With time Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
It doesn't matter who sleeps with his wife
If Iveta Bartošová was to leave in the future, then he will surely not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to finish his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties," Ms. Rycht theová told; she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Joseph has so far borne dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rycht, "Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her from doing so.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take on all responsibility.
The worst female insults: What about you?
When men are called upon to call some typical female pests, they shake without exception some promptly out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines in which we let happen a few ounces review again that let men wall the blood in the veins?
Shopping Search
Is it their intention for them to be shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more for promotions?
Then in your case, it's probably really about a weakness.
At least some women are aware of this and try to keep their shopping half way under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman does it take to stroll through a dress shop in search of a well-sitting upper garment and not try out all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you'd rather stay out...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd have to lose at least five kilos - should I start to jog or do gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Is that somehow known to them?
Yeah?
Then you must also be among the women who are truly possessed of what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, protect the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you mess with her partner, because he is walking with dirty shoes on the clean tiles again, and you care for the children, because the just shaved sink is already dirty again, and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, even though polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that there is nothing to exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not paramount.
This immeasurably clean mold can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, rest in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty Turnpants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a Tired, you must not wonder that it brings him to the palm tree.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew that, then the women might not have had to do so much.
Plaice and trachea
Some women like to plow and plow, as they are stomped behind their backs, slandered or forged, or forged.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to smile through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of harmless chatter and tratsch in stock.
Hands in the heart - that's probably all women own.
But this is not to be confused with the roughest calibers, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a significant danger to women's collectives in particular.
Jágr and Vor theek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had two assists in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The winner of the overview of the nine and thirty-year-old hockey star was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player in the match.
Jágr's co-player Jakub Vor the following two assists in the same game.
Jágr claimed after the game against journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Already before the game, I'll tell him he's got a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"There is such a feeling over and over again," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux reached a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
In front of the court of the Hurricanes, he fought the puck and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot among the circles.
A second before the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third belonged to the flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds drove his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought in life that at the end of my career I'd be playing with such an ice hockey player as he did."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear turns around," Jágr said.
Carolina made game another drama - through the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who won a penalty shot, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was in surplus two against one.
"Excellent prongs still active in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took the ride up and (read) moved to a more distant post."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad he did it," said Vor the last hit of the party from his point of view.
The victory put Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and broke out in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience with Beck, the candiers also lost their lead in the penalty shooting 2:3.
Tom the Plekanec was unable to convert one of the criminal charges.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defense players to end.
"That's bad."
"We only ended the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done about that," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we changed, an attack wave after each other and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P.K. Subban, one of the defenses.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
In the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a stake.
Developments in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sports Tourist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries at the time, and only chosen ones were allowed to travel to the West at the time.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period 1962-72, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Already at that time the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange practice - the condition for an exit to the West - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The Saturday revolution of 1989 followed a journey revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays last year in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligations were abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted at least a few days to be there.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the park when travelling to Paris in the tent, because at that time, who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a guest house.
A typical feature of travel abroad by Czechs was then a packed trunk with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus the average wages also increased, which led to a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights after 1997, which, thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts, made flight travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-general" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to far distant sunny countries each year; twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the USA lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely included our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 CZK per capita for a single vacation including the cost of the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again threatens a patt.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement as to which electoral order to vote on.
And without this, there is no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom the Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, asking his colleagues to come to an agreement and to find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old queues broke out again between the two association chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out sharp and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Volkshaus in Smíchov, Prague, for the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the plenary session - only the constitutional representatives or also the officials with a power of attorney.
At least some agreement was reached on this single point, which was also reflected in the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in the opinion of the latter, was not authorized to represent on a proxy basis.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue to take place.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity to the matter, the meetings of which, whether ordinary or extraordinary, are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgical point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three FAČR Vice Presidents, who represents professional football in management.
According to a law-abiding model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the Chamber for which he is applying wins.
Moravia is said to be prepared to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, on the other hand, is based on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast in this percentage.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which found it best not to add the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Mr Paclík agrees with this, even though the constitutional electoral system is most likely to be opposed to Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is for the most part to be elected after the Statute."
"This does not mean that there are no absurd alternatives, as was the case at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze the first time that he applied and distinguished himself from Pelta in his opinions.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, Nymburk will be known to the new chairman and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football EM today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says Jablonec, a member of staff who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts, at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, confusing."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "prove" the rules for their own purposes."
"For this reason, further blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides remains.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start at all in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and so it was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee was still to be taken to the location of the barrage playoff.
At the end of the day, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have led the split parties to an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the confidentiality of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Meeting of ČSTV, which is to point the new direction for Czech sport in the light of Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík is going into the fight for the position of the president because he does not see any suitable candidates
If, before the extraordinary General Meeting, Tom the Head of Pilsner Football had been able to make a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all of his ideas about the new chair of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have taken up the battle for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he will only exercise the role of chairman for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager, who is not too much stuck in the football event.
"I have spoken to some people in question personally."
"To believe that some said to me, they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta in the position of President.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and the Czech football would not go any further at all."
"The support from Berbr, a smart businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell in a corruption case some time ago in connection with phone hearings, but Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his former statement, "he'll sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta becomes chairman", but he'll see something more relaxed.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, however, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, thinks that he ended with a fiasco.
"He (Petta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I am not involved in matters of which I do not understand," said Paclík, who, in September, had made it clear that he was in the lead behind the dismissal of the arbitration commission with Lu the Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the president of the association has grown.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which can take place even in harsh situations," said Paclik, who does not make a hooligan out of his antipathy, for example, towards the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help him lobby the top political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, but then they also have to cut and say clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to Pilsner Klub also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR must be "superparty".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense, in my opinion, to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return again after one and a half years," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would trigger a patt-situation in the future.
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election he would make a strong commitment to obtaining new Statutes for the FAČR, which in future would exclude disputes over the electoral order from the front.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself if the Czech election succeeds.
Pelta had promised to concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election before the unrealised election in September.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, says the man, who is mainly connected to the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June Statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as all of them had adopted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chair since September," Pelta said.
In particular, the revision of the most important civil society document he used as a means of locking the delegates.
"If I become chairman, then I take it personally and am ready to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not attempt to limit himself against his opponents.
He had already announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his counter-applicant would be his first alternate.
He also did not attack him for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he moves for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were downsetting and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclaimations, which he already said in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this was supposed to be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"I would then fall for negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the work content of all the employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness can be understood.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point to choose in the third round should be then we get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chair of the Czech Football Association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly leave many people in the association with the mood.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to increase money in football and otherwise to continue the work that the previous Chairman Ivan Hašek had begun.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in conversation with ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to share hard tasks to make football progress in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted because, instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered that no longer can be applied at all.
"I'm known to be working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me, who don't unrelentingly throw a button between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because otherwise it would do others."
"That's trust you can't play with," he said.
Apparently, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work, and I don't want to just throw that away."
"Processes were started, probably only in a few years' time, and I would just hate to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I think you can accuse me of some things, but not that I'm biased."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then went up into the first league each."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moorish clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the leader of the Pilsner Club Tom the Paclík has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the Lottery Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames the association for not pulling a single strand.
While saying of Pelta, "he has been disqualified from the outset to help Czech football achieve new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has started, and he would obviously not change the staff of the Commission in principle."
He would certainly not want to bow things to his favor," says Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Anyone traveling through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one of her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artistically designed domes, she swam across marble putten waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and marveled at the art-style swimming halls that were beautifully restored.
Liked her a bath, she took it flying in her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each visited a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport they don't have much on their hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Annoyingly only that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while Jogger can breathe the perturbing scent of fir forests or listen to cheerful bird-wrecks in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
The spa factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have given themselves trouble, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colorful tiles, spring boards.
On 190 pages, the small-format volume "Badefreuden" provides valuable information on the history of architecture and culture of historical wellness oasiss - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder in her researches in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a karst cave (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the entire city is in the eye of Zurich's roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a St. Anton bath - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe driving on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine into his nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so much of heating oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black, and its slick stick to the skin as soon as you can slide into the pool - a special wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed area.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, you have acted against the decline in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already left this bathroom behind; one can discover not only neo-romanic elements from the times of its establishment in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool specialist Iris Meder - not only because she originally came from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different architectural styles into such a great unity," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank clears the raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the CEO will then draw consequences.
Hamburg
For the citizens of Germany, the issue is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks are speculating with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity markets raise prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chancellor Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to safeguard traders against price fluctuations.
But by now most experts agree that the Zockers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profit.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "worthy to put the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the bank's head then wants to tell us what the consequences are.
In the end, a reduction of the raw material business could be, or even the complete turnaround.
Ackermann makes his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices is particularly dramatic in showing how ruthlessly banks are damaging the general good today."
Ackermann is now particularly committed to being the top banking lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter if Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the Deutsche Bank's reputation."
The insight of Ackermann comes as a surprise at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the Chief Executive Officer will not switch to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shave - that would ultimately have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa interviewed 1001 people on November 7th and 8th.
Just 11 percent therefore think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, each second would terminate all facilities in which money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent indicated that they would think about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Wien
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern post-war architecture is bloated, with clear forms, glass halls, courageous swans and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler World Exhibition in 1958 is a striking and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annexation in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as temporary exhibition construction, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" it was called.
But the building was not suitable as a museum either spatially or technically - no walls for the hanging of art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called the "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky fall in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere, was established in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a senior art historian with a remarkable career in youth as an ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly implemented the reconstruction among politicians and monument protectors, created public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a book shop, and an office house had to be built for this purpose.
Closer supervision, small state
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "very important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in its transfer to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy slug", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were changed, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass were used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Refrigeration bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish brown rust protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly what it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small state.
"Sometimes a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Monumentary Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building remained flexible and easy.
Hardly had it been with the pavilion "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a true consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building happiness: Around the Swiss garden is just the newly planned "main train station quarter", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky case might still occur: the 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca from Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package at million height
The train has exhausted a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report this year, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than EUR 70 million in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "image" newspaper reported in advance, calling for an in-house crisis plan, that investments by 2015 would total around 300 million euros.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway installations and railway lifts to 16,000 people.
The aim was to free railway platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operations and 90 percent of the necessary routes.
Two months ago, after a summit with the government and industry, Bahn-Chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it must have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions penalty in the USA
After the tumult of Chief Josef Ackermann comes new mess from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants are now also collecting their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes about the collapse of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes that a whole series of large banks have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and took banks to the depths.
"We are pleased that we have been able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not accept any debt with regard to the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCU President Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into Pleiten in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billions of serious damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also tried other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgages in question are so-called "mortgage-backed securities".
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble exploded in 2007, this became a burden for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers re-turned.
Even if the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently experiencing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have made countless claims to obtain redress or to blame for mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest appeal wave.
It proposes 18 large international banks to have over-delivered the two state-funded US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in a volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also file a complaint with the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that Frankfurters be entitled to "substantial losses", but not to mention a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as endless and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies allowed itself to be poorly forecasted.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and creates computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's strike in the financial world.
As a result, IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed in the US economics company CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to be one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM hadn't even known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided good profits.
"They did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett used a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder for example.
His holding, Berkshire Hathaway, also owns approximately 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investment to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
Therefore, he is a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost indisputable sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the buffet investment became known, IBM's share rose by one percent ahead of the stock.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market and is thus one of the world's most valuable technology companies together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so said Buffett, but he doesn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zele" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that now relives.
The murders of eight Turkish-owned and a Greek small entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is being reacted to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, this is a long believed spectre: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turkish people with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there was xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet visible.
"Does bloody ideology resume?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded to the protest: It reminded the victims of racist violence with a alarm clock in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish contract of employment.
In cheerful colours, the co-conspiracy had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media acts like a face-to-face: "Deutschland's Gift for the Fifth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered and that taxes had been paid and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police's actions and their subsequent success are extremely critically discussed.
Why the German authorities did not have much more time to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
At least some are ready for drastic means: "If we continue to sluggish here, there is nothing left for the migrants but self-defense and arms."
"This will probably be the best self-protection".
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What it means when inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks tightened our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen, he sent a note of condolences to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time, as many contributions were made by the Turkish people there.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of extensive awareness-raising and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, open words need to be made this time.
The scandal bank of Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slashed from a crisis into the next one.
Now it should be a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber wouldn't have thought of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up almost as spectacular a new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was delighted publicly, praised Switzerland for their beauty and UBS for their newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A distributor of UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and squeezed about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since also been called upon - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank on February 2012.
And the Chairman of the Board of Directors he will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economist and a notoriety banker and would certainly have had to have had a period of employment.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been tearing from a scandal into the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank spared.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the Swiss asset manager, who was silent and solid, but also bloated, with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, UBS managed more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world in 2007.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she had advanced to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students have always shown the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was going on in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, came back surprisingly, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, one knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment sector had been ticked with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To train this, the UBS announced a capital increase of sage and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, but some of them, who had been so silent to a short time before, had been told: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that one didn't even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, Switzerland's second-best-paid board of directors in 2006.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: The UBS faced the collapse due to its lack of investment in the financial crisis and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced conversion bond that enabled it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Viiger.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared itself willing to release the data of wealthy customers who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions as well as a fine.
Thus, the UBS became more or less open to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
In a few months the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through misconceptions and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back to you, this unsuspecting dealer story follows: A single dealer will swallow 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been noted that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it is not in control of risk control."
It had been exactly the idea of the caution that Swiss bankers had taken a long time to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too great a risk to the security of money - even if the world were to collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The head office of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are stunning, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank and the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS you enter through a heavy turning door.
Inside are the walls covered with marble, before which there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has pushed both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrays how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become much too large, he found it - especially in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits first and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided to take the biggest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the big bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the merger - and continued to grow.
The two different predecessor banks of the UBS helped complement each other: a rich but asleep bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers came to a great deal of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked from the banking teaching up to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Obesity came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the executive meetings, where CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs hit the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps have already been taken.
She played at the top of the foreign exchange business and stock trading.
However, corporate consultants commissioned pointed to a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost it almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and continued securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks themselves.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at the UBS have become a sled seat and are still vacated.
Whoever runs the big bank now has a almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has managed all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end of investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (still) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Schweizer was actually only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated itself from its predecessor grübel.
In the meantime, he has taken over: he is supposed to keep the UBS business permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to take the investment bank back to the level in the mid-nineties.
3500 jobs, he's out.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
Publicly, he only says so far that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The threat of recession in Europe has given the US investors the courage to start the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Draught industrial production on the continent stifled hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass still half full last week, not half empty - but now again the problems were in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales books.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values recorded a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points for the trade close.
In the course of the trade, the market barometer hung between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The wider S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology market lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax adopted itself with a decrease of 1.2 percent for 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is responding to the end of the upswing.
In September, companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there are further signs of the banks' weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early in his view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and initially let him rate it against the trend in the course of trade almost one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of 170 dollars per piece, according to his own data, and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, Bank of America's interest rates were significantly higher than those of the market.
The house silverifies almost the entire rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and for this destroys 6.6 billion dollars.
With the net profit from the business, the institution mainly wants to leverage its capital ratio and comply with more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the Group collected the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 and calculated the value of the orders to 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares were traded.
719 values increased, 2281 returned and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 630 billion shares in sales, 1913 in the minus and 82 in the plus closed unchanged.
Intelligent cranes spread into cities
In many places seeds are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
They like one, they want to get rid of the others very quickly: Crowds have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities the crowds of inhabitants are increasing over the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crops were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first Krähenssymposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory asked for possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also led the problems in cities to the rural flight of particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others, in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for mass killing of cranes in the district of Negativ-Schlagrijn had been carried out.
Critics had called the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with bats particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the creaming, does not bring anything," the city and landscape planner Werner Klövern noted from empty.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr said in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Crowding is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem could not be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer said.
A combination of creams of animals from sensitive residential areas and lock offerings is possible to resettle them to other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens threw "information boards instead of chainsaws" for a completely different handling of the animals: "We can finally bear a spike in the face most confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where he provided information on the life of highly intelligent seeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to get to a treat, but produce their own tools as tools.
Conductors of Cambridge University recently tested four seeds to what extent the intelligence of birds is sufficient.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a frame to fall with stones to reach a mothlarve.
Without much training, they determined which size and shape a stone must have to have in order to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the fiddly crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larve.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then landed the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds were able to do so at the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained unchanged.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Introduced by the twice successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive EM participation perfect after the 0:0.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in play-off play-back with Montenegro outsiders, after the play-back (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
There was no more fire in Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland picked up a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trading meter (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free shot of about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the gate line (33).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the focus.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, Stark decided to go to Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
For the fifth consecutive time, the European Champion of 1976 will go to the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) had also been lucky and had to survive a shock in the early stages.
Finalist Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner through Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had its greatest chance when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penalty line just passing the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross country had to save the Czechs for the already beaten world class tower, again the storm of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football wound.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink is almost certain to have his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even sink the detonator in the gate.
However, after the shock, Croatia was increasingly taking control.
Even after the break, the Croats let nothing burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made the 62nd minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in service.
Trapatnon goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the play, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equals for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unfortunate defense from Sänsmann Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ employees," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is currently expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in Boomland.
China's growth plans are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.

Currently, the software provider's business, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Englund's new book "Beauty and horror. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" begins with a long list of main people who go to heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: carefully cut this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in England’s romantic narrative very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you are lost like England’s men and women in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like". It is about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost combined the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulances and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the candles in one church, some come along while others disappear.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating postwar war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" walks with expert views of other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsfliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floodes the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina smelling like Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"Miscellaneous facts," says Englund, "are furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stump, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or catchy, but they are extremely alive in English of the collection of small moments losing in detail.
Many of them deal with lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replace everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false eraser rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about replacement lunch in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hammock (and lastly served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes covered with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to go wild and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything that was meant for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, and doing so as if such a façade meant civilization and if there was no barbarism behind his own strengthened and plagued shirt chest."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a custom suit that sank while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseeable way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a sexual illness with a prostitute in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonococcal Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Jene, who were really desperate, looked him in the eyes, which led to them being blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "detached uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books on the First World War were usually falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarks "In the West Nothing New" than extensive historical books.
Englunds Band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a material book.
I don't give it back.
But it's as if with his book he had taken this page with the main characters away from the nose and lit with a match.
After an early absence, a carefully planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them wearing helmets.
One had chosen for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else thought they would take part in an exercise at the beginning.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against protesters, which violates the rules of the disarray and gave the housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove protestors from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos education - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who is familiar with the commands said what a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was Zuccotti Park," said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officers wanted to clear the park, but then left when hundreds of protestors came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including deployment commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people in the park was present," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were available before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded news, which hurried from the loudspeakers, seemed to intimidate many protestors.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protestors simply caught up and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m., no tents would be set up to give the protester time to pack up their possessions and good.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene, requiring arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, President of the Police, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists say they wanted to stop them from watching police operations in the park, and they said that the handling of officials was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved west through the big mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the cleaning up of the city, which had been abandoned.
Some protestors who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protestors moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp joined up with their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to the police, the room was closed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, due to "inadequate behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent officer on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway waited between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block southwards.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, as several officials, many of them with signs of protection were observed driving persons outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of guardians will file an action against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last opportunity left to the trade union, District Council 37, in its efforts to withdraw the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid employees and had lost their job in a chess train on 7 October, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund maintained by the working groups last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was rejected by the authorities categorically.
At a city council hearing, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies had been part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that staff would be released from school assistance.
City council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The action will bring Mr. Walcott and the City Ministry of Education as accused and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in front of the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of redundancies in schools in the city’s poor neighbourhoods to support an action for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 helpers were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
By identifying the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a well-known neighborhood of parents who can arrange donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by language in a memo which approved the dismissal of the coordinators of care.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (transmitting German) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six carer coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft action.
Mission terminated, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already in agreement on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations adopted a resolution under the chairmanship of John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "mute".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simply in the Libya debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House fought over the election of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law passed in the Senate. In addition, the board passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was raised enough to criticize Obama's approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him out of the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their liberation" and "loaths the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the foreign relations body or will they split the legislators as the June Act did?
The last version is against the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian police), the top republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote on a constitutional amendment this week calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislative period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or another area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and include a wide range of topics.
Some are doubles - the same law has been presented to both Congress and Senate - others are slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the budgetary change in the Senate alone and another ten that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage to the same sex is also a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws when two thirds of the states reject them.
As eagerly as Members propose changes, they move as unevenly faster than in recent years.
In the 111st Congress, the legislators introduced 77 such changes. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to the early 1990s, where members regularly anticipate more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures made available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Meeted but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man from the nearest distance shot at her during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20", she ranked for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that shared its skull pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to Congress to triumph in giving her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special has been pursuing Gifford's recovery since the assassination on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with bare shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
Nicken with his head.
A tickle with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congressman singing "Free Fallin" together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is subject to medical treatment while he is waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You were just met.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala collecting millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him on a catchword.
The crowd in black tuxedo rose and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The sharp contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public increasingly behaved as if people were suffering in uniform.
"We were by no means a victim," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support him is to push us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger against the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks will take place on compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "wrong, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and took over a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked whether he was able to cope with the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions from it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely normal in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public for the most part focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Forces find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is facing the growing pressure to go through violence
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are charged with non-intervention in the case of rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
Super-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12 Pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have filed against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February submitted by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit at the beginning included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months increased to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an appropriate case law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's pursuing top military leadership because the problem begins there.
"The military is built up hierarchically," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints in order to maintain pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the action.
The files of the court that is present in Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by current or former soldiers of injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed to active soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to the service of the fight, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in war zones.
The result: 150 women soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of whom died in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the alleged promotion of an anti-female atmosphere.
Independent of this, the non-profit Vietnam veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personal disorder" that victims of rape received to release them from service - a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, their group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) in which they accused their discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
New laws were presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offer a number of points of reference.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defense, 3.158 sexual abuse was reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: 20 per cent of cases in the military were brought to trial in 2010, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, who was cut from his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during this hearing she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the attack.
Six persons spoke out as witnesses of character in the name of the alleged offender, who was finally released.
"I remember the day the verdict was read well," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would be used. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I got out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was disloyald, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit, which Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, progresses, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he remarked, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am a contemporary critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that brings with them liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them that they try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch On Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent her anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having conducted an amok run in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on the sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the UK Ideas Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the site to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking themselves to a new band or diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitude to violence, and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's quite a new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of extreme right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in scientists' hands.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to societal trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this site in title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page, which you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access," Bartlett says.
"With Facebook it all falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-blown noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drown than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-ranking students, such as residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, participation in the intermediate elections in 2010 and a National Happiness Index (mainly using data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have known for a long time that the site should make its large data base for others available for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site allows you to collect your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think that many users at all have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social life - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Calt and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who made two amoks, in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo as a "resistance fighter".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hissideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who made a pre-written speech, to address his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that Breivik police remain in custody for 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and all correspondence closely over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted the confirmation that he was behind lock and bars.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything went out of the way.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," one survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen the suspect and heard."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the entire hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there would be no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may agree that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not the work of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said the victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs that was shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting technology genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently discovered job interview, which was released this week before special screenings on important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acquittal organizer who was eager to build diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors were suffering from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialists" on the rise of the personal computer. And he sat for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, after 10 years, jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing from the delivery.
It was only after jobs died that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be released on Wednesday and Thursday at the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is known to hate extensive interviews, jobs appear here surprisingly eagerly in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when it seems to be impatient to respond to Cryingely's questions and pushes him to respond faster to topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow eeriely broad when jobs assess what other companies are doing right or wrong in their opinion and his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous ratings of career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the move to grandeur is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all these years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished how costs were recorded - most of the time they started with "standard" costs, which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent possible.
How the Pope was aged:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when it describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-based phone, make a call and then connect from one AT&T network to another, as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you grow into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says giggling jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continue to tell of a glorious string that Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called through Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were as good as Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh out before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever created".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some of the records, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... you screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
About large companies leaving behind:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs predicted the ways in which so many industrial giants had taken pride in their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, Na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it is such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
You caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
After all, it goes out to taste, it goes out to try to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then try to put these things together into what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who are by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws when court adopts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically-dividing question of whether to listen to President Obama's health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was passed by Congress last year, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be dropped, will probably be Paul Clement, once the Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of almost two dozen companies supporting the annual dinner of federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmacigent Pfizer Inc., which is highly financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had advised on the case.
One of the services was Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events nearer to the law and other organizations, while the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or according to the program no guest of such an event."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it were sufficient to alarm moral and government activists.
"This amazing breach of morality and the contrast to the Code penalizes the actions of some judges against lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal courts," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined in court during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings."
Their appearance and support for a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix justice too easily with groups that can be led from the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney under the Obama administration when the first legal proceedings were brought before the court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any plans to do this.
Boeing draws record of 18 trillion dollars on land
Airlines Emirates is ordering 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with one option on another 20 aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth over $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order for more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft overall is at a record total of $18 trillion.
Similarly unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its biggest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual-range Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer order came from the company Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced that Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option on the purchase of 20 more aircraft, which allows the total list price to rise to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is over $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the lead with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed, which will compete directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race around the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor's office in the western state from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the entire election process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... They occupied election cabins, built road blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI reigned seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only barely beaten Claderon, who had conducted the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the governor who is still in office, came to third place, a serious defeat for the split and unsuccessful left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left for fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how evil the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who probably represents the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look brave next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone
Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will curb the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that they were looking "unacceptably" at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support from the European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been experiencing a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers both of Italy and of Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to come together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, have no reason to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less live a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly run, loss-taking facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of ADBs with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the year 2011/ now threatens "the risk of degradation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crime plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital drain of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in the defense system
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unobtrusively, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian fleets.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but is now afraid that further reductions of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot complete its spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such an unintentional way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"In addition, we would be forced to separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff involuntaryly, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to leave civilians on a marginal basis in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alertness."
The cuts were finally made to meet the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the counter-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime traders and disrupted both legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and there is certainly none that we should be urged to do so."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the Senators' new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will reinforce demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has pronounced the possible cuts unobtrusively, although he could gather many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a gloomy picture of what could be imminent - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accommodate it with potential opponents."
"She makes one really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta commented on new details on how reductions "reduce significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global ability to use and absorb, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could be the victim of the removal, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
The list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step towards upgrading, so that possible dangers can be eliminated by China and other opponents.
How to detangle a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the accusations of sexual harassment by several women.
Penn State's leadership is accused of misdemeanour, as it is alleged that reports of a retired football coach having sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he put into circulation denials, which were quickly denied by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in campaign financing related to the embezzlement of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, nobody who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to the Oval Office during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about foaming in school and at college are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they could do well in their performance checks themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and foams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or "discovering lies" is one important thing to learn for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Scharaden, in which it is the goal to call "Hab yourself!", detaching a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths have been exposed to the lie.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stutter, rot and do not always beat.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to reveal and detangle.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questions and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of detachment. And it is clear that detaching a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially if the hiring or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to one's own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people's interests and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men notice more "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies "focus more on others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person as an evildoer has been disguised, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the smile, the voice quality of your test person.
You should know better when someone usually keeps tripping with the foot, so that they do not wrongly accuse him if he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Look at these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of a detachment.
People who are mistaken may become stronger when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet are pointing towards the door or they are leaning towards the exit, changing their position significantly or showing a "distress after the attitude interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that a recruitment interview is over, just to look after this relaxation after the recruitment interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's runner is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a dissipating language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... according to the best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to shirk.
There is no magic to detach lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to detach.
Thanks to these abilities, anyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan is reviewed after risk by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of Canada's planned oil pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, annoying trade unions while calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to replan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This was achieved following a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogalla aquifer, a large underwater supply, was reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written declaration that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico in Canada.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, consider the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogalla aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy stated that the ministry's chief auditor requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company entrusted with conducting the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she allegedly forced a baby for fear of vomiting
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a tumultuous attack that would have scared her little daughter so much that she passed away for fear.
The Tirade of the Lady Marmalade made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family in front of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the 10th of November last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve decided to take a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby with his luggage and Genevieve on his arm in her building on the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle enraged the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to bark - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to chicken water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her company and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The action is for a non-specific compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and the family would plan to spend the money they will receive to help children with cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to assume responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is laid on the face of a kindergarten teacher who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate Checks Stop the Economy
In the first year, in which Mario López is Valdez at the government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and had great hopes about economic growth, is government. However, due to the climatic imbalances, growth cannot be the cause of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% in the first quarter.This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a negative impact on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March there were 55,053 people in Sinaloas without employment, which represents 4.53% of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19 percent, which results in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa this year is based on several factors: the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing at the moment is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market as a result of cuts in the funds by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who are under ban to let them work for themselves, to invest them or to use something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, due on the one hand to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there as well. These people remain here looking for work, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when considering the high proportion of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 per cent of those employed in the country who work without paying into social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest in the whole of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government of Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, 2011 shows the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years. According to the Secretary of Economic Affairs (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretary of Economic Development, Económico del Gobierno, for its part, recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 Pesos at the National Congress in July to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 Pesos, but until November no positive effects of the debt could be identified on any of the sectors in the country.
Reactions
Mario López Valdé's first year of government revealed his inability to govern the entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to make double efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, such as the Frost at the beginning of the year, slowed and slowed down the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy, which is not sufficiently in motion to create an economic dynamic that could produce a acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefining the appointment
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that the state had to be encouraged to become more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will lead the government's efforts in a better way.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where we can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison because of the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecution of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010M-I, on 7 June 2010, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street over guard post No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person remains in the place of execution.
Debt for construction work
The social constructions for migrants provided for in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds available to them, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us any money, and even though they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take up a 7 million loan at the beginning of its term of government, corresponding to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient financial resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to acquire the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a pen."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in recent years in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional charges filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree and, by means of which the switch-over of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, had to be postponed due to the lack of eight votes required for the legislative challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree on the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes to enable the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the proposal for the action, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree of Law unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Committee on Federal Telecommunications (Cofetel), which is why the Decree of Law would be contrary to hierarchical principles and to the rule of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree. After the claims had been accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer used the decree and introduced all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the motion tabled by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if we did that, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because they lead the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "for it embraces economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "needed to act throughout the system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics which lay the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, and even though they had highly specialised institutions, had already done so.
It cannot be concluded that the government, by issuing the contested decree of law, enters into the competence of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074.
The possibility of the individual counting of ballots is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data published by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminaries (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the Governor's elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the Electoral Office had adopted a series of rules to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted its political constitution, electoral law or law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Advertiser within the time limits set out for this purpose with the argument or objection to have.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "decision or veto against it".
In an interview on the possibility of the individual counting of votes, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the ballot.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on counting and calculating votes do not appear by act or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
Furthermore, if there is a difference between the alleged winner and that who is in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of complete ballots may be counted, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request by the party/coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The vote may also be counted in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages that were subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés hurried down on this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant-in-chief was that his ashes would be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others, returned to the capital of Coahula by plane from the Mexican Air Force during the accident. The next-most of the people took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, at noon, the Lieutenant Colonel's ashes landed at the grief hall, located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical abiturage and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the abiturage.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From their point of view, the Lieutenant-Chancellor had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even drowsy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven, he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: a plane fly.
Last Farewell
The chief lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honoured with all honours under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honours were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, school principals and students of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and found himself excellent both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons were sitting from the same authority, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the front yard of the barracks of the funeral company. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were expecting him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different body parts and a shot of grace in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometer point 1.5 on the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passing passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up in a barren way.
When they looked into the house, they found inside the bodies of three persons, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to it was another one dressed with a white top.
Just a metre away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another location, as no cartridge shells were found.
On the wall of the country house are read inscriptions written by one organized criminal gang to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of Defense Nacional introduced 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal activity primarily in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, on November 11th eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and one cell phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
At 06.00 a.m. on November 12, the military found a car with two occupants in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, which tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret executions in the places General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Wednesday Education of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow in order to introduce the new government, which is supposed to offer its forehead to the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow in order to introduce the new government, which is supposed to offer its forehead to the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm government formation.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of Technocrats cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation to the President.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "Framework is now well set", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven debt costs to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard savings package, which was called for by the Euro-politicians to regain their confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was reinforced by the fluctuating market situation, which led to the tax on Italian government bonds for 10 years with 7 percent interest rates, which is the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this crisis.
The chances of success for Monti were considerably increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday following the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a majority of Technocrats-based government that is currently forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks is also under pressure, pointing out that a Montis failure is a disaster.
Monti started discussions with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as with youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The meeting is scheduled to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath of breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has once again reached critical limits for Italian government bonds.
A rescue in Italy with a state debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predicting that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefer the elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by pressure on financial markets.
Political sources point to the complexity of mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties in involving people from political life.
Spanish have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten more than 50 international games are on the go.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called up 50 games is behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game that takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While the world champions and Europeans, the number one number on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back at a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complicated playoffs at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
On the other hand, the Tico football players have few international meetings in the Concaf, which is at the very bottom of the FIFA range.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (lower 0-1 in London) reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will record a new record of 127 games abroad.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona Football Club player, has 106.
Last week Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the mid-storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games came in over 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games are available in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national team side, there are fewer than 30 Roy Miller games with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20's border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic Spanish goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet moved Costa Rica to his tour to celebrate its twenty-year anniversary
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts the next Sunday in the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica, starting at 7.30 p.m.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that can be realized for us too.
This is the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you because the fans of the band are completely dedicated. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We've spent almost 21 years coming to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have needed so long until we're here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't this a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've spent the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have experienced about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You will never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so the decision we will each play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have no longer played in the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and surprise them because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
Looking back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us has imagined playing in a great rock band once, even for over 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited about producing music.
We're lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
A band comes out of a city every now and then, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with all of them and we honor being part of this rising Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together for so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being happy and also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better for us.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted to do thanks to your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall down this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of the music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without having to be a famous rock star. We have never been interested in that.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We’re still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see pictures, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That’s certainly exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he does.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
Among the first to come to my attention are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a modesty?
I think we all do not feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time, come to mind. If they are still important today, I think it's great because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
In the beginning her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light-hearted, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed playing them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - it clearly affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years of imprisonment for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body groups.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated on four times on tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition to other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Speciales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suits itself for the exchange of information on all policies between the two countries", announced the South American country's presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support for Calderón with regard to the incident with France, when the French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries which are still tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a question to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries in the world. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements to exchange tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all the international standards for tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snowy installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser's claws, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he struggles for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the store counters all over the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the portable console Ninety 3DS, which can be played without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Nintendo press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because so far, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" on the different game legs, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The snowy installer must overcome with dangers pickled platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States to answer for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
For example, the trial on the U.S. request for extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his government he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests from which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which preceded extradition, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinidad has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinyovove social welfare organisation have produced important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group are added.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event at the former Fabra i Coats factory building, attended by more than 300 people, was held yesterday.
Trinijove was created in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education without work with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
During yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous officials from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during the election period demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinyovo.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinyovove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The houseowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building last afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they had illegally occupied and organized in which they had organised huge festivals that had driven the neighbourhood to despair. The room was held on a court order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house administrator confirmed.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to the European Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the beginning of her home occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made her unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Moreover, the owner of the leisure space had been shown by the neighbors because of disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the housekeepers and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became more and more and more in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque stated that the harassment had been so great that it coincided with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she has received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular Party) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to clear the building immediately and get to grips with the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the coming down of the district.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that in recent months the housekeepers had been preoccupied on all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some it had even come to theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and tackle the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban invitation to tender for the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its treatise on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became again the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but to the top (mountain) and bottom (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role of the yogi bear was now no longer the model of Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars.
So far, when the city was issued in September, a giant invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, was issued for further access gates to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning on putting gates on the ground.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recent theme that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can draw on.
And precisely this fact offers the material for one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast about the "Front on the mountain" as far as the discourse of Ildefon's Cerda, which has been carried out over the green apples, has not been carried out.
"You should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": "You must not imagine it as an access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, regards the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that holds "some dangers".
Threats arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today" following the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is that it will be its own limitation on what can be built.
"Something to limit always means to set the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says that the side of Collserola, going towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "hit on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for having given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment on".
He also points out that the proximity of the mountain range to the city of the letter of instruction allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he points out his "crime" to whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("just the right thing", he says) that "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola fails: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This has at least led to his taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip is directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released, after the Casino Red's agent has given him to the Second Criminal Court of the District, which conducts the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money to allow the City Administration to accept the secret operation of the bet house.
After the criminal prosecution, the prosecution opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Paniste Mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Heritagees, he was taken to Casa de Arrigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta's detention centre because he allegedly stole the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the middle security tract, as threats of murder against him existed.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Prison.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, sent him an arrest warrant, which found that after nearly two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to talk to Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
On Monday, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Casino Red's representative to impose the penalty on Judge José Luis Pecina, the Mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, who was assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had fixed the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had declared their forgiveness. However, the lawyer held back the name.
According to case 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also, the following cannot be filed against the proceedings, nor is there any compensation required.
After hearing the representative of the bet house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
Judge Jorge Yánez drove to San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to let Jonás know that he had been released and that his case would be referred to the files.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretary of Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, indicate that the helicopter, with its entire uninjured structure, had hit the ground directly, without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, where the helicopter lost the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why he met all the requirements for the transportation of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found at other locations, which involved the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a deviation of between 7 and 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but these could take several months, perhaps even one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, Mexico, assured the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial during the flight speed attack and the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the impact it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, identified six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the sight flight. This means that the crew would have had sufficient vision during the flight and at the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the follow-up flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep clouds emerged.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. No loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route may have occurred before the impact.
Distribution of the aircraft's remains in a limited area:
The information available up to the present time indicates that the helicopter was blown in straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was blown up on the ground with its unharmed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The aircraft's remains offer neither fire nor explosion at the site of the accident.
The latest survey results indicate several soil contacts.
In the on-site tests aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abysmal and has a shear of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter might have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had struck the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
The social insurance institution of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in association with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Medical Research Department, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Esspecialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the IMSS sports facilities in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday tests with children and young people are carried out from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of México) and continued since 8 October at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México).
If the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independentencia (in the south of the capital district) and be completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the objective of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and adolescents.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it was hoped that three thousand children and adolescents aged between six and 14 should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He further stated that on the said Saturdays, subjects would be measured (weight, size, waist size), blood pressure controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (invitation of genes related to obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the context of the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys showed that in almost six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight was also dramatically increased," stressed IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He indicated that a Mexican (e) was an average of 65% Indian-American, 30% European, and 5% African, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity express itself in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive study of children who would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and told the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to the parents and propose changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there would be three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.), together with a high intake of fat and protein, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents blow holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM, developed asphalts modified with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs drawn from the road surface were taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 holes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface would be adequate, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his talk "technically-based impact holes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with an extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that asphalt - the most heavy part of the oil - is a hydrocarbons compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called maltene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic toughelastic behavior.
The teeth-elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C it is almost firm, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ's researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road surface, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lie a wear layer made of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then fortified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better," the chemical engineer said.
"Over the wear layer", he explained, "is designed a final layer, the so-called bearing layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
The majority of the forces of this road surface are received and distributed, the bearing layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain is moistened, water penetrates into the layer and only occurs difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of impact holes.
When a impact hole is created," he said, "the cover layer is first worn down, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained for the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores ( Mexico's national research system) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that in order to avoid frequent impact holes this regulation is complied with.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many more research had to be carried out, for example via asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, which allowed the impact holes to be repaired easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors affecting the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, show a silver crown and the band she shows as a new Miss Colombia.
With this night’s result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Department has already received 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. The declared misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing, she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, a title that also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of the Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint them as first misrepresentation is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has most affected you and why?", which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that was the most powerful for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a very deep book.
Currently I am reading `Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading just a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called `disciples'.
A response that came to little love, firstly because of the notion of 'civilizing' and secondly because she had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people, read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had received all the applause and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, Public Opinion on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other women candidates had jealously made what the queen stressed, which is why she couldn't shine on stage."
And they noticed this during their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned a misdemeanor "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become a queen."
In addition, Valle left the way to the end of the press - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noted in the stomach. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which I honestly couldn't notice, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos considered that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them do the right thing.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the show in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was blasphemed that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to allow them to enjoy the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that from today on Melina will start her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on the National Beauty Competition in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will go into history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a Lophoscope of the Investigation Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a standby service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of deployment against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliaszar was told to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was expecting him.
He flew from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located by means of the investigation, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, for this was not least similar to the illustrations he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant shell and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it correctly: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Find Tracks
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the assessment given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without a rate of error that can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopes not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery, and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identity papers or they have none.
We take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house when he was stealing a thief, because the thief had just stood up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for the loss of fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the full print and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by snuff bottles.
In the investigation it was assumed that a family member might be suspected, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dictyloscope said that "the fingerprints would be removed from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
If they appear, a plant shell or a tape will be used to take it.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Personal Status Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," the CTI expert explained.
He said not everything was as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold, which shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "empires" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of it came after the smoke command and changed its location to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called on New York authorities to re-enter the Manhatten Square with a court order after they had been removed from the square in dawn and tried to occupy another square on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "empires" to return to this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on to the command of the fugitive and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests took place.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "empires" to the enslavement of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent enslavement of the square and authorising the protesters to the tent.
In addition, the "Empires" occupied a new park located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entry into the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured the News Agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have found themselves at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti square (a private property site) is closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday and will analyse the legality of the room in the morning grey.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed it. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the square, which had resulted in "some minor collisions", as Bray reported, who had shown some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "Acts passed after the occupation and prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things that they had already used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that due to this judicial order the reopening of the square for public transport and the protesters had been lifted. The protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the Zuccotti Square, which was held in the morning gray, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "wrong the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to smoke the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some business would have received threats" and the residents were "fearing for their quality of life".
"The nightmare in dawn was disgusting and shows Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The officials of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already taken since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities she will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary during a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson and the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" on December 1 and will breathe a very special Virgin Mary's life.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears on the Internet for the distribution of a self-spinned porn, in which she, together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as Virgin Mary with a doll in the chair to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peter's, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a presenter in Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show, appears as Jesus' child.
CTV's Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peter's, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had called North American Kim Kardashian "Hore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still recovering from the devastating earthquake leading to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the high-rated ratio for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery may be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of incessant increases.
Nevertheless, the real recovery of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is upwelled by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "portunities" of investors fleeing from the euro zone debt crisis and the bleak forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that, like a gravestone, cost the export companies' accounts.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony traced their weak business results from July to September to the Yen rating.
While markets continue to siege the peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government remains vigilant.
"It is necessary to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exhilarating.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states in September had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator, which assumes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the greatest economic potential would have slowed down.
For he fell by four tenths to a lot of 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement.
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and the widespread uncertainty, Greece is further mistaken in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days that were scheduled for his appointment were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and in no case withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion, disciplinary law reform programmes for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not cast doubt on his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The Conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with the Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be alarmed: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties "not signed a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors were "very soon" coming back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what to pay for the sixth section" of €8,000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing.
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that in the last two decades, Spain has become the second donor to this international cooperation instrument worldwide. Her "Wesen" rests on the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in people.
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "margin of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world, and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken from the summit that will last until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We've had many successes" and "we've faced many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for launching "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that she would strive for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would go beyond the poverty line.
The conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world dates back to the path "initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as an "admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the lending strategy on the ground.
One year later, this experience was followed by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At all, "we can observe continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday gave her the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "promote of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by stimulating those present to participate in the debate and seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to tie development aid to times of economic booms, since it was a “long-term obligation”.
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialised countries would now have to work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained "of the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "heavy" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes that the EU President be elected on the basis of a general vote.
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but was put in place in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those who consider the government policy of the Greeks to be too lax in the future, and possibly in Italy.
The Presidency's proposal for a European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine votes against, ten had abstained.
The several-minute standing ovation, which was initially known as Angela Merkel and, several hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, was not open to any doubt by the three finance ministers in Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the petitions, is the following slogan: "the answer to the crisis is not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a revision of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but could also lead to a change in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" to give a face to Europe".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone is laid, however.
Likewise, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country on the Executive Board, in line with the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The chancellor's concern for calming the climate within her party has therefore reinforced the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or difficult European countries that would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the significance of the "French-German friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France on the agenda.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of medical reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now attacking the medical reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family support fund and talk about the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on an attempt to test the economy, but on the other hand is no less a pretext for an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on employee health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth-day period before taking into account a health report for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the pay of four days without the specific company's approval, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to raise anger, would help to bring EUR 280 million.
And the more symbolic character of another measure would be to grant the public officials an unpaid card day in case of illness (to date, unlike the three card days in the private sector, there is no card period).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also re-produces the subject of fraud, this time aiming at the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, these must be refunded if this is required," said Xavier Betrand on Sunday November 13th, in front of the radio microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of medical reports seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 and of political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stick to the country-wide figures.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily deposits were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the daily deposits in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion of health expenditure.
Of these, 46% fell in the case of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% in the case of sick leave, which is worth EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that covers certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40.000 surveyed, said that French workers did not have a single day of illness.
Another study, this time recorded by the health insurance, makes clear that 37% of sick reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
So, compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be incapacity for work more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall rate of absenteeism (based on disease or other grounds) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of health reports, fraud is a disparately small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only a small amount of fraud.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systemic checks on sick reports that go beyond 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (Public College of Technicians and Engineers' Training) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 completed short-term medical reports, called in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
Among the systematically controlled cases of illness of more than 45 days duration, there were fewer than 1.2 million cases of 11% "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
All in all, this makes 169,000 "unwarranted" cases to several million workers who have submitted a health claim.
A point which represents only a weak balance over, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a substantive report on this issue published in July, this represents a tax loss of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to absorb its economy.
On Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union did not suffice to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public address at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the Eurozone was "at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's state deficit by 9% of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the measures already approved as regards an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent it in advance that his party would not be ready for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of Members of his Party New Democracy.
He had expressed his willingness to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, an EU Commissioner with responsibility for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, said Antonio Samaras had responded that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and associated free death must be legalised, such as an expert panel
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report by the Royal Society of Canada.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together in the area of pain relief to provide the best pain relief tools, and beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, who are interlinked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this election takes place, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of them finally die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is the highest in Quebec with 86% of deaths in the hospital.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already taken on board, not wishing to make any amendments to the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach to euthanasia and accompanied suicide has legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to the use of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canada’s Support for Euthanasia
Let us consider that according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already benefited from euthanasia, as they feel that these people would at the end of their lives make it possible to alleviate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not lead to the message that the life of elderly or disabled people is of less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practised an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as patient maintenance or discontinuation of resources is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the report's author.
Similarly, they suggest in their recommended list that the criminal law should specify that the removal of the means for which a valid rejection has been made should not be considered criminal.
The Expert Panel also calls for health care professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the removal of resources at the end of their lives, without having to fear criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief to provide the best pain relief remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Last but not least, the panel calls for at least consideration of pain relief or life-saving measures already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, as they did not serve as much as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and to address it with the same procedures.
Subject matter of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Canadian Society.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, referred to the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme" among other things, since it does not limit the practice of euthanasia in the case of patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age is asking another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility for all the other values involved in the social activity of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, Health Law Specialist, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-Euthanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the non-prevention of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a "complott"
Syria is now more isolated
The Partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, however, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "complot" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the Prime Minister of Jordan, who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to establish his power in Syria, in which the forty civilians and members of the government had already been killed.
"Put Bashar at heart the interest of his country, so he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that Turkish mediation efforts aimed at the Syrian regime had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"Those in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, must go," he said, pointing out to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is constantly taking a harsh attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "agreeding of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In the face of repression in Syria, the international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have made an ever sharper sound," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region of southern Syria died, as announced by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two more civilians, according to this NGO, had died in the besieged town of Homs, in "Shootings and Heavy Bombs around Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Trade, Walid al-Muallim, nevertheless felt that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
He has, by the way, strongly responded to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which, in his opinion, represents a "dangerous step".
Syria"will not give up", he added under the pressure, "the complotts forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "Civil Protection Mechanism" and wishes to deploy 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Trade Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to protect civilians from repression by encapsulating themselves after him into his "Paranoia".
An extraordinary re-meeting of the League is scheduled for Rabat tomorrow in order to discuss the implementation of the plan to increase the crisis, adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities as well as the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow described the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrected" in order to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has taken a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, in turn, been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday in order to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that "the markets will prove to be patient and discreet".
Its appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets, but the turmoil had increased further, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial output in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister is to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new government was only supposed to be the date of the next parliamentary elections by 2013, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government was to receive Parliament's certificate of confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti, since taking up his role, has undertaken to work urgently in order to make Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change, even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which believes that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new measures of austerity.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italian Chief Executive Officer, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, is also concerned with the need to boost the economy" because a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit indicators".
Mr Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoque Change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "request of confidence" and "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown was the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-emptive elections, as from April 2012, Italy will have to pay 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable explosive capsule, so confirmed an American NGO specialised in nuclear risks on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the explosion-generated production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev producing "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who had not only been involved in this technology but also, as a member of the Agency said, had worked throughout his career on this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or have increased slightly over the same period.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, thus by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes had been recorded globally.
The total number of hate-motivated crimes had risen to 6.628 cases in very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communication.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, an official of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards the "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin colour, religion or descent, and now also involving sexual offences.
Twitter is changing the platform and is becoming more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "name" make it easier to readable live follow-up of the activities of other "twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This enables us to find out whether they allow us to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, whether they prefer certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August with a small percentage of users", said Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with slightly esotheric-like text (RT to refer to repeating another person's contribution). follow Friday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiative happy, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users discussed this innovation via Internet using certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and very similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me to track certain elements of my Flux twitter better," declared @dannykron current.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the Great Socialist/Christian-Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top bonus (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay hadn't fallen to AA+ at once, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria also meets a demand from the Brussels Eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would have called for the introduction of a reduction in public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or through the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP limit, whereas the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt in the horizon of 2020/21 below the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again on the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility in the yen's exchange rate", we will intervene as we did the last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was set close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to lower the Japanese currency value, which is in the process of controlling a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has steadily increased over it, baptized by purchases of investors who view the yen as "a safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has drifted under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash of Japanese currency is damaging to the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which have devastated the Tohoku region (northeast),," stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this price increase of the yen could already kill the weak upswing in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the leaping export growth and the consumption of the "marked" households again on the force of the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the yen's price does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to cancel the yen.
However, Mr. Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed the House that the BoJ has already launched "appropriate measures", which he said would make it clear that no further currency relaxation is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to clear the 55,000 yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest ratefts fast up to the level, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis constantly undermines European indicators.
Despite the take-up of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are constantly increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are also operating a little more in negative terms on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% and dropped to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding government bond yields in the difficult euro area, global stock markets continue to spend some of their recent profits.
"Capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe, that the debt crisis continued, had closed with a decrease of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited corridor of variation, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, Fund Manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging to the single currency, which will continue on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dolls, so it was 0.4% lower.
According to the stock exchange brokers, after the CDU, the chancellor Angela Merkel's party, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request which provided in particular for the possibility for countries in difficulty to exit the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's interest on loans remains very worrying.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent to 10 years, the one of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investors' fears.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets in order to restore the situation threatened by indebtedness in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expected growth rates in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded a 0.4% household-based economic growth in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the second quarter figures, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbing to economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first set-aside of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to hold an election to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing for a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is planning to build only nuclear power stations of the last generation.
By contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to join another unit in its park by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence on imported gas, especially from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European table leader in wind energy, from which it refers to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% respectively higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
Since energy prices in the globalised economy are a key factor in competitiveness and a stability path for industry on the national level, French companies have an advantage due to the best electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us note that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a wealth of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, most of these SMEs would be victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would be reduced more and more.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed for operation over sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is just as little a miracle to the production of electricity as a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromised and transparent controls in existing plants, such as at the construction site in Flamanville.
Their teams, who have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just possessed by the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, entered under normal operating conditions; so it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous accidents.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that allows it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electric technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a number-based policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students on the part of the public authorities had marked the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talent, masonry or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right the sound of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900.000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not absorb the whole poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of large-scale mobility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 both from the right and from the left.
The two camps saw immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity to which immigrants are allowed.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines itself to banalities which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recently published book that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Reducing immigration would undermine growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workforce, in particular the low skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than local wage earners, since they are mainly employed in sectors which are unladen in the workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage earners do not travel much, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, so this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigration on wages and national labour market situations between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is acceptable (how much immigrant immigrants are among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person moving to Germany at the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime on average.
At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth".
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over the entire 20th century on the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supremes in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct possible way, to see democracy overcome once and for all over its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the Little One" that it was a characteristic of the attitude of the mind.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this, and can become just as well an instrument of repression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, and jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
In this respect, the change of mind of the Greek true-false referendum would have had a double-denominated character: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impotence, their impatience.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to press for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in accordance with the needs and in a wrong order.
A free pass for the European single ruler or a leap with connected eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacker beil, but a collective task, of full law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is the case in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies that suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations that join it.
The urgency lies in giving the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
It is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and create a future by investing.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely ruining us.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought over for a long time, everyone today is pushing for European economic governance.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to citizens - this would be a renewed folly and another dead end.
We need to take a new stage in European integration.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must create a more integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" Chip cards become the general good
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared with the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and to represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments after a long period of time in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept this.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visas have been distributed.
The consumer markets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million non-contact MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have undertaken to systematically hand over their customers bank cards with a contactless chip in the future," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC technology needed to carry out these transactions (Near Field Communication) has so far been equipped with a very low percentage of devices.
"They're in default."
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the launch of an offer that would enable its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-awaited relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Secretary of State Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now gained "certainty".
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations of the secret services point to clear cooperation," he explained without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigations into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have encouraged interfaces to take place on a day-to-day basis.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, were to have been killed on the following day, at the same time as several of their kidnappers, on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the debris at the site of operation that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several interview partners located in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: One number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stopped the cradle of Boko Haram; the other number leads to a man who is considered close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is, however, conceivable".
"For years, it has been known that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
Over the past few months, these "support services" have become more and more visible in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and operating modes, which now point to the addition of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the grouping to be a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haousa means as much as "western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It Politizes and claims strict respect for the Sharia, while its affiliated activists are fighting against the godless central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s response is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, with 800 dead.
The detained Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was assigned the blame of a suicide bombing that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be the top international destination.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since been a source of concern to all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and expressed his willingness to provide all the information".
The world in the eyes of the Republican presidential candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-impaired America be a complex world with simple ones, not to say, lead to simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly made their giving statements and statements on foreign policy, which is a traditional Republican focus.
China, Iran, and Israel's aid often fall - often unsubstantiated - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", the highest-ranking Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of the "money manipulation" - a leading topic in an America that is very much attracted by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid thing, if this is supposed to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost aired himself on his emotions of flattering gestures.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not questioned as he stagnates in the depth of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm commanding Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel enhanced military assistance and accused Obama of being guilty to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-ranking candidate, has a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
Recently, he called for China's military threat to be countered, as Beijing's "trying to develop a nuclear power" seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is willing to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama banned the use of torture in 2009 against alleged terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political weight.
Against the current presidential opponents, Reagan had also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite it all.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine, which concerned the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dispute with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his 'boys' from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
However, this enemy is not quite so unenforced.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has shut down.
Since Iraq, it has been taking care of military interventions that lead to absconding.
And Obama surprised more appropriately by arguing that America needed to be rebuilt economically in order to resurrect its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level last Tuesday under orchestral sound and fine-tasting buffet.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte symbolically turned the tax of the valve that transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe by a first 1.224 km of pipeline connecting the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: for them, it is becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Sowietian pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a confirmation of European energy, as the project has broken the gap between Western and Eastern Europe.
Russia has in barely five years completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are tending.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous gasprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship's anchors.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
Minefields dating from the Second World War had to be removed during their construction.
"Some hundred mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which has been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers have distanced themselves from it, as Sweden was reluctant to see a Russian state society permanently on its coasts.
"In the case of a havary, we close the gas throughput in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
This case, however, is considered unlikely by the designers, as the swathes were estimated to be stable by one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot controlled for external observation from a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, half a meter in diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the smallest repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in Gazprom's hands, holding 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are included (percentage 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (percent 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport company, on the basis of a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transport gas quantity fails," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of the gas transmission system was secured 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline shows up on a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4,5 meter-high valves form the gas outlet spout.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a book of trademarks.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight with writing spent hours.
The notebook by Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell colored sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a separate design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert advisor to the company, is commissioned to market the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfskin), which is a cotton bag used, for example, for covering up cushioned benches.
This type of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artist," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Sales increased by 26% between 2006 and 2010, with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, ranging from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals like Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers, and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and his new writing needs, which despite the upswing of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer envelopes... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that Enthusiasts: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today is now Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled people remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled begins".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is always twice the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, is emphasising the "week of work for the disabled".
"Progress achieved within 15 years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a degree and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria which make it difficult to get back to work and which form the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much for the physical brakes.
Stay the unspeakable, the mental attitudes, which certainly, but slowly evolve.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers interviewed had "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which was "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged persons".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled people, which was enshrined in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now in the middle of 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, who is responsible for attracting contributions from companies that fail to comply with this law.
The proof: The number of "payable" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real understanding, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employed persons with disabilities between 20 and 49 employees, whereas enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Even before they offered the blues Tuesday evenings (20:45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not dedicated their pleasures, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well and gladly make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had won nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures himself.
As regards the contrast between his representation in club and nationallf"It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "gloss".
However, without neglecting the note of "fun".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7; he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the " unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be present", he points out.
"We just walked across the way."
"To be allowed to play means great luck!"
Leekens, on his part, had "stood" with kindness.
"The pride of performing a gala match."
"Stunning" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France"re-emphasized a team at a very high level" and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a fucking good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees the aircraft sharing with the Blues (the French national team) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games". The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams had failed to play the game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to put aside an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the playdown (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to push the key stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not reached an exit gate."
At home, however, in its brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass through in front of an audience who should be just as hot on the game, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very scarce", the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento said.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced to win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz related.
The decision taken on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already be taken by the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is some risk, because we have not reached an exit gate," Bento regrets.
"We're going to fight a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
