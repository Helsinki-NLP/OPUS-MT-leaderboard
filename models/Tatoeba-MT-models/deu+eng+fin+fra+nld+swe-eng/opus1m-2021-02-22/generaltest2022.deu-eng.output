The goods have cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods ....
I'm #PRS_ORG# great and so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be supposed to play a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in measure.
Take a look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 works alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can determine for yourself whether it suits your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him while sleeping for hours.
It is probably questionable by law.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to see the title everywhere, maybe someone knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by overcasting himself with food and going into the mouth of his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapists, runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who before each suicide is assigned anonymously to go and document the site of the suicide and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is implanted a chip that suppresses a fear centre in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way in their fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window another one drives with intent to die)
The book calls this fear "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to deal with a fire.
This is the gross act I am pretty sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this act is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to take?
Is it also possible to get back the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, splitter under the thumb
Child, four years old, has wood chips under the thumb (outside).
Trying to pull him with a pint.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
The combination of digital decoder and sound module on a PCB enables us to achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and thus can be installed in almost any loop of the H0 and 0 track gauges.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm sugar cube speaker along with a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
He manages the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders report to a suitable digital center fully automatically.
It dominates all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track.
For central offices that only the CVs of 1-255 can program exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at mfx® compatible power stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC-spinning automatic allows automatic suspension between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC channels.

Because Omikron: Johnson wants to push up the re-vaccination
Always new cases of Omikron concern politics and science in the UK.
All qualified adults in England are therefore expected to receive a vaccination offer until New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona re-vaccinations due to rapidly rising Omicron numbers than has been the case so far.
Each adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omikron variant, we face an emergency, which is why there is an urgent need to strengthen vaccine protection, said Johnson.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased with a third dose.
"Let's get mad!" said Johnson.
On Sunday 1239 additional Omikron traps were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price if collected?
I'm in favour of everyone imagining themselves with pronouns
I've released an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I've been playing him, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today won't go
Obviously, the chair had an obvious lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only trying on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since around here.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something detailed here about domestic violence.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact for professional reasons more often with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One topic that really is nagging to me and unfortunately far too often happens is that many victims are not allowed to help or think we could not help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond the range of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to all, in part itself is very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so unthinkable.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the "League of Legends" series like?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was leaving.
Again nothing: For the second time in not even three months the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Prior to the game Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October with a look back at the Cup defeat: "We still have some anger in the belly".
But after the game it did not lie down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
More than the naked result disappointed the way the performance took place.
A statistic is called which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-year-old ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) at say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained."
That's to move the ball.
His opposite reaction to Sebastian Gleim was: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were admitted on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and reach up to eight points after they had already left 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time remains to be spent in Hadering.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I've already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves once again on the law and have therefore rewritten it.
We originally reported half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He can excite his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the go with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not gonna work.
The planned concert was held in May 2022 - "on instructions from the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during Advent must first come out, as it is called on the website of the singer who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to pick up their dates already 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has sung a lot and liked to sing as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with fellow musicians.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of percussion and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, the blonde hair has been strictly combed and labeled, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?

It still doesn't work I can only long the cover but not leaves.
Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has voted against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"No new apartment is created with an expropriation, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPDs, Greens and the Left will set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not conclude talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening up in the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price cut by 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still did not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever come again?

That's an absolute boldness.
At least 100 dead by tornados in Kentucky
In the event of a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been drawn through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 dead could be complained of.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday in the United States, several tornadoes have caused serious destruction and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long snowshoe of destruction, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said, after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was hit, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates alone in the Member State of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is it taken entirely from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
until when do you register?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, can I just order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change promotions
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising logos to call for vaccination - according to the German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to use Corona vaccines.
He moved to a company he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and sought something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'll finish a screen shot.

Aid for the first campaign of your own
Boron to the kiss!
I am currently leading for a group of 4 friends the adventure About the Greifenpass and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specially written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the single act is designed and now I am writing the entry adventure and knocking already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a fleet of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles away from the village, the hero is supposed to lure up a group of Goblins and lure them into a ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, early to recognize the danger whatever happens to the player.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed
In case of no sign, the Goblins are tearing up the heroes in a hollow path and flanking to three left and right of me bows armed the vehicle, while two spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and subjecting the heroes, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found and healed unconsciously and subsequently by the son of village school, a half-foot.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-alpha with two of his servants will enter, and the heroes will come to the aid of the battle.
The cart's still here, everything's great.
How well do you keep Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so not only cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll have a lot of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I've built the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then have the backlights come, I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm embarrassed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little airy with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today, in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the start-up accident of the schedule was far behind the schedule, you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
However, stupid, especially since Sky UK transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was again a lack of regular knowledge of the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that the tyres may be changed under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both of them came to the conclusion that they were allowed to switch tyres when there were corresponding radio talks on this subject to Hamilton.
With Sky UK and RTL both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for step-by-steps.
I think that such basic rules should be easily known when commenting on the F1 at a pay TV station.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or required according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject rules.
Generally, with the artificial comment style of Roos does not like, but admit that the taste is.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant foolishnesses, both of which simply make it unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from Ralf Schumacher's (even unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD".
Just the latter brings a great deal of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over from Sky, in the run-up round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, how to listen to F1TV, only the German sound track has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also advertise less in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV stations.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not leave me overlooked the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 is also very weak and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station that transmits the F1.
In Unironic terms, RTL is doing a better job in the four races, which they are still allowed to perform.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
Here you go: #PRS_ORG# Pendant lamp, brass and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.1919.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants.
Look into the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, it is possible to operate whole plants.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting more outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump but also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shells or something like that.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outsider or other... and it can be started.
The fan pump should be the same or higher as the water level and installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a back impact valve should be put in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, which runs the water from the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up daily here.
If everything is going well on the road, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is confused just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not rate the same bad, just because delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you'd love to talk about these services, even if we're saying right now... they're fucking hard.
This is also very different from one region to another.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.
The take-off and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly-elected astronauts after their return.
"Come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan, was an honorary guest of the company who had paid four passengers for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not report how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard in his efforts and had to do everything himself.
She just flew in like this, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would love to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres high
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometres above earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object stopped from large umbrellas landing again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out tour of Blue Origin: At the first in July Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest that Bezos and Blue Origin drive the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests to the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and even in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I also, of course, knew about career prospects before I studied, but also thought at the time that I would like to study and become a student until I received my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially distressing the professional outlook.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear always super professional opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you hear always from unemployed biologists and incredibly poor paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) As what are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am at the moment really uncertain and think in 2022 maybe interrupt the study and do a training as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experience there, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This subject came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's a post now.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are also days before holidays plus bridge days.
This was the case: Last week, Mariä was a Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter E-Mails, who absolutely had to go out before the ride, order here order there, everything *no matter* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that's not supposed to be?
Or because people all want to pay as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed then on Wednesday, but also powerfully tempered.
What is this self-sustaining about holidays?
Then what do we still have to do with holidays if we are not allowed to allow them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent of it.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and bastele with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But they still have a lot to do until the contemporaneous days: "I don't have any presents for the first time, I have to get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth flow of mouse and feather formation.
NECTON bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of poultry pests occurring in bird farming are exclusively due to dietary defects.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is essential for the formation of a perfect spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin treatment should be given during NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be administered simply via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still doesn't work yet
DDR-manufacturing model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare Lok probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model train operator ME Heft 11/1968, used with traces of play and defects see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy-duty electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy-duty trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a tatz bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau Reichsbahnfehrungswerk, the reworkability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03, while the remaining machinery was used as spare parts, were re-electrified by increasing re-electrification of the Central German network.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were first developed in larger quantities.
Only when the E 94 saw that the reprocessing rate could not be further increased did the E 95 draw attention to the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to Hall P.
They were mostly used in their own circular plan in front of coal trains from the Geisel towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complex control of locomotives proved problematic.
So it often occurred that shooters remained stuck at switching shops.
Then the beemann, who was constantly involved in this locomotive, had to release the shooter during the ride with hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the engines often occurred and led to months of failure on the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most of the splitters, leaving the E95 out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one more man, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the sight conditions of the driver station.
[5] Following the resignation of the E 95 02 and E 95 03 in the middle of 1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01 who left the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a folding heating system at the main train station Halle.
It took some time to convince those in charge of the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external reprocessing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a car show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then she has belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as an inoperative museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale), the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was first presented for an exhibition at Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior varnishing, with the transformers being checked and five engines operational.
-The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side tracks until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were re-homed to Leipzig as a central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary optical rework at the locomotive in self-work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual work model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and traces of storage.
Yes the F parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some.
The middle beam is held by two feet..lors are these too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced wrongly.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I'll get a new one sent.
When will they be sent out?
no, no, no, no, no, no.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right ones of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Main things they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Can I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area occurred, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reported to be hospitalized on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But that will come much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To deny fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccine photo
On the social network "LinkedIn", Uğur  waterin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-Chief Uğur  waterin had so far not publicly expressed himself on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona impression.
A friend's illness has moved him to tell him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur  the Netherlands, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,"  the author wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of myself on which I am vaccinated to counteract this false rumor."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old schoolboy is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, said Ahin.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often provoked by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is hard to deal with, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur says that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself made it clear.
"Mir is currently not allowed by law to receive the vaccine itself," said  the former.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to the appropriate information.
Fires in refrigeration plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a restraining station.
After a fire with severe damage in a bypass station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to escape for about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities with 41,000 residents affected.
The provider Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed at late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the Head of Primary Technology, Florian Witt, in a announcement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take some more days, as the western network operators could initially only temporarily re-initiate some lines, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Power flows back
The fire broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m., according to Westnet, seriously damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchage at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid bypass station.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work to be done.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been phased in from 9.30 p.m. on.
Since 11.15 o'clock also had the last electricity affected by the failure.
More than 80 installers of Westnet and partner companies were in operation.
Following the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or isolated people and report to local fire brigades when assistance is needed," said country councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the construction and operation of emergency power generators, the residents of Altenheimen were mainly in focus.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who need the flow-dependent medical equipment or who depend on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter from #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into one another and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, because otherwise they would not be suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to have a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it like that!
Do you send me the return note by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
However, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost shameless.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combination: Combination Ribber Wins
At the World Cup in Otepää in Estonia, the German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are printed on the podium.
The duo had to be beaten once again by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the race with great advantage after the ski jump.
Return order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes we have both re-made s and use the version 4.5...
Could be that they've heard of problems more often than not
Having directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
Just like I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect to log in to customer service.
As far as I can detect it, it is a #PRS_ORG#epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime!
To make the paint order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stitches.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly Strich next to Strich.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a smooth surface.
Avoid quick washing with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can come to unpleasant metal ropes when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
Original true appearances reach the models through the decals or decals.
From sovereign signs on airplanes to ship names to ornaments and badges for car models, the Decals give the model the last cut.
Put the decals in the right order, as long as the components are still well accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be or easier to bond before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pints and toothpicks are during sticky time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and apply it to you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you wet their back with water briefly until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then you just push the picture a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have already wetted).
As you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper so it does not stick to the finger, snap or even tear.
Swallow excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and sign in and reload the book and look for the place until where I've read.
AM Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Can I get this by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Okay, thank you very much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get that back?
Child desire treatment at PKV / What is a "insured case"?
Hello, together,
We have been in child’s desire for some time now, when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly sets itself across.
Next up:
We had applied for the children's wish in advance at the PKV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsatisfied) attempts, but they did not yet count on the PKV.
We asked again for the cost take-over at the PKV and again got 3 further tests admitted.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically calculate the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
Reasons: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 trials will be made with the first promise.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "the insurance case starts with healing, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts will be made) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have had to point out to us in the pledges that the further attempts with a birth would be lost?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was made and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything about the comedy coming to me completely disturbed
See what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It is clear that the repayment was made and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be of normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the barrier and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are promoted with additional shocks to be acquired, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly is a low budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxed.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's in it for you?
And maybe you don't like what?
I am a very good customer of you, already have 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With kind greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes the waiting position... I'll be back soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" linked to Belarus at high cost to the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania," said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not resolved the confrontation sustainably, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This sluggish state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The handling of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently there is "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot be enforced if a Member State is in a position to do its thing", as is currently the case for Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid a further prize for its border policy with Belarus, said Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection and border protection" had been strengthened.
Re-examining the border crossing
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have tried again to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
In the incident, the Polish officials had been sent stones to the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the reports, a soldier was face-to-face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
Overall, 52 border crossings tried to be registered within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU calls on Alexander Lukashenko, as a powermaker in Minsk, to have attracted her with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed down border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response was pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has put its market power on the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bans and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protested after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is supposed to have made two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 finale, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's steps in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have irregularly exceeded it.
A second opposition was filed against the ranking at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round Lewis Hamilton had passed the Mercedes and was stolen to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch car passing ahead of him had passed.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thanks for the support

But just because he says he's not an antisemit doesn't mean anything.
That's like when an abductor says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both will not give it to you.
But Colleagues constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should simply leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're not as serious as Colleagues.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science just tapped nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to take seriously like Colleagues
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatically-achromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone in a virtually incandescent and color-free manner.
Luppen are often marked with enlargement indications.
However, this information is only valid for precisely defined conditions which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to observe the information in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact valves.
By an anti-reflex coating these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Pine sale in Schönwolde: Women look for Christmas trees in the municipality of Krembz
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced such a curious situation at the sale of firberries.
Once, even without his partner, a man should have gone home because both could not agree.
Every year he plant well 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has experienced such a curious situation.
This always makes the pre-Christmas fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise, am I gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And both therefore have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit to a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbits to FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer gets the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes to (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before ( the previous one of 45 Mbits).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass so much Internet speed over the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to put LAN cable in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more than happy to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be peace with the Girokonts first, sees himself deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to get tricks from their customers to confirm the price increases of the past, the free rates for negative interest continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance once and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and fixed accounts and to 25.000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower exemptions apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with inventory customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an amount of EUR 25,000 or less, according to figures from the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have received justice before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing the possibility of institutions making provisions - in the event that the higher institutions also have to declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a mountain and valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made Furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers look after her.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a UNIT chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that you still have the hearts of the female and male fans to fly alike.
Maybe because she just has bad luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
She was sore.
The people who asked me that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make it happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and washed the sweat off the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to leave his Alfa Romeo after not half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishes his career in the motorsports royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the victory of the World Championship 2007 in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-star bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've been through this once, I'd have to go for nine and a half wins per season, and then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday he refused the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and drove out a larger advantage with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he performed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went to greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd win in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to second place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race in fourth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season with the women on her home run.
After only fourth place in the monobob the previous day, she won the World Cup on Sunday at the German three-time victory with the pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-year-old Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podium spot this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I'm super happy Mariama takes me with him.
I'm very happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just a move, but there's also a huge amount to do."
Jamanka got a little upset about the not quite error-free rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction".
I had the ceiling already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I have not just received it and therefore I have not been able to redeem why I have at last asked for it.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never had time for that.
And now it was said that he had run out of my mind what was very angry with me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is currently reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, it's only when I type on it that an extra field comes with the message
Was taken away from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered product.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just that day, only this week, only to XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe it's one - or others, too...
I am 24, I have KPTBS, full-time student and dogema - times apart from that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has got a burning 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cooked a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the association wg combustion).
On the other hand, it is cooled and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid just got stomach pain, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cuddly blanket, and he's relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and squeezing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just gone for a month.
Now also housework comes to us, which of course we share.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine, I'm half well-treated and I'm fine.
Not good, but I'm getting right and almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a bit of something.
And next week I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what's next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But that's what's going on?
Just till the birthday.
Only until the holiday starts.
Only for the weekend.
Just till...
And that's how it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these spiritual clues because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do it...
Is this how you do it?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
I am really grateful, I cannot say that at all.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this has some to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd probably find some people here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today Unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has impression.
At the first delivery the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is for them only another subject such as math or earth science.
For me this was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christianly and I always believed somehow.
How are you doing?
Perhaps you can also tell colleagues from work and study with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But simply find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in relativity theory.
What then leads you to want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
To preserve culture or something like that?
Hope you have a question that's not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in english I understand that well
It's been a very long time, so I'd ignore it.
All right, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for a movie Please help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any more closely in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers of curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into that realm in order to live himself I mean.
The transition is also, I believe, the burial site of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little girl just slept on the stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child holds much more than you think.
Make sure everything's all right, no cuddly animals, go in and watch more and more, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, they've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Is it turning your head sideways?
Can it get out of your stomach?
Or is the face ahead directly in the mattress?
Then you can tell if everything's okay.
We've all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was zb Gang and would be that you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stamping" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But then why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is thus not currently to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this transmitter is now all over the place.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big bet tour.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet channel.
Quote Arno: One wants to be "no running litfäss column".
What is it now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult people.
A trogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to find all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I'm asking you to call me, because my delivered wooden table was broken.
Body fracture caused by damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach pain or just for cuddle – My little friend of heat is versatile.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional means of home for soothing heat applications, since Kirschkern can absorb heat very well and return dosed.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is only suitable for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual smell, stick or fire spots and immediately dispose of if present.
Please take the inner cushion for heating out of the cover before!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (please note details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Distribute the heat evenly in the cushion immediately after heating!
Then put the inside cushion in the cover.
The first warmings can result in slight moisture formation at the surface, but these disappears during repeated applications.
Keep up with the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, test that the heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bruises and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If you have opened seams and loose cores leave, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious events related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Hannover 96 now works from the table counter.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed standing under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
This I bought about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Error indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore despite plugged power supply.
That's why I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is..
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold parts.
And what you need for everyday items is well organized and separate from the photographic equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2) the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalistic design has in itself – with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventional over the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal fastener with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack in the lock valve.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed various "filling racks": there are 4 anchor beams, which can be fixed to the fastener.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top beam, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
So the backpack can also be reliably closed without scratching the hooks.
The second option also differs fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to be mad at the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the daily fitness of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and store both without problems separate from each other - and through the two side openings also independently access it.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while the everyday stuff stays safely in the left backpack half and does not come in between.
Comfortable, easy adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I'm in vain waiting for the email from her support.
#NAME# yesterday I got an email from confirmation for ordering the
Contact was announced by the freight forwarder to collect the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate resolution.
I am now writing already with the third support staff, with none I came further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Well, let's see when the cabinet could be delivered again.
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I will immediately give up a larger order, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.
And that last year was different than I thought, I couldn't imagine and just couldn't redeem and clear it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking can also be appreciated under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (bore and cut).
All known discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The well-known discs thus manufactured ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our well-known discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright bridges in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called 'California Gold Rush' from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were laid down, tents opened, and rooms and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, co-drive horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You've got to beat your pioneer colleagues so you don't mess with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to budget with your resources and build a Tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year when gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose secretly and simultaneously a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
The players then carry out alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening up shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are complete, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prizer turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This continues until the bidder moves five times, so each location has hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gun heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score.
The player with most winning points wins!

"Why Children Are Not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyranns" (2008) he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now raising serious charges against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, ever, ever! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetchek: Countries advise on the removal of the test requirement for triple vaccines
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the countries wish to decide on a nationwide ban on the testing of three-fold vaccines.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and when three times vaccinations can escape the test obligation," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinations was "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetchek said.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Ministers for Health next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear noises/voices, to see images more rarely, and to observe pain most rarely.
Relevant for this topic: Imperial cuts are operations that go with an increased rate of awareness, since to protect the child a very deep narcissism is avoided until the navel.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the narcose pre-interview.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.

But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ don't help us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check them again if they at least take the defective chair back.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
There's a lot of money we're losing.
I already sent you an e-mail that you did not answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they were only delivering at the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I will not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and an instructor.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, printed fresh: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow departure from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I bear witness here to my life's life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the European standard wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was at EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not collected

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got here a week ago lots of great tips for the perfect goulash.
It was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and sweet!
So thank you again for :)
Now I've come to taste and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time to New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a stove, I only have a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01 that the refund was made.
But until today the money has not been received by me.
I'd like you to check.
Where there are still Christmas brats in the room of Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
We're running out of time.
We'll tell you where you'll get another Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor style.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the concentration of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which can reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
Further above, it already sounded that the POWER LEVEL controller can even float a power reserve if it goes loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
The signal in this case is processed with a box simulation, so that even when you use a headphone or when taking direct pictures, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
AUX can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you also spend a VFS5 foot button, you can also easily call up the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effects blocks and "drop" the pace of the resulting compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX will take another step in the future!
But you would have seen it that way with others.
Is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because she's too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me with that?
What about the comedy?
Do we receive an update on the exact delivery date again in the next weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher as well.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need then are a little bit much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress has been made, according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday at the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", as at first there was no agreement on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement had continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State Now Federal State with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The only federal state is the value above the 1000 mark.
The only federal state in Thuringia was located at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the 7-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had shown the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 patients of Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come after the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick to the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
I don't have to click or fill in any more here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is, in my view, a delicacy.
It is time for changes
I am delighted on Monday, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the mail for here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of MBundestag you can see one thing: It is not extist.
We came into a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
# What's the problem?
Yeah, what did it lie on?
For the most part, this is simply related to dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we are general.
In the last few days, the impression has become more and more that many here really still have Bock on MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag, which wants to keep it alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a bunch of shears, simply.
After some writing down and rewriting, several people from the community found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call once again on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server on which we can share each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders have to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How are we supposed to appear outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, so at the end of the day we have the Discord.
If you have the desire and the time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a light shield from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is there also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by telephone at any time to agree on a collection date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or decide to return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarianally for a while, she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself used to be a vegetarian for a few years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be a vegan, and Vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I as a vegetarian would support animal welfare, but at some point I had reflected and understood that with it I also support animal torment.
Therefore, my decision to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that on her side came up with discouragement, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and one reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "blump" was?
How does the question answer?
Have the feeling that you as a Vegan are quickly put into a corner and that conflicts arise, without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for remote distribution.
I am not picking up my returns on the assigned date #PRS_ORG#.
Because I can't be there because of a funeral, unfortunately this can't be changed.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhine-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewenz from Lahnstein City Hall issued a grant notice of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us with this," says Peter Labonte, Mayor of Lahnstein.
The device car is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in the water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you can count on increasing efforts: The boom of the hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could read only 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
Following their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app has been reloaded NOTHING worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has taken me a long time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I make an appointment in the ordering process?

Thank you for standing here for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, say we were arms carriers in the executive, I don't want to go on with it!
I find the question of right and left always very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms carriers, people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can deal with the living reality of course is also clear, because, of course, next to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't mean the excessive female clichés now, because these are in the executive rather less to not at all but quite normal men and women to whom you don't notice when they can't tell you) and also to these people and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they save your life or put it in for you.
But also these marginal groups represent even though it sounds strange to me first of all, according to a conservative attitude, say, are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing policies, even though this policy is supposed to be working for them or is meant to be right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-dangerous plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police and soldiers who were often in foreign employment often start to pauscalize due to negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes right-wing contemporaries meet who carry on a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, this is what I think is being well fought and countered by political education and education!
Germany is so very international and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yeah, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could supply the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wood part are two deep cores filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a little scratch
More regular by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working on one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (be independent, very little leisure time), but for my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household clean and neat.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it unpacks me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never so 'that someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is not better either, it bothers me somewhere, but most often household simply loses against work and failure.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now, to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We do not yet have anything to do with it, and I have been dealing with this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or are you sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preform with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arms and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4 the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axis, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in step ensure a close, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the loin vertebrae area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves the comfort, especially when bending and installing the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility for movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with a finely adjustable wide adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which is not attached to the casket or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on wrists and ankles combine a foldable inner cuff with a soft, hidden neoprene outer cuff
45° curvature at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load-bearing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slide and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bundled with outer and inner overlap
The edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater loadability
Curved edges of inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insured personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have for a long time been considering re-starting and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insured (or frightening) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people at the material level, but I find it very difficult to have easy conversations and I have been told more often that I am working incompetence (where I think this has already improved).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in search counselling or family support.
However, I do not know whether the actual working day is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it pulls me down each time when there is something to object to my code ("the simplest things stacked up again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know for myself now how this is going"/"I hold him off with my stupid questions from work"/"he really has to think me for less average" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But you've got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a date to pick up
What do they mean by giving back, please?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# will not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed dissipates the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and, in turn, builds up its own protein, which it also needs for the formation of the feathers.
The nesting and re-moaning of the nesting bird are extremely complex and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's total organism.
Please note that NEKTON bio must not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be a disturbance in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparations) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparations) should be used again for daily vitamin supply.

1 g NECTON bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A dashed measuring spoon (in the case) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the feather formation is visible.
The normal dose is then reached until the re-formation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to let you know that my order has been damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a municipal employee in the resounding of the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be fallen on our property.
So a trap application was submitted to the municipality.
An employee tells me that the case of fruit trees and hence the walnut is not part of the constitution.
In the Statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that's the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that out?
News in brief: Heavy traffic accident at Selb
Recently a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police news alert reports (14:03 a.m.) a passenger car has arrived in the counter traffic.
There are wounded.
Oh, okay.
All right, thank you again for going so easily!
Advice and ideas on further working life
Merry Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation - that is of you.
I'm making the ref as a cross-country climber.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more precisely here).
But then I was too bored and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up at the teaching office and was sure that it was - even if the conditions are clearly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings".
And it's only six months from now.
I have always decided to continue with the paintings before and at least to finish the ref, after which I can still swing.
But I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now are holidays, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
In front of the Ref, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my party evening my party evening.
I was free to do that.
And the stress at work didn't matter at the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
Basically it is fun and from the outside the Ref also runs well as regards the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely lukewarm and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if he doesn't already do that.
I wonder whether I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - precisely when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for and put together in a team that worked out and not as an individual fighter like that now most of the time is the case.
But then I wonder if I did not get back in the same place in a year as now and was dissatisfied.
You know, it's kind of weird, but maybe you've come out of this situation, which I'm completely finished with, and I'm about to start crying at the smallest thought about it.
I'm not going to make any decisions so emotionally right now, that's probably not going to do anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizes for the winey undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been continuously developing, which has led to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" approach, which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp switches, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just blow.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound like you've always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modelling technology is due primarily to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which has once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum range of sounds here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a greasy sound, a nuantitious play of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt approach.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the final stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor style of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic Lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually plazier and foldable Velcro connectors, it is designed to suit the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three alternate lenses and a flash of plug.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for other things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano break on La Palma: probably longer history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, volcanologists did not continue to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television broadcaster RTVE.
Damage to millions of dollars
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, cold lava gave rise to two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly affected by the vastly important banana cultivation of the island, of which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have linked to the spiritual atmosphere and the chilling tension a little seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which after the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-making "social treaty of natural peoples", can be avoided and revitalized in the context of this tradition.
As from Nikolaus the Christ Child became
The Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift, were strictly taken.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another at the Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gift the popular custom in Germany emerged to fill the boots above all of the children with gifts.
Protestants came up with this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they hold their own against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the gift shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as this, it is only the least upset that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still a fixed part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to Martin's use with Martinsingen and Martin's move.
Today you will find everything the heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought-after luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources demonstrate a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Day of Gift moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian - shaped lands, however, there is a joyous flock of flocks on the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christ Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, who with time have been assigned some peculiarities.
These include, for example, his white noise bar, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyriar bar of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeers and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana, who should have shown them the way to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fable beings bring gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses who pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for the gift delivery.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
On Saturday, near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly afterwards by officials.
Shots had fallen and the man had been hit.
He was found dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not leave a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace there are several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply mounted and can be anchored with 2 earth spouts in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous hours max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic design can be used all year round in the outdoor area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is harmless: alone, the sun makes this solar light shine fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades of colour).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at day.
Its organic rounds fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, lawn or stone beds.
He also makes himself well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows to claim himself thanks to his size.
Great preliminary work can be saved: As a solar light »Smart Stone« does not require any supply or batteries.
Place the »lightstone« at any place that looks like the sun.
If necessary, two supplied potatoes will provide a firm hold.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When the dawn comes, »Smart Stone« begins to shine automatically; in what color, you determine it yourself: The same six attractive colours of light are available for you to choose – besides daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off is automatic as soon as the battery charging position has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.

Pill Problems
Hello, ladies,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I'd love to let that stay again, because through chronic diseases I have to take enough drugs that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten my last about two years of break from 0 to 100 explosive pickles and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I've had a great deal of stress on it and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without any tolerances, but maybe there is something that anyone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the woman doctor didn't take me that seriously and the skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the skin you love is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertär bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale knee bonds and acne theme.
I tried everything I could and stayed on sugar, milk and low meat mixed foods during my illness because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that hormoneell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me have construction site everywhere you want to stop looking no more going what else goes wrong.
I already had everything in my colleague semina o. o.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...

110 kV earth cable will be newly built 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The plan-setting decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the main line.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bezel number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipping number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Unable to deliver".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how this is going?
A beautiful start into the week!
You can forget, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a comic of glass and the whole sides are open, so it is all over the place and the carton is broken.
The comedy is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the comedy can't be picked up because no one can get into my apartment
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER#EUR
No, it's all the books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Plan of instruction (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I have still big problems to plan my lessons in Earth science in time-efficient.
Unfortunately, technically my school is not well equipped, so I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In addition, I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for Earth science).
I just need very long at the moment to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the subject of geofactors and I am actually standing by every hour.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always leave the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a professor of Earth science how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to handle the returns as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G rule around the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or healed are allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales breaks.
A possible solution is available.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business.
In transactions involving items of non-daily demand, sales breaks should be complained, criticised HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many people would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail trade as well as in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the Chief Executive Officer.
"2G during shopping does not carry us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers and required a high level of personnel.
The volume system had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
Thereafter, every customer had to be checked only once for 2G (vaccinated or healed) and had access to all shops with the volume received on that day.
In addition, sampling should be sufficient in the retail sector, such as in public transport, in the case of the 3G regime (vaccinated, healed or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas shop.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, with sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Officer Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "the visitors can once provide their 2G proof in a central location in the center, for example, and then enter all shops undisturbed - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and at the frame is also an error that has been tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have it packed and glued back into the package.
How do I have to proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The light creates a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree radiation angle with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply press one of the storage keys by pressing longer.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when new switches are switched on the known situation is restored - very convenient when working in studio if e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester with the same installation - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top indicator, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with electricity continuously over the supplied power supply.
The design of the headlamp is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection so you can directly to your photo tab.
The inclination is to be adjusted reliably on both sides by means of fasteners.
It has been observed that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a needle joint is included in the delivery.
Great is that in the scope of delivery also a bag is included.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a towering comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes the last two times in a series of victoryless Hesse were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga-pliete.
But then the SGE turned up, set off within a good hour the frustration over a continuous start of the season from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's insane what the guys have done today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal praise to every single one who was with them".
At first it looked like a new damper for the now ranked nine still below their expectations Frankfurter.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," says Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
The morale of his teammates was also emphasized by defense player Christopher Lenz, who had been able to get back in place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcame muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself well positioned in terms of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all fit players in December, that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also players live highly professional.
Now you want "to continue step by step and remain modest" and the tasks "to go through at this level until the end of the year".
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week, there will be an outing at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 am, Sky) on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and letting it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
I would then, unfortunately, like to say that I am not going to order again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Steamers for handball women before quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women bark after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty gazes from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup, the DHB selection was defeated at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to race against host Spain in the quarter finale.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8.2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game for everyone that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semifinals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup seconds in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in Duell with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," Xenia Smits admitted, saying, "We need to look forward quickly now."
From the front to the back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the call was not on the high.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4-return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a rapid counter-strike.
However, this was not the intended initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and though, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke soon later saw red because of a hard fold on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, they may take part again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and until the break at least reached five goals.
The still silent hope of a catch-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners' protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-imposed opponent, who was one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer rise to an increase in performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

Is this about them?
The title exists, I am a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated especially in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely finished, some of them will continue to be used in vaccination centres for me.
I like to answer questions without any time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal (e.g., "I take medication X, this is true of vaccination.").
My area of responsibility includes the information on vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a Corona vaccination and no reason to oppose it), medical documentation and emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never done so before).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but who cannot carry out vaccinations (can I do it?) so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy Huidler Question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television broadcast "Wir in Bavaria" has been provided for intense reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unheard of by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg told of was the solution and thus also made for astonishment in many upper Palatinates.
"The Huidlers," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectist Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinateic term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "huderern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for some who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, you will always get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n.
Nothing helped.
Tyre selection at the racing bike- really so pan safe?
This morning I woke up busy because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Says, did, and I drove my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in so every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) is so.
Glass splits on the track.
Zack, loud squeezing and my rear tire didn't want to take the rest of the track any more.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around with a bad mood and take the first track home.
It wasn't quite that bad in mood technology, but maybe it's better if I practice the change of tire again before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would like to get extremely unpleasant about this problem more often.
Now was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I got the bike torn down until 2 p.m. 120km!) and who had already called it a sub-optimal because he was driving with them for many years.
But if I think that I still have to change tyres after 80-90km, then I think I'm really badly tempered :D
Now I came into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who surprised me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very enticing.
But are these really so unmanageable?
I don't want to spend 40€/reef now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I've been on the racing bike right now I think 25x622.
Although these are also (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a racing bike in general about other tires?
The Schwalbe-Site seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car slugs against tree: driver fatally injured
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old, with his car, had struck a central island for unexplained reasons, and then went to the reverse lane, as the police reported.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured during the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be re-emerging.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new sprayer and is reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal a suitable designed foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the conditions at home.
As a matter of principle, SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but which is to be reached at an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered sound pressure levels of this kind.
However, this does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is highly adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high tone increase.
This is common in broadband bands in order to optimize the rapidly increasing bundling over high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely oriented towards the listening area and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high tone range can be easily rotated to the outside, making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that its same seeks.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution capacity and accuracies.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to decorate the housings, you need to adjust the speaker's lowering accordingly, as the veneer again carries material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to perform the cable there without any problems.
With the help of a top milling machine, the speaker is now opened in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in good time.
On the back side, this opening should be fitted with a 45° frame to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwpoints of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, if, for example, you want to use finished wires from the construction market instead of making them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
The second page is attached in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, and the front follow.
By means of a suitable hole saw or a forest drill, the application of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then you use a round cutter to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footboard can also be rounded off.
At the end, the foot plate is fixed with the foot of the case and screwed with long wooden screws.
The coupling points of the speaker chassis and the terminal terminal are followed by the markings and pre-drilling (2,5 mm drill).
After the housing has been cleaned from wood dust (swallow / blow out), you start by laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, you push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot until the terminal opening and let it stand out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it is also left loose there.
The frequency softness is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency softness and the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency softness is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening is sealed inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and so close.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus cable (marked cable) at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact) has to be soldered.
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I already give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be organising the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by turn, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
If you have drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
