It seems like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in the rugby is big anything...
Yes, we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break nobody's nose during the drinking games (in the end, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme that says that.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first-year students' brochure seemed to me to be quite typical.
However, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go much further than misogyne jokes and jokes under the control of alcohol that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students particularly shows that they are trying to cause as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your injuries and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
Issued from very different backgrounds from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So the " misogyne jokes" are acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races through campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't specify it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in peace.
therefore also this interstellar cloud (ofe, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of the water of your pastis has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well then we can still consider that the fleet of pasty has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad as that
A sacred foot of nose to the disasterists and reheaters of any hair who warn us of the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
An irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: What is evidence that the warming stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signage?
So you do not understand much about ecological problems.
It is not a question of "disasters" as you say to worry about the disparagement of the oceans, but rather about the reduction of human consumption of water reserves (you know the freshwater that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then, more generally, it is not the global warming that is most threatening for our species but, above all, the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that withstand our lifestyles more and more gourmet.
As for the study that you quote and which you make the generous effort to quote the source, there is of course little doubt about the truthfulness of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I reassure you the French are far from concerned xD Then you have to stop looking at ecology as a perfect dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimate at 100% by 2050 at the current rate).
Yes ecology, religiously dogmatic and unwarranted ecology, not thank you.
"Then it is necessary to stop looking at ecology as a no-failing dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly" Yes, it is not like it was a spontaneous movement that would not come from anything.
@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of greenhouse exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 good men would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
Probably not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving back, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of that idiot in the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any allowed climate model give priority to replanting.
It is not logical, since CO2 is the food of the plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora around the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been set flat.
Did you see the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is only a false distraction.
And before you launch your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is fallacious and deserves to be ridiculous.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electorate.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants perform less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people have to eat them in far greater quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
It is obvious that this Member is a child.
So far, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from departing from the rules of the 17th century.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible to the world, even if the NNA settlement is not a tax treaty.
That this lady does a whole thing isn't to her credit, it mostly seems like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who denounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Académie" had faltered: "Let us say to Mrs. the guardian or the guardian of the Seals" (post that until then had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machinism!
"The political arena" ....!
The sandbox, the back yard of the Republic replicates, the marigar of operettas , the table of illusions ,etc ...
But the arena involves gladiators, people who take real risks, please, badly.
Qd the Umpiste phallocrate sits on the label and the parliamentary settlement distorts the + elemental civility under the false umbrella of the right ways, the penalty applies to him "quality" for his stubbornly partisan and his misuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He makes provocation to make him talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can boast of being known as any cancer of a primary class.
The Academy on the back and we see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to address its internal problems and stop causing the coucs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when they tell her what she doesn't say.
This Member behaves like a colleague in the middle of the teen crisis, who is provocative and whose friends are going to, in a delegation, see the Principal for cancelling the hours of glue.
and defending it on the basis of a text that they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this rostrum of UMP Members.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two expert witnesses who have been separated for thousands of years.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when playing is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, hostages, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure they get.
In contrast, it would seem that we are passionate about the majority of our 80-year-olds to work, move and shop.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lives, but we pass the majority in trouble.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates if the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of nonsense about animals that are "playing" while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it may or may not be), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play at the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes him live...
Thanks the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the info without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be enthusiastic enough by those who seem crazy first of all.
But when we see what many people have learned from their schooling at school, especially among the most likely public to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of anchoring.
"the most likely public to engage in attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, that's good, we got it.
And yes, reality does not always feel the rose, even if it does not necessarily correspond to your patterns of thought.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her phone6.
The distraught youth of Evry too!
If the reagents no longer react, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first place.
I didn't learn anything about all this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my intentions).
Do I have to think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And are young socialists going to the suburbs schools to teach human-female equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing mounts on Twitter, but you should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're nothing everywhere, but to teach morals, it's the best.
Everything looks like a photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article won't go anywhere.
It's not time to make jokes around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double-sounded word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less we have in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by the weight or number of calories, as is the quality of a film or a piece not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monk?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more food.
Of course, it must not be so.
The Sportsman at Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you will be to receive a portion of your child arranged with art in your plate.
At least they've made the effort to put on a table.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good food?
Is the Manif for All only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just this.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "children's manufacturing" systems.
A child shall not be raised in a battery rearing or made by a technological device.
Battery raising?
Where do you get that from?
And if you contest any technical intervention in "manufacturing", you must demand the prohibition of the LDCs for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am surprised, moreover, that the so-called "for all" script does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest themselves: the other religions too, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup violently opposed the will of the gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "defense of the family".
We are always in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is to say, the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be a catho to be indignant at the trafficization of the stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom ends with the freedom of others: yes, the recognition of homosexual couples who have the same right to love themselves as others.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a furniture object.
And this is also valid for GPA search heteros.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of wild stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker other than Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article speaks of the goals he scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa didn't bring or bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why he won much more often than, let's say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommend 119 It's the fashion to criticize Rooney right now so you can be forgiven for doing so too.
That said, it's good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive passes in 93 games.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and scored 32 points in 96 games.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
By the way, "Wazza" is rather a good reason for ridiculousizing it.
I have to ask myself if you're really looking at football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's abilities come from as a football player.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Do you seriously compare Wayne Rooney's football skills (even not as an attacker) to those of Peter Crouch?
Are you doing this without joking?
There really are people in the crowd.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been England's goal-oriented front-center machine during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the lead away, Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written this by joking.
In a country where the weapon-carrying is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way of doing things.
Well, those of this school just don't agree at all with the weapon port authorization in the United States!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids are playing with actual guns at this age in our house?
Does that make murderers in power, however?
Even though the armed bearer is in the U.S. Constitution and this necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that the Rican kids are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason kept svp.
It's an unarmed process!
You're out of touch!
Information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not at all has, the initials for the taste of morbidity.
Can we assume that a serial killer can't have a strange behavior at the age of five?
If people need a mental follow-up, it's more the maboul of this school than the students!
Let the parents get their kids out of there: she's in danger!
That's all right.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your response is the most relevant.
The Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These striking blue costards men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wearing at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled pulley.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at it, but everything seems so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrarior, perhaps?
But what's that look like?
You've been ahead of me.
I would have thought that a poor knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostrace", he meant "alienate."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have said, but ostracising still doesn't make any sense.
Worst of all, if all candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could move on that their intention was to ostracize him.
But here, no.
It seems that it has been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Who knows what he was able to say?
I'm sure nothing, but someone definitely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "ostrace", which absolutely didn't mean anything.
The rate of unemployment in the United States fell again in August, some 6%.
Never seen it since 2001.
Gasoline prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
To live there right now, I'll say that the United States is getting closer to the explosion as inequalities get crazy.
The political system is literally ruined by the state of financing electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a size that is not imagined in Europe but Americans maintain incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial community said that France was lost.
Now it is America that is at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
One more of these articles simply forget the essentials.
The level of consumption of the U.S. economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards could not give the exchange much longer...
Based on the depletion of Earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "torn" or rather shatter.
I can't take this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that his cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad makes him lose even more support in his home?
Probably not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the swamp, it plays at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed to "feed the right nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in secure seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Did you talk about your struggle against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this return of manipulation, the pendulum has started very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will leave in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour secure seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories saw a lot worse, but for Labour it's a victory at the Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "victoire" in any context, and you will see that when used in an argumentative manner against the word "lose", it wins the battle!
I agree Jack, it's a win, but she's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record performance like that in a secure seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice of Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia are tough.
On the other hand, I wonder whether the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "pastous" or malleable than we imagine.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand Wylie tells us about a "quick mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's coast, the pressure on the mantle laughs, which gives a) a whirlwind to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "slash" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be (more or less) localized.
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa With regard to global warming, it seems to me prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcanicism have an effect on our environment?
Does it affect our global warming, future or past?
Is there any reason not to warm up?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's night, we'll see less.
Hello, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, especially in the "active mountain chains" where on the continental parts very frozen Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordialement CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it climb or descend from some 30 to 60 cm, at a delay, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the sliding of tectonic plates, as well as the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bump, especially since polar callottes are lightened by the melting of ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the land to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human," saying to myself the Supreme of Nature and his self-proclaimed commander-in-command, ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created him and so separate that he has become harmful to himself and to that environment.
And all this in order to remain the supreme commander of this nature that surpasses it in the organization of its own viscera, by an invention that consists in finding all the means possible to dominate its neighbor, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's ridge is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Vividly the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant series of about 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost nobody remembers now.
It's a shame you've never passed beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Geladas, our distant ancestors" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh, there I don't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to be bee-eyes in front of a brain in a bowl.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, having to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
So she needs to be self-sufficient, or non-compliant.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and its intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structure the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor ...
We are well in the individualism of mass!!
Without making it an inexhaustible horizon, there is no relation to the Cartesian approach of looking at what one receives to believe, what one believes himself.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionist is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and rely on it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
In setting the problem at the paranoia of his nomadic nomadic, he blocked all progress and thought about the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision that supports: Behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and to be an anti-conformist, it is fighting against this renvelage.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defenceman.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, we ask each other...
Blacks and rebuffs, everyone else.
Buffs and robots, include the most followed by those who see themselves rebuffs in their mirror.
At any rate, thank you to his protesters for setting Marcel Gauchet under the spotlight of the current day, this patient and persevering humanist, and so educationally enlightening.
David Cameron supports the increase in the inheritance tax threshold
How many more budget cuts will be required to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will increase his net value well once he won't be in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has left the gun.
Obviously, he doesn't want a inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the least of inheritance taxes through super well-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining empire where heritage kills innovation.
He'll be 100 £ once he's put the gun on the left.
Anything.
It will probably promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a headless tribalist?
We didn't vote it the last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Just like the rest of us, "Dave" won't die "normal".
Climate change and the imminent collapse will end him and the rest of his acabit.
His "rich" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1 000 000 000.
We must all be imposed to pay essential services and repay debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline teaching is unnecessary, of course I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "insufficiencys".
Unwise statement for the math teacher that it was!
Like what?
Better recruitment and training of teachers is part of a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible responses, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to pass on knowledge => reform of recruitment procedures.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establishing a defiance relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => she needs 1 training to teach.
A job that learns, certainly.
But pedagogy is primarily an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
Pedagogy doesn't equalize even when you're a math teacher!
"Educational sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing, precisely, is a true vocation in bcp of those who embrace the profession
If the gifts exist, the pedagogy (I prefer discipline didactics) allows those who have less ease of doing not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today is the students whose 1-3 tell us: learning does not serve anything I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's retaliate the old Normal Schools of Teachers..
It ends at 3 a.m. starting this week, but it starts at midnight.
If that's the case, it's the right time job anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
I don't like it!
It's been years since his show starts at midnight.
We have this thing that is called iplayer and that allows us to listen to shows on demand whenever we want!
The Internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a typical usb adapter on the back of my SKY box, which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems to me too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong about the schedule, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3:00.
Although they are men in the day on Radio 2, they could put at least one woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
His show is at any rate sensationally disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a channel like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular facilitators, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show in the evening at the return of the job, is a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shenan knows well, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the semi-detachable one these days.
Jeremy Vine may be returned to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get a laugh or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For the past 40 years we have had the same parties that alternate in power and make the country's keys less good than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnasium, a theatre.
But since they don't burn a car, don't touch it, don't deal with it, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you didn't live.
Yes , Doclocal , these are subjects of men , sociology is good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism, too...
The FN prospers on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance so much that it still has enormous growth potential, they really need to be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN is especially successful in poverty, in fear of everyday life, in fear of the other, and in feeling that it has no prospect.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save honor.
They've been looking for him.

That's what happens.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource =>lower staffing.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by this is that in many developing countries existing standards are called into question, such as child care and social-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that is great - that is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize the gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex is not up to the next!
Profits make fun of your life.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The profits are mocking the heroism and the education of children.
If it were a crime companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be equal to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (without talking about the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find true "economic empowerment" out of their homes...
Thank you for all your comments - to go back to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when conducting gender mainstreaming projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot people who need to "check a box."
The tiger is not Russian it is only Western propaganda.
China alone is responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger on the right to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, scheduled long time before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in its possession.
Release the Tigristan!
You make my day!
Oh, yeah, there you go.
He immediately came to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext found to arm a few separatists to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it is that China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, gorgeous feline and in danger of extinction finally turn into an article bettting lead against Putin?
What's he got to do with it?
This is therefore not a leaf on Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the consequences of a Putin Comar operation.
When you expose yourself to so much media, you expose yourself to irony, or even criticism.
The constant victimization of soviet sympathizers.
Holland had also taken the pear with her camel without shouting at the anti-French plot.
Here our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of the great Russia personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger he understood everything, he barred himself...
That Hollande gets down there, that's one thing.
At first sight, it seemed a horribly condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and an effective one.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say again.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed the front teeth, and 73% later, it makes a little sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there are no inconveniences to brush your teeth!
In fact, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee said the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seemed reasonably well thought out.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the skin of the skin.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on Guiness's record book where someone had tried to brush their teeth the longest and judges Guiness at the time had strongly advised him not to do so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged brushing of teeth.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
It seems like an experimental crap design to me.
Simply volunteering for this study will change the habits of participants who knew that brushing of teeth would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person who has social benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about when they grow or not brush their teeth (results easily fucked up by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) can have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits can be transmitted to the next generation.
Does uterus transplantation affect this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you don't want to have a perfect clone of yourself, is this a problem?
It seems to me that it goes beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for maternity and paternity should not drive us to go further and further, without asking ourselves the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, no it is not boundless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the trun
But let people, women, others, have their body, their notion of love that can go to risk-taking and manage your little testicles on your own, on your own in your little pants on your own.
of their "confier this magic bag" so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him rigidly in my safe if he can still give love.
The current rigidities make PR FRYDMAN careful of its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What are we going to suggest as an anti: see here these reactions all male curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing to say.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally anodine.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood both for the receiver and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one sense or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women talking about it.
@Margane: in fact, it has nothing of an anodine, and it strengthens the act of love it implies.
Give a kidney to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have an anodine either, and that's what's happening!
Please, do not combine Messi v Ronaldo.
It's down.
I'm okay, we don't need that.
Especially since there's no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo became a yoyo club.
They are too good for the Segunda but do not have the standard of the League.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the goals records of Real Madrid this season to then be able to return to Old Trafford this summer with the quiet conscience...
I'm having a hard time believing it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the international oil investment company stage?
I was looking at it on a shit connection so I can't tell you much about it if it's only Valencia have defended and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the middle of the field would get over too fast but they played well.
The game of Parejo in general becomes better.
A terrible penalty was cowardly claimed but justly saved by Diego.
A heated Mestalla and it didn't have to be funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archéologia 524 last September.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what is thought intuitively.
It's not surprising that before we get complicated, we made it simple.
All science is progressing by small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman thus preserved was?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
He had appeared to me to read a few times ago that a black child’s mom had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, including geographical and temporal ones (I think I remember that the mom was earlier than 1000 years with the first known African moms).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks in advance.
She's a little uncomfortable with reading.
These may not be modern-day contamination.
Was the desert then not less distant than it is now?

We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to say so, even without any proof, that it is a scientific truth: Egyptians and therefore Africans yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song doesn't tell us who the inventors of African inventions in Africa are.
If it is not always "of its well-known developers".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market, which preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola and on whom the Spanish Government is lying to us, so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those of Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of enterprises rather than those of individuals.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is just a bunch of fools, good at nothing and corrupted, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt it is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and his colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that it is important.
If they were absolutely to return the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service by privatizing the nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is its basis of power, until the courts intervene.
It's just a right-wing judge in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed up next election.
To be just to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far to his right and would find his place towards the right-wing religious madmen in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before gone down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
These are cases apart, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Free Comments.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get out of it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE patrons - SMEs seem to read The World to take time to condemn Pr.
Let's move on the anti-intelligence of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the Collège de France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely.
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr.Villermé noticed the child's 8-year-old work 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot in sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Oh, good old days.
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of the TPE boss profession!
His profession is not to know the law in all his meandres, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts written on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, which could be cited much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, which are imposed without measure of consequences, and which stifle small businesses.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a sorbon client.
For the sake of the arch-ressed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code relative to the Helvet, a serious university would have plunged into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts, and then the amount of comments (the absence of them may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, the case law is addressed in particular...
And yes, in France, there is yet another judge who is responsible for applying the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
Who is it complicated with?
Do you find the rules of law (law, jurisdiction, conventions, contracts) to be unbearable barriers to work and trade?

Pullmann "Art has virtually been immune to criticism, Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is certainly time for revolutionary new absurdities to chaf the critics...
For every article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are among the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on!
Go and see elsewhere, there is no shortage of choice in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not the spokesmen of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think the art of AI Weiwei is a kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose him at all costs (no bad word play).
It's the guy who's breaking up old, irreplaceable ceramics and calling it art, isn't it?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
The real artists make the difference.

KARSENTY DEMISSION this gentleman is unqualified to occupy an electoral mandate extremists of any ship (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and the town hall of Neuilly.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth on his own, on the margins.
WHAT RESEMBLE IS ASSEMBLE
What does the Mayor of Neuilly intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who insults a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for this urbanist to attack?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This guy needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy, and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
Just as many people believe that in any political decision they see the hand of "sionists" (the meaning of which tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, like the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, of an anti-Semitism abject "that is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would be believed to have returned to Russia of the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's reporting are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of plotting on September 11 are a mess.
And this type of person has political responsibilities, that is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the theory of the plot of September 11, we talk about cognitive dissonance regarding how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally crazy truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adept of this theory to be detached (as in the case of extreme religious).
As a result of a logical and inescapable leak forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complete but complete not seeming to disrupt the mission of the person concerned.
You recommend that you pay attention and not put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you're doing for September 11.
There are still a host of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/Consorts don't seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed very strange theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokesmen find that the results of the study are widely supportive of their advocacy efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what needs (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think this is an attack - are you going to drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than putting my mental health at risk by abstaining.
The government ends the pleasures when it costs it money.
Here are other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should work together (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to pay them in full, like smokers!
They already do - soon it will be the grass!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years of age.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturdays (and the other evenings when my wife is not there).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used This is an old news that the Cancer Council deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk today???
Sharks do not catch cancer - they eat anything but they are not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one can run and vice versa.
Complete agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing yes.
To both of them, they destroyed the F1 on a security pretext.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or worse Wendlinger at his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but attention on point 1: it's not the F1 but the bodies of the circuit who refused to move forward so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Very accurate, +1
I just want a quick and quick recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that almost occurred between trouble-shooting cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How could the race organization and the FIA have allowed these manoeuvres without getting out the safety because?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the trade or the fault without luck when we haven't prevented the predictable.
But it was the accident.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not merely mean "ban on crossing the area" but has the primary purpose of reporting a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunately for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under a yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their foot.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more pitiful after the turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even be "reduced" at a speed relative to a normal rhythm.
Well, we're talking in the vacuum there, until we see the pictures, we can't make a statement.
I don't see too much of this change.
Are there any wounded people?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there's still some work to be done 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people who are injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not derail as enchantment and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains are very, very often in a day's time.
In addition, as roads often follow rivers in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated places, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all the rail traffic crosses the center of a city since this was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a story about this last night, really shocking.
Of course, you didn't read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the railway.
However, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Railway Corporation of Canada are expected to visit the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are trained extensively in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, makes the primary religious issue a deadlock: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforce this fact, if not what is good to talk about the angelic sex?
"God said: that's good - that's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim countries but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?" .
In other words, obey the parish priest to enjoy Rabbi Imam and make your prayers, it will be better!

May His Appendix Nooillesque touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in some way trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its worship: the one of the strong euro ( rather flat at this time ) or the one of the free market ( fairly supported by the state when you have to inflate) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious upswings.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is on the tug and expresses himself in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods served the ambitions even though it also carried forms of challenge.
The theology torn between faithfulness to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time does not know the doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts, which are explicitly appealing to the hate of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religions (and fortunately the most numerous ones) who "wrongly" read the texts and hold them only as a matter of humanism and common values to all mankind, atheists and diverse believers.
For me, fanaticism is the beastly and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
For example, some of the Qur'an's verses calling for the killing of "feachers", "infidels", "hypocrits", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable unless a few verses are read lower or lower, stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a self-defence situation.
on Yves Petit:" regarding the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous among the "savors".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to make from this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Are you not guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?
Band of Neanderthals overpaid and hypersexualized.
They have humiliated humanity enough!
What have they brought us frankly apart from being dishonoured with The Neighbours, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasman and this satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples, which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe was a New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to be of another opinion.

Almost all of the 331 dead since the ceasefire were civilians of the Donbass victims of army bombings, due to unchecked elements according to Kiev.
The hypothetically suggested presentation of responsibilities in the article without dared to explicitly designate the separatists is in the line of the world that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities in order to maintain the fable of the kind pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians

Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "this ticket is absolutely not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.

ALLOW ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
However, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperative", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which whiten the money at its own will, mainly by selling players who were well underrated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill-advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his errors to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without punishment), and therefore took three and a half years in prison.
The trial also served from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, Steaua Mihai Stoica manager, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also tries to bribe (and then hide the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to solder were our neighbors from Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I still enjoy that moment.
In the dissimulation of this attempt of corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this uneducated poor guy, idiot, cheater, and liar doesn't represent me, and never will.
The Hungarians are only a band of nationalist crooks today.
You might think that after the last time they broke the stadium armchairs and shop windows, and branded racist banners on the streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but not.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to return to Al-Ittihad.

"the absurd idea that the majority of jobseekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment centre generalise control of unemployed at the beginning of 2015?
I hope that in the wake, tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougafiers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evades, thief bosses, and other malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when you're in class: we treat the people of illiterate and toothless.
In each new period of unemployment, dozens and dozens of applications are addressed to employers, who most often do not even catch a receipt, were automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I will add that the patron name "socialist" of this government appears to me as an insult to Jaurès or Mendès France's memory.
Have we read here an article on the chained duck?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without any news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that the controls have allowed the removal of persons who, for more than half of the time, no longer have unemployment benefit.
So we wonder how we can control people we never see.
We wonder what a penalty is for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform will allow for a further renunciation, one wonders how it will help the recruitment process.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without any news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means."
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend the equal ideals of Europe?
It is not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we hunt them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain economic.
The goal is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a pacifist project.
She has no economic sense.
This is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by UEFA's corrupt mafia arbitrators.
The best solution would be for the entire East to leave this lucrative rotting organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what makes Europe enter the United Kingdom?
The Uefa should applaud them for defying the comedies of Blatter and his men.
This has been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Shooted by the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he be hoping to be retorted from small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining polemics?
In any case, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace there has been, there are and there will be people working to throw oil on fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that only that explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the overarmed Israeli identity state would have to take action against the underarmed occupying destructor of colonizer oppression.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was nothing in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavaria of its German inhabitants (who they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to ask for, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
It is obvious that Morocco is the colonialist!
But, as for Israel, we must also question history, its allies and its support to see truths.
Colonialism, whatever it may be, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
La Gaulle has been colonized by the Romans, but there is currently no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be part.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish people, hence the contentious.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism which opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need not be ignored.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colonizer-owner-appropriation of Palestine) had to dispose of Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has missed a mortant from the start.
Their stupid result will give them what the fingers bite.
He should start his rehabilitation by small baits.
I hope he didn't lose the game appetite.
We tolerate so many sotties, including racial insults and physically hard spots in football, but we have punished Suarez too hard.
I would like to see him return to England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the spots exist and yes, therefore the players will hurt themselves.
Returning his teeth to an opponent's flesh for the advantage certainly doesn't have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 games for having committed a similar act.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you murder someone at work.
What would the consequences be?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this double-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to returning to playing with his teeth.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their murky.
I almost killed the hooker.
A prerequisite for a good school career is the respect by students of their teachers and of the school institution.
This works if parents incite this respect to their children.
Parents transmit this respect more easily if they also feel respected by the teachers and the school of their children.
In the good institutions, those who are making progress in their elevations, parents are considered as partners, not as em.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together briefly) It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the task.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Putting on the parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
Action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
The operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministries) play their role and do not constantly release them.
One can dissolve a troupe that unties itself to revive it, not families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for exchange.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's first role.
Transmit knowledge.
And if parents are required, the school will train their children.
What is the minister who dares to put what was called Public Instruction in place?
Deceptive article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect a smart comment from this eastern suburbs buff?
It's a beau, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so from the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Drop it and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
Its seat is Sydney North.
Indeed a beave of the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Racing Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He passes for a grind today. :(
Yeah, but good his leader leaves him on a regular basis.
You would be rather grindful, too, if you woke up one morning and realized that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illegal benefits of life will forever be beyond your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to submit a budget and then abandoned.
At least he's not threatening to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a remote country and demand state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fear of the outcome.
And so bad for employment in France, which it has nothing to do with, it comes from legumers always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, outside especially...
It is precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or arrangement for marpol, no doubt the project would have been completed.
After all, to know if it is right or not and how BF will comply with the law, it would be nice that "the world" leans on it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton legumes.
Those who burn tax and security centers.
They want state aid.
That they don't seem normal to me at least.
Well, to the extent that an army ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to wait for an inch of the state.
Or it is condemned to allow the British to monopolize the market.
It's up to you.
The Lord French problem, who regards his maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes different people from the middle Parisian live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-term desire.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's what they'll create the Breton Flag with crews made exclusively of purebreds.
With that, it is certain that they will significantly reduce costs...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what the BBC is now expecting.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond the solo career of Hackett, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "detesting everything that relates to prog," as they just broadcast an hour and a half of a documentary about one of the largest prog groups that have ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the Genesis mind of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and claim to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to gather a bunch of demos half-finished and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait.
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't receive it.
In a curious feeling, Bank's first solo album is absolutely awesome, and quite in the spirit of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have an equally interesting story but lack the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good point.
However, I would say that the BBC "always" hated the fact that it adorates progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest shouts "prejudiced": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Song absolutely beautiful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to repeat a horrific act by another horrific act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a striking success.
There will always be a difference in size between a convicted criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misconception of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the vision and reflection of a society's most just and wisest.
That is, they have no excuses.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
We must have the common mind of the mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misheard of things.
But this is also the result of pain, hatred, and vindict in the loved ones of the innocent victim: a misconception that can never be used by those who wisely decide on the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But, to try to balance the analysis, it could be argued that the sentenced to death, often has been the victim of wild violence, which he was able to enjoy, against materially friendly people, who have paid for it free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated by the disappearance of the one who was, sometimes the torturer, loved and haunted by their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The one with the heart.
That's probably what I've been reading for a long time.
However, we would think we would read stories of another era, of old things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that are closing, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same for the other two "Excellent American Romans" cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all out of date.
I thought you stopped the white, man.
What's that all about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is infinitely better than this painful Bellow, who received him the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if you have to have an American winner, you might as well have a [lighter] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "many novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonym Joseph, on the other hand...
Who did you read?
How many books have DeLillo read the anti-DeLillo?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, more crazy, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll finish Underworld one day.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books by DeLillo to reject his literary talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's just interest.
It was a sense of humor, "the law," not a question of definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in her only interest, and not at all in the institution she represented, that we wonder what the term "conflict" comes to do with it.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Yes, the state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not warn him of the danger.
After that, we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and seek only peace.
The flood zones that become constructable from day to day when a large construction program is going to start there, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "today, there are no more floods due to the regulatory barriers."
Now you have to expand the upstream retention lakes and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the government services, of course...
Profit on the ground, on the whole of the promotion?
By field.
So 6 million euros.
Is it more obvious, here, the interest?
Get out of the calculator and you'll dream of the life that you could have had by being in place of Mrs Babin, First Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former chairman of the Urbanism Commission, the one that grants the permits to build!
The 2 mothers of the Sarkozysme triumphant are the old and the real estate.
I am left-wing and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, no low politics or down blows all azimuts, we are not in there in a battle of pious balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what shithole are you living in?
The U.S. isn't a shithole.
Yeah, the American cops are hardened because of the scratches they're dealing with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever do anything, but the cops "come and fuck them because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is necessary to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a profound ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
- Let's go!
Make the calculation.
This type of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's clear to you that it's not getting anything - many sources (U.S.) have noticed the perpetuity problem that racism is in the United States (it's not obnoxious speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which tension is rising on this subject at the moment.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street funds the NYPD in different ways, so Occupy is being treated there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the responsible people, make them talk, create confidence.
That Lhomme goes to Elysée really has nothing surprising.
Then what counts is cross-section, verification, analysis.
And here we understand that the sarkolâtres have a concern to do themselves.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of business-based antisarkozysms of all pieces (a non-place and no conviction) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates(2 referrals in corrections), two journalists friends of Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, your partisan spirit will blind you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all that is only coincidence and not teleguided !!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indignant!
From the extract I was able to read, the VA article just water the waterer.
I even laughed so rudely.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of reaching because journalists are not "strung" in secret from the sources, are they?
Unlike the fact that there seems to be no connivance between VA and power while there seems to be connivance between power and world journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be alone in waiting for an explanation of the world on the merits and its dangerous relations.
We are well faced with a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
Hence this editorial to the abos, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I would have thought that the egg would go well with the smoked herring! <*))))<<
It's just for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second-generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents came here I would have doubts about the issue of immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration program was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people entering and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperating, even refusing to give soups simply because of the woman's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she claimed that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she was NOT comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it be done, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a pub director:) So best for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more to the left, it would be communist.
According to you, what did the New Labour do, which is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to put the nose of the right in it), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-east, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-wing centre and not a communist, I said that to joke, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Release your arguments prepared as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of Gauchist politics, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour was doing that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked.
Yeah - it's more of Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK's most powerful advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of the economic migrants who come to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
He was beaten in 40 45 to fall into another discipline, that of money.
We'll make nice savings by firing those technocrats...
We should renegotiate the Treaties.
Either, let's renegotiate, and if the word "democracy" has yet another meaning in Europe, should that not be the case?
Curiously, the Commission does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
That must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to fully market the rail transport sector.
In term, this means that entire sections of the French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
It was not a good idea for me to sacrifice everything, including the promotion of a country, in the name of the liberal dox.
The EU is a real problem that we will have to deal with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to make the SNCF's accounts clear.
The French state has resigned for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential today when public resources are restricted.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the competition for TER could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If so, should he certainly not be the head of the ouveteaux?
It seems to me that you have not really succeeded in distinguishing between the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to an end with pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having a living alcoholic ex-wife so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
However, it would seem to me to start the process of separating your life from the complications you inherited.
Looks like it's what they're doing, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you are all so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones surface, have you thought about a "plan" of "fleet" so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
He looks vindicative and persists.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to give it support to help it resume work and pay food support.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex-husband.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you will support their choice whatever it is.
Tell them that he will not necessarily keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to reflect on how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you are doing this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuous father-child relationship, they will know who to thank when they grow up.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things by themselves.
To make another little effort, you are close to Godwin.
It is bent, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, the economic interests in the short term are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the pot of iron.
Moreover, with globalization the country that does in the least social, fiscal and environmental sayings immediately has a competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All that politics is looking for is growth, Growth.
There should be international coordination, but by then ...
It is not the air-conditioning that produces C02.
It is everyone who is warming up, those who are using the air, those who are taking the plane or the car, those who live in dwellings that it was necessary to build, those who are buying industrial products that it was necessary to produce and transport.
It's not the climatesceptics that showed up against ectoaxis, it's the truckers.
No policy is climatic, and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate change emits more CO2 than others.
Environmentalists also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
Political action is also needed (other energy sources, reducing dependency on the car, etc.).
And politicians act in part on the sensitivity of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when his departure es Philippines.
Terminator has only resumed the expression.
But it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is.
No one knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone blames immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the crap that took all the money.
Do we count the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the Democrat liars.
Or the Democrat crooks.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or aircraft to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.

This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Oh, my God!
Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to care for our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and cup, which allow you to warm up, to stop heating and to eat this sandwich with cheese).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not done explicitly?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in space making gallipets and roam while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
Thus, television has not invented anything, and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to inflame the world and to delight the media coverage of the Western kingdoms used to tabloid mothers.
Maybe they'll have to go back to the ground and find out we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, men or women are not sent into space to do galliettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And that, in every field.
Many things that improve our daily lives are derived from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
Can you name one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a money gouffer.
ball pen that works the point in the air (for example, to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his trades?
To participate in the manufacture of a first useless product?
Or how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the vacuum itself.
Well, that's the last high tech game.
Behind the small minority of people who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work on what this is possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to transport the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking of buying a plastic gun...
But, and those who don't think buy a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Perhaps it's the most dangerous of all.
No, because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to ignore people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would it have hurt the author/editor that to question a photo of the "sword" instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even to be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) was about?
In the absence of a typical reportage, we consider the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring Jihad text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and the terrorist groups that seek to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives were harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be mortal.
Even the small blankets given in fast restaurants can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this info, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculousness the author gives him.
It is not worth trying to make it a "ha, ha, plastic sword", the facts as you have stated support his argument.
I saw on occasion these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it's taking all its sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion.
All the wonderful innovations, often technological, give thought to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a high cost (subscription, electric consumption) that weighs on budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies results in frustration.
For example, using the Energy Solidarity Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the fillers of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the cost of the work is borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple efficient but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been so isolated this year!
Interesting to this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can make a call and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, test water-saving showers and advocate the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3), or 50 m3 of water saving per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It's not a demand crisis, it's a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (that it would have redistributed in real terms in the form of an increase in income) to pay for the increase in expenditure you are classified as "forced expenditure".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to force, increasingly decade after decade, the rate of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is to transform, energy is to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any upward pressure on energy (unfortunately referred to as energy production), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forces production up (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and the fact that one happens, or not, to make the "production" of energy expensive.
And the information published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only get worse in the coming years and decades (the IEA, in the latter reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak of conventional oil production, including low-cost oil, was reached.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it equals things.
Take that to France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As it has been noted before, it's good to win.
It's good to win.
Indeed, good work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scottish people when they just lose, there is no point in saying that they bring some color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get rid of themselves in the first round.
It's even more funny if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because now that the "golden Shige generation" withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the first XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English football player who, in my humble opinion, was really "of an international class" is David Beckham, perhaps effeminate, but I believe that if he were to thank a patate like me, he would completely crush me.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, talking about athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never kidding with the Scottishs.
I tend to be surprised to observe their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English football player who, in my humble opinion, has really been "of an international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was a very good player at his best hours.
It's about Juppe having trouble asking for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people come here to laugh at a good shot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputy's allowance...
I especially ask myself what he can tell in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How do you get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, no matter what his scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the slightest sum.
Conferences with content are mostly free of charge or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people are actually working and that the results presented in their conferences - free of charge - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the reporting of these two figures is edifying.
Researchers' lectures are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything's gonna light up for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being accused of earning money??
I'm far from being one of his fans but, let's blame him for having wrong (or fraudulently) to manage his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be quite legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remind ourselves that his movements are supported by taxpayers.
Rule #1 of epidemiology: isolate.
All US and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
He is present in Spain, the UK, Texas and other potential locations.
At what density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I'm flying to Spain, and then I'm going back to Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I see it as a clear ban on all flights and boats to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send some goods that says...
What a shame the international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but fatal health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We are all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It is a journalistic article so sad, a big title so weak.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
Such intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, the reasons and the places where we can all help to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and the gender differences that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's go, think and write, let's not just make noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not capable of providing good analysis and intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism just as barbaric, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond the understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case of course it does not give a better perspective than that of a middle activist in the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was becoming "mature" as a global resource of journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, makes that sound?
For a territorial or other elected person the money does not count.
I read constantly that the territorial civil service is increasing its workforce, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate , indeed .
There will probably be lies and truths, to us to separate the good grain from the udder.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell so many economic niches.
It's true that they never had anything to manage the people on Cambon Street.
TBs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to the investments they make.
By using concepts too vague the press as the world does the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt finances mainly operating costs...
And because the over-employment of public servants (for example, to make nice round-the-tops) leads to an increasing and incompressible burden (mandatory burden until their death, as living work and retirement work) these communities grow in investment.
It is therefore necessary to abolish the status of staff members, prior to lower staffing levels.
And also to hold mayors financially accountable.
It's fabulous, the inter-communitys would have had to be accompanied by a drop in the community workforce and it's the other way around, proof that adding one level is not effective without the other's abolition.
How do you want to manage large areas like peanuts at TGV and car times properly?
The hour of the horse that these territories were created is over, it might be time to react.
No, they would prefer to stay imprisoned, the worse in the administrative web, he would seem!
Let's try even garrotated, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Veme led with its providential men.
It really started with Petain.
Then went on to finish the series "to the end of the breath" coming strongly about.
Why won't they live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the responses of the kind "it's the fault of whites."
"responses" not "responses"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when you hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
We now agree that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved into North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of the story.
The current Minister of Defence had said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resignation!
2017:Transformation into a comfortable private gold-plated hotel for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a three-speed medicine.
We're gonna save money, and the soldiers are gonna get the little one's flu treatment elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of the patients sound like civilians from all walks of life?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They abandoned London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It's different that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the other.
In addition, outbound travel for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the bad luck of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they have access to other premises, has not done us any good.
I love supporting Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that doesn't have bad supporters and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems of the CFCC, but that must be a good gifle.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except a few Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousands of other people in the South East will probably follow them from afar or will they now have to support another team?
Call article pro-domo and good extension.
But who cares?
But then why ALL computer systems are not based on these concepts???
+because a huge mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, which counts to be the first on the segment.

But these don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few people know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has declined.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There's too much salt already in our diet.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It seems that they reason with Makes more profits, and not Makes healthier dishes and at the best value for money.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people don't have too much grass.
And then we make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in there, it'll replace the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It's not just the taste of salt, it's that it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to business kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and tasty food at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal work accident that turned wrong.
A young promiser, a thief learner, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man hid everything and brutally interrupted that vocation.
He seems to be the minimum sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
That's funny!
The desire to defuse it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to defuse it is hardly excusable.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial, the kid's father complained that he would never see his son again, but that he would not ask for forgiveness from the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who is really the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix!!!?
The kid's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the bullets lost, the accused and guilty, knew just well that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, I think it's a little bit a lot.
For having had the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
Indeed, it made noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosulle Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winemakers.
That's twice I do it, the wine, the landscape and the food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I fell too fast.
It is a pleasure to see that German wine is recognized.
However important, German winegrowers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experiment with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not that the Moselle region that should be recommended - the Franconia, the Rhenian Palatinat (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are in German style (or maybe it is the reverse, in short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after a meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their 9 favorite degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled to property are so complex, sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try the Spatlese of Schloss Vollrad with a thermal lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnston is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article about German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article about the German wines that are coming, the new Baden drys that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these debilitating Liebfraumilch that people were drinking when they were young (however, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I address myself to the more than 40 years - which, as I say, I've already seen all this).
Close the Val de Grace would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn at the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these camelries of ministries held by the barbeque, and these decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Sun Green: euthanasia at 70 years old.
Moreover, meat that will feed our poor poor assets (sic) could be sold because they can't go to the market anymore.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The missing assets will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, certainly, but to think differently than a hospital model of the 30 glorious ones.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (this is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain degree of rigorousness and discipline that we know more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we'll be damned.
First of all, we're screwed because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are being treated outside the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the supply of public service in other hospitals than maintaining a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a fault, a sign of more of the march towards the poorness of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be maintained absolutely.
"The hospitalization day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at his home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents of citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to be two-folding.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecutions and ill-treatment and war that make the people of their country flee and force them to come and seek help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by boat, then the problem that generates this traffic must be solved.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted for 26 years and tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little superstition when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and ill-treatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils with links to the LTTEs, believing that they were at risk of torture upon return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links to LTTEs be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Señor Nowak, see the ha ido el coco con tanto periodico.
In fact, this guy could't get even a chance to make it.
Didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he would not have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A few years ago, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that a large epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of returned persons was zero.
That's weirder than we're reassured, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low even very weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the more a virus is deadly quickly (generally) less likely to spread because the death of the host indicates its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After this is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is not something obscene about making media releases of certainly brave and mediocre Westerns, but to the detriment of thousands of other African sick people, of whom neither the profession nor the valour nor the virtues are known?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of announcements is a frightening bias.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative leanings would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warm-up for when the problem really gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Futures Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be only an emergency black box for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters come to see this excellent ruse for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private was offset by the Futures Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low-income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "laughing rodent" and its eventually-market fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell for the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could deter her from maintaining a buzz on it constantly..
The worst fate for an end-of-career policy: not to be recognized in the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being high enough to administer her.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We're in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
I am, of course, against the port of Burqa, but that is not the question.
What this anecdote tells us is sarcozism in the purest state: poor little ministers, confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkozy could come along with his tone on every acknowledgment of the road to show that he is well guarded by public order), the grossness and the excess carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become disobedient to carry a firearm and a badge, so that they would have every opportunity to carry out their self-proclaimed function of judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps even they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets embarrassing for him.
I want this cop who didn't know the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the moment
Don't agree, thanks to her we're laughing well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we'd have to invent it!
It's easy though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
That's it, N.
Morano was clearly in contempt, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curves and the "Yes, Madam, of course, Madam, immediately tell me, Madam, in what direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman".
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too high..."
The Americans are not bad at that, but I still think Isis will overtake them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the dead now nobody does it.
With regard to industrial civilian deaths, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I disagree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Western) between the two Iraq wars would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions to the "war machine" strike.
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to the order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and careless in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably one reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time marking their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on UN Mission GQ that they had erected five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cool blood.
So brutal and hard this bombardment, I was surprised by people's shock to know that a United Nations mission was targeted like that.
That's a good point. I forgot.
So, add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with the recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate well-known unreliable statistics.
The only figures that are even vaguely reliable about the deaths related to sanctions are those of children under the age of 5 and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to ascertain the facts.
It was, of course, in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows it.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in children under five was about 10 times higher than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths could be largely partial to this age group.
Obviously we must fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
It is necessary to stop acting as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be done with unknowns that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of French make genealogy.
It is an essential and contemptuous thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a child adopted or designed with the gift of gametes.
If you were to learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes you came out of, you could, in my opinion, rest assured because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest advances of the LDCs (e.g., Utrus Registry) are at least as questionable as a reasonably managed GPA.
The real question seems to me: does the frustration of the desire of children justify these acrobacies and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
It's just like a point.
It is obvious that we must fear the GPA, that this stupid question is
Of course, it's sad not to have a child when you want it.
It's a problem I met with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming disabled, having a serious illness, losing all their children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, it is not the most serious.
It is a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes good consumer, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a caprice where one could use the other according to his or her own will.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
