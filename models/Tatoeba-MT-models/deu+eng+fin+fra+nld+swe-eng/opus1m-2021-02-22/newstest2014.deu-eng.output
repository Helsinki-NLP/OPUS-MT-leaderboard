Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 footpath ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in the sight of the older town hall light.
Two facilities so close together: intention or tortoise?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The City Hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secures both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the ‹Grub‹ residential area.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another light had to be built to their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, the municipality of Gutach has about 12 000 vehicles per day on the B 33, of which about 10 percent are heavy goods vehicles," points out Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just going to happen here", Arnold says.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, and a circular traffic was also considered, but again rejected because of the narrow area in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when the traffic lights were chosen: "In the middle of an extra transporter loaded with particularly long wooden poles, we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without turning the traffic lights around".
The approximately 15 000 Euro expensive light system itself is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so bright that the lights of the drivers can be well recognized, for example, even when the sun is deep.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.
"If a group or people with disabilities go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will get over the road safely," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver had to think about it as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a top class vehicle ran through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the pendant of raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described by the Carinthian poet many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher brings together for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, a collage from Prosatexten.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Lebensigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crooked sofa, on which the interpretation is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
In doing so, director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance surrounds the template with a wealth of directing events, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Above all, the actresses are involved in the sometimes questionable scenarioic implementations.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads, beaten to the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they hit dangerously high poles through the production, either monologize loudly or lie completely dark on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and Winkler's aftergive of absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in every car's dashboard.
The devices that record every km of traffic and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to revise the outdated system for financing US-American roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertars have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the travelled kilometres – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax credits.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while there is no agreement in Congress on an approach, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, where drivers pay per mile drive.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by US Americans on the pole, is in favour.
In America, however, the number of dishes is not as high as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state tax on mineral oil of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices even to a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mail-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mail-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.
California's planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legal targets on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Board of Directors at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 had called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and responded to the concerns of Members of Parliament from rural areas, representing people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and large cities still move on their own to this end.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently hires 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, of which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into expanded surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the travelled kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also calm the public.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially intervene to help federal states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their aim to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of driven miles.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes, major mistakes have been made.
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay for parking fees, an insurance policy only has to be paid for miles travelled and speed data from other vehicles is collected in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic congestion.
"Auto drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials stated that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles with low fuel consumption, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Commission Director for Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats up awake
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite staff shortages with bravery.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammer had selected Feder's property on Burgberger Straße in his acceptance of the exercise.
A short circuit has been created during sawing.
Two people were injured due to the fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammer, two respiratory guards of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him out.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored lots of wood and also straw balls in it.
Furthermore, there were still electrical machines for woodworking.
The first action was carried out over the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an excess hydrant at a distance of about 100 metres.
It was now possible to design three ransom grips.
A hollow beam tube was used in the building.
Hans Kammer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to be done with little available staff.
In serious cases, support is provided through the Königsfeld day-to-day deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the completion of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the president of Landtag, Guido Wolf, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow's workers come from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, together with the executive heads of vocational schools and the district high school and the chairman of the parent council, he addressed this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who introduced the networked school project Bildungzentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, district high school and vocational school center in the forest town.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, to have the phase of caring for relatives," Wolf said.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies often maintain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region," the President of the Landtag said.
Only if there were sufficient training places, the need for skilled workers could be met.
In his opinion, the advantage of the district is its privileged location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg to develop public passenger transport.
"Keep persistent and ensure that public transport is improved," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors for coffee, cakes and after that for a Vesper.
Formerly, the older citizens were housed in the resort.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later on, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked with common melodies.
The natural stone wall, which is over 100 years old, as a front-end delimitation of the old school yard on Kirchstraße, which is located before the renovation, is to be once again placed on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was installed in the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, for the stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Further action is envisaged, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, to include the State Monument Office in the plans and to create a concept of rehabilitation for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, who will then be put on the table to the municipal council for the decision and determination of further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912 school must be renovated and placed on new sub-buildings as a follow-up in a foreseeable period.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is in need of renovation, mainly due to water and frost damage, as no drainage exists, and has an archway forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use schoolyard, which has been done by the current fixation work.
Originally, the school yard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical restoration of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken along with the State Monument.
If specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has also started.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is regarded as a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Roten state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a re-ordination of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop course will be transferred from Stuttgart University of Music to Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the US, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were thus arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar," said Laura Duffy, Attorney General of the United States Southern California, at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse, where an end to the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such a tunnel and try to use it, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 cm width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third one, a Mexican, was captured because of the seized marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum penalty for lifelong deprivation of liberty, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight of these tunnels have been discovered, it was continued at the San Diego press conference.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such tunnel construction.
Coke is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut off by now, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug gang in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to those arrested, at least one of them being Mexicans, it was called.
You have to face imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger's holiday year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250s.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year will come to an end.
Geisingen and Kirchen-hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
A document was produced in churches, where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this start-up event takes place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned, in Kirchen-hausen.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-hausen.
Church Houses will be held in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the Kirchen-hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier des Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be the last September weekend, 27th and 28th September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is also published.
"But a chronicle should not only become of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-hausen, Leipferingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present space was fulfilled with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8th with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in 764 in a document of gift, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The document was produced in churches (Hausen), which was the court seat at the time.
Both congregations are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years back.
Council takes control of track systems
Should the crossing "Am Hirschen" be thoroughly converted in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schillach must take charge of 220 000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal railway track next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles occur throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to take part in the costs with a third, the rest will be shared by the railway and the federal government.
Siltach's city builder Roland Griesshaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" crossing.
There, the city plans to build an outbuilding at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, larger vehicles, such as those carrying longwoods, could also be in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Therefore, potters suggested to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road at the given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the municipal council in controversy, as some councils questioned the need for street distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, put the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it should be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic impact for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine what costs would result from the planned widening of the road.
Despite this, the conversion of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the condition that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for encounter traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the conversion of the crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the rapidly increasing "Groltzhäuser Weg" (Groltzhäuser Weg).
The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Wegs was possible without further ado.
The study concluded that it was not to be excluded that road inclinations could lead to longer vehicles sitting on the road.
The city, in turn, is responsible for this as a road load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber drain and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, Haas argued that it was not to be agreed with the conversion of the railway crossing.
At this point, too, the risk of the train colliding with a vehicle in transition is much lower than at the other crossings, because the centre is directly adjacent to the stop at which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point as long as there was no collision.
In the majority of cases, approval was denied for the conversion of this crossing, since the city of Schillach would have to "bath out" the problem with standing vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The board considers as unproblematic the changes to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements with the train have already been made.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now need to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were for selection, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows if there are at least some of them.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or did earthlike planets go on and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are particularly raised by the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to make the research progress.
The state for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were put to the debate, five of which have now come to a close.
Numerous bodies review the proposals and search for them among the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, on which the missions of the 2007 programme "Cosmic Vision" will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to deal with this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with the 500 already known planetary systems being examined in more detail in our area.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the end, this question is also intended to clarify the conditions for the development of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (the budget is around half a billion euros).
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa is the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy worlds of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know there are still valid.
There may also be variations that might lead physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of space accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first parts of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts "E-Lisa", the best chance for an L-mission approval is a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Among them are physicists' changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on earth, he could also prove gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Suggestions have already been made for sample-return transport from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to co-operate with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and declare himself in front of the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide any answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was given to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, he writes: "Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a criminal threat, in which no defence is possible."
To say the truth is not a crime.
Snowden writes in the letter that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the US and Germany is burdened by the allegations that the NSA had belonged to Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the secret service committee, said that he should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if it is possible to 'prompt him without him and to completely ruin relations with the United States'.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele stated that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the Member.
Snowden states in his letter that he is exposed to a "serious and continuous" persecution campaign that has driven him out of his home country.
However, it was affected by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world and high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have referred to the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit for the general public.
In his letter, Snowden provides the German authorities with an offer of cooperation 'when the difficulties relating to the humanitarian situation have been solved'.
Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was to be read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier stated that if the fee is paid in advance, it would be 25 US dollars and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the flight path.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee was aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines started to charge fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore packed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments over the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less with them on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming more and more difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a luggage free of charge at the border flight path, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they would be on the air.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee will only come into force in the summer, there is not yet an exact date.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they so wish.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have so far left the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first charges for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained to Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage charge brought in 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him on the flight path if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand luggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the most smoothest I have experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see dental and hand-crafted discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding was running like lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit at the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and coffee should be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for refreshment drinks, but 7 months later it withdrew after passengers had complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontiers step to raise charges for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to the direct purchase at them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone most widely in this area.
In September, the company started to spend only half as many frequent miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again shortened to 25 percent of the flight route.
Therefore, a flight with a border over 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider only brings customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when buying directly on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and air capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Words come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last breakfast this year in the Protestant church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house were "words from the Bible" and "redevices from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, gave a talk on the biblical proverbs.
"Speakings contain wisdom of life, regulations or warnings," she explained.
They compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called sayings like, "The eye of wood is watchful, the eye of the eyes is cast out, the eye is cast out, the Lord is given to him in his sleep, and his hands are washed in innocence."
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners to speak out.
The Middle Ages discourses were accepted by the church councillor Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, a bit slanted.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges into the past".
In the end, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously outlined before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round also the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men, who already work as non-skilled workers in the industry, are to be qualified for three winters as specialists for hotels and restaurants.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with completions," said Carmen Wiechert from the labour agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had paralyzed their public site for several hours and not hackers as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail notification.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available to some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was 'in no way compromised'.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname once was No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism of its extensive surveillance program in the home and abroad after the revelations made in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the ratio was 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than in September, "but we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Office of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Feld-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft industry, in the health care and in the care of the elderly".
As a result of the seasons, jobs for staff in the hotel and restaurant industries have continued to run since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigenblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profits for Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit on Thursday following a decline in orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter, as well as problems with contracts in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
So far, only three more starts followed on the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going on as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doersksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his rating from "out-performance" to "performance" on Thursday, in view of the fact that the stock has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be the most important, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doersksen in a customer's letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical to the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But until now, binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers would like to wait for the flight test results and see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the programme was on schedule.
"The test aircraft no longer remained on the ground as expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that during the aircraft's service time, ground tests and software updates had been carried out.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period to what we have done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was called on the company side.
However, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can take in an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier stated that it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – although obviously in line with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doersksen.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on September 30, and thus remained unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have risen by just under 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order intake in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30, and was slightly higher than on December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by problems of settlement in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the secondary trade on Thursday, Bombardier's share decreased by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google's Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will move to the Board.
Brazilian Embras SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management reported on the short news service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travellers would have cried and children would have cried.
During the waiting, panic broke out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the "Los Angeles Times".
A TSA security officer suffered a shooting injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
The man reported that he himself had been taken to a security area.
The shots are supposed to have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
The number of hospital and police cars in front of a terminal was shown on television pictures.
Hundreds of people have been secured from the building.
Users published photos of a special deployment command and a rifle lying on the ground on Twitter.
As reported by the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, made up a long backlog.
Until landing, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles's LAX Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocoa-dependent lawyer who warned drug bosses of police investigation must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, continued information to subworld Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied subworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into its drug trafficking activities after it had been compromised by its own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, praised by criminals as "first-class," with the nickname "Bash", was arrested in his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed that Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of Kokain at the law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after being found in tests traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured cash for a number of house searches involving 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine as well as 200,000 pounds.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges of legal disability.
He admitted that he owned cocaine in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards had been discovered.
Ditta was later arrested, but disputed to take Kokain and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the 'secretity of power'.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken from a hair sample.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was operating an office under his private address as well as at work and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was known that he called important actors in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests, and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal prosecutor should know better than everyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his announcements were undoubtedly legitimate, as he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore called his profession into question.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out that any misconduct was self-evident and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do so immediately."
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and legal impediments, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared guilty of the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years of imprisonment for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's "German Fair".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the spectators in spring of this year, the Liederkranz will at the end of the anniversary year enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be held in Dunningen during the evening Mass in St. Martinus Church and on Sunday, October 27, at 10.15 a.m. at the church of St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe, with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair is listed in the framework of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis softens with visual confidence
The elections to the parish council in 2015 will, for example, change in the Haslach (SE) basic care unit.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change about the basic decisions of the diocese, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the New One deviates, but hesitantly, however, from a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the principal officials of the pastoral team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, Regional Dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church municipality will form a body of public law, which enters into the rights and duties of the so far six individual churches.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in which six parishes are formed local so-called community teams.
Their task in future will be to promote the ecclesial life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets in the parishes are preserved for good.
On the other hand, liabilities are transferred to the general population.
There were particular concerns about the large planned investments, whose commitment was then met by all parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested," said Bruno Prinzbach, president of the parish council.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board at the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit.
They had made themselves the task of "Becoming one, five" in 2006 and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslach Council of Churches then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be made concrete at further meetings and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
At the end, parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in relation to the SÜDKURIER, increases the additional costs of a family of four Pfullendorf families from 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surplus from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This turnover is fixed every October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These include the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can incur through a switchover over the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The energy company's supervisory board had even assumed a higher turnover in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number would be closer to the 2 cents.
Light on Permanent Red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the sign is defective.
What do you want to do then - go to Red?
If a victim has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "adequate", which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before any malfunction of the lamp can occur.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is in full debt for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of continuous red and had to take responsibility for a negligent red light failure.
The traffic light was not defective, but turned green a little later.
A ban on driving was avoided because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
Municipal council welcomes sound household
Whenever it comes to municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows the debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success.
This became apparent when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of some 7.6 million euros was higher than planned over a million euros.
The surplus in the administrative budget also exceeded the approach by around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher budget allocation," said Rothmund.
Since less investment than planned has been made in the 2012 financial year, there has also been a higher reduction in the provision of reserves.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"This kind of work is not easy to shake out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual report.
He and the council were clearly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that the citizens could soon be expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to avoid high lifting rates in the past.
In turn, however, according to Gerster, subsidies had already been cut by the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory measures.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments will take place in the coming years, for which we would like to receive subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, where he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing association.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the choir that has now been won more than happy still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and association loyalty: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues presented him with the German chorale's document as well as a engraved tint.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival took its usual course: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the full-mariners had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stallion for the honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's song association Betra also sang classic choir songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and women's group - the "impulschor" - the Liederkranz Salzstetten ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped Antos Gus with the Neapolitan folk mode "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back in his home country, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer led a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy at lunchtime.
Children's dreams are coming true
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis get mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their building and decoration desires.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day nurseries and crèches from the entire customs circle can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or decoration request for your facility, you can apply with this messenger at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forests messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many busy builders.
What about the action day and the helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press indignant about controversial media law
'We are in a distressing situation and we should ask ourselves: what does Parliament refrain from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?' was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced because it is a prolonged arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
'I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament', he said.
According to The Star, through the new law, the government takes "the media effectively into a trap." On the other hand, The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconic".
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published shots of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the charge was withdrawn after the media had called off.
According to the new law, media houses can be penalised with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court of First Instance also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single penalty has been imposed on most radio stations in bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of 'live blogosphere' in Kenya.
If they shut up the media, politicians could do whatever they want unpunished.
"No one will ever know it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a national journalist who calls Kenyan media a key control factor in public life.
"If you leave politics to yourself, they lead the country into bankruptcy and we return to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators had already been in public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their tenacious salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground was not a good thing about the importance of the city and the football club.
A more pleasant celebration had probably all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those had the lookout that came without a umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was done to the musicians who framed the festival, just like many speakers.
Therefore, Nass became FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who took part.
This is particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The poor pensioners moved 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by the deputy Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were given by Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn replaced the original lawn so that he could not be played.
15 years ago, the first reflections on the solution to the problem were the construction of a third place at the football club site or at the real school on Lake Salinen.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the construction of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, awarded a cost share of 100 000 euros for the construction of the site, and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68-by-108-metre artificial grass court began on 4 June.
During the construction phase that lasted for three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth was removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial matters.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, the contagion of Members and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no toll on a car called for by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flat rate for diversity and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of drifting out of road traffic, which is already the main cause of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would, from Pronold's point of view, be only a first step.
"There is a risk that at a later stage the compensation for Germans will be removed," he said.

Car drivers seriously injured in the event of an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempen outer ring at about 9:15 p.m.
When they wanted to turn left onto the St. Töniser street, they oversaw the approaching carriage of the 37-year-old.
The dyke collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be hospitalized for treatment.
Consistency: Locking after an accident at the circuitry
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove off town on Thursday evening, at around 8 p.m., on the left track of the two-track Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left side of the track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right track.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW passing behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
In total, about 15,000 damage to property was incurred, the police reported.
The road had to be locked during the accident, it was continued.
Vienna airport makes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
This way, there will no longer be any more at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker's breakthroughs thus falls away - the noise level should be so clearly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As the airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting-up of passenger reviews.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
Due to the absence of these messages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers a day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all the other information about changed flight climbs or departure times are a bit lost here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at Kaltenhof
In addition to braking with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are inflated in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunks, hooves and water-eiming.
Four and a half metres long, the tree trunk is 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't matter," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The trunk must be cast off vertically, should be overturned once and then just come to bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When you throw a hoove, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away is thrown on a pluck.
Ability and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the watercraft carrying more than 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a bottich are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and single match will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 o'clock.
He wishes to be a suitable dress, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But also Swabian dress is allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Sweebian Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been announced on Saturday's festival grounds.
In the evening, the music lovers come to their expense.
At 7 p.m. the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg is making the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays a fleet of polkas and fairy tales.
But their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen, who is known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the reins.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten will have an early chat, starting at 2 p.m., the Bauernkapelle Böffingen will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will then make the festival go off.
The stoppage party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Trapper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Handicraft Market and the Schaffscheren.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw castle, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein multi-purpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Furnished tofu with vegetable cream is, for example, a quark set.
The Vegetarian Federation is called World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
On 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarines are a good alternative to butter, yoghurt is replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Stuck-up vegetable cream replaces conventional cream.
Also for eggs there are herbal alternatives.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or one tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Lockers are dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people currently feed on vegan plants in Germany.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city doesn't sleep", the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the statue of freedom could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the view from the 373-metre-high observation platform of the Empire-State-Building.
Then it went through the hectic driving of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a quite ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornwinder Group of the Jagdreiters Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The windshields wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dogmen on tows musically.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed store shines with a new cafe.
One inviting you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim: to make an actual stay not only mindful, but manually re-energizing.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants at the top.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the tasty café at the Opschlag as a restaurant: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag the friendly café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," points out Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here would like to address them as well as seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Café-lover.
The friendly pair of owners is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the scenting hot brew in the various variations themselves.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For a baguette - this is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside rather - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner isn't a prolific fan of event nights: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be more the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
To name it: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the stop in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a dining mile.
For the pleasure of many clover, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and therefore also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to have come.
In the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious interaction in a sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate festival to perform honours.
The special award "Singers of the Year" was presented this time by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but also turned so many rounds for us, for our warm thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for the participation in the performances and choir rehearsals were given to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted an extra-class menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with its regular choir samples at the club venue at 7:45 p.m. on Tuesday.
"We are always very pleased with the new voice," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations is now starting to develop a number of new goals to replace the twelve-year-old Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in proposing “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs that will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come for 'thinking beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take up a process to agree on the universal sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball upper league still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that at all.
All remain fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know at all how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though Fredenbeck's third-party reserve has not yet pulled out trees, Malmon is warning the sign finger in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait for further reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Especially in the cover work and during the switching game it got huge.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely also be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos, under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique, to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the country's future, she has exchanged her business clothes against a t-shirt marked "We demand security" in Portuguese and joins on Thursday the crowd in the capital's independence seat.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White Rhodesia and later by South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country will return to a growing conflict, but the recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stocks in the north-west could lead to investments of over 50 billion US dollars in the coming years by companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadark from the USA.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional hilltop of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to put down concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regarded himself as a "loser" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted, Renamo gave up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, and to be serious," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a offensive movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation occurs when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on important North-South connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in Beira, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used for the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga, holding back, answered the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country's future and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo; they simply want peace and usable roads," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance of clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths were, however, "by far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful choice" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic" children would "switch off" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "inflexible".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
The perhaps greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented submissively, be revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling stories.
Hansjakob once again moves to Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach to live in the "Freihof" on Sunday.
The many spectators were delighted with the extremely short-term scene game.
From the arrival to the granting of honorary citizenship until his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia People.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and bridged time jumps from the youth to the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade as a great son of the city.
Stilecht led with the two-spanner and "Black Zwälder Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the sister's role and gave her tremendous life in mimics and gestures.
The Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played specially selected music between the individual music scenes and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to pay tribute to the honours of the citizens, the mayor of Haslach, Heinz Winkler, gave himself the honour, which, together with a part of the city council, made his presence in the representation of the then mayor of Hettich.
Their expectation then led the three-kings to Hansjakob's exclamation: "How beautiful, again youthful memories of my own three-kings come alive."
With their song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Heraus, Here".
His criticism of the Amtskirche had just as expressed Hansjakob at the time, as had his concerns about the effects on agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was called at the end of the scene.
There was much applause and many praiseworthy words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giant Grows
The chances of staying in the league of Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers who have dropped down in sport have increased.
Because if there was to be a wildcard procedure, then there is now a less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible follow-up position.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 has set up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city.
A first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it is not established that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets will be able to submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic suitability.
Until now, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche goes to the vantage point
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City's Cultural and Tourism Office celebrates the last of its public tours this year on Sunday, 27 October, the Abendmahlskirche.
After the visit of the Atomic Cell Museum, the Haigerlocher period after 1850 is to be seen when Haigerlocher came under Prussian rule.
The crowning conclusion is a visit to the Abendmahlskirche.
There the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomic Celler Museum.
Cards are available at the ticket office of the Atomic Cell Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US intelligence store in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, calling on unnamed circles who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmental terms, it was said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was an ally of the US, threatened Snowden there the extradition, it was continued
Long breath makes itself pay
Six men's teams fought for the winner's title at the club's tennis tournament.
At the end, Maier/Bronner's last match was the endurance.
A dream weatherer had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
Fun at the tennis game was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were the same with Michael Klippel and Saddam Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoons and coffee and cake the successful outing of the tournament took place.
At the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwalder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous side activities and events.
"Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for any age is the appropriate one.
Regional craftsmen can help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also used.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or cycles, the young guests can prove their craft skills.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as pushcar racing or stilt running.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 a.m. and 2 p.m. each.
On an area tour, the children must know which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to meet the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forests foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which drives its shabernack from 11 a.m. with the museum guests.
At the same time, Hermann Büttner is pleasant and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
In addition, the children's trade dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 am.
In addition, many craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the neighbor, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the Freilichtmuseum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand town, Burt Muro is regarded as a loving chewer because he has undertaken to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart failure, Burt is not to be removed from his dream.
With his saver, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Pipsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the halde.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies among other things on wind turbines logistics.
In black, the coal shines in the storage place in front of the dike.
Two huge blue collar and backloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Each movement of the envelopes is accompanied by a sharp warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of an unfavourable wind, this can be heard widely - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now time to keep the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will also rely on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter-deep lawn of the terminal, Capesize bulk carrier can be made here.
"This year, we want to crack the 3-million-tonne brand during the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, imported coal is going to internal power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, it would be realistic to have about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year.
The three ship loaders on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player despite the first defeat optimistically
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism among the basketball players at FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us from winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with title-defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn the piece of art into a tour 13 minutes before the end of the game before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then we have made frivolous mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful shipyards of the Munichers, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish titlet Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation was expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at Caroline's and then became more and more successful until they were known at some point to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
The festival has also grown the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who are taking part in this year's festival have become known by more unconventional means, such as on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a Sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell, focused on Rassenthemen) are products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest guest magnets is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected TV and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he was here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veterans and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last few years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that, at the end of the day, both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Cameers With Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, on Tuesday they engulfed the 11-year-olds and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working quarter.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple who had taken her should declare that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mention of an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The elder called it a rivalry in the football game, among other things.
He was admitted to a psychiatric youth institution for the time being.
Holder must be in prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, detention, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
He therefore met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will.
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats.
He retained the revenue of the women who bought it for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards he signed contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant claimed first that he suffered a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubt about the psychological restriction and hence a limited liability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court had to hear none of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, a minimum of four further cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after a first indication by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations that had been heard had been marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots all over her body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is about "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had resolved from these circles and wanted to lead a very normal life after being held," he said.
Oil price continues to reach USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report according to which China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The December reference oil varieties for deliveries had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in Europe in the late morning in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has affected prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after having reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-frisk directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Appeal Court ruled that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal by the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the detention and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case, as she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inadequately targeted at black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme of body-held cameras in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York declared its willingness to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control.
An oral hearing to appeal to the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but during the term of the party-free mayor Michael Bloomberg the number of recorded checks rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all the minorities filed an action, which developed into a collective action.
Proponents of changes to NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force and influence the way other police officers use the rules.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the police's morale, but not the crime; they would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have disappeared in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but merely reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Handn".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first president Henne reported on the work of the association in detail.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could make a picture of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, is planning to operate in an advisory function at the association.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created in the record time of almost a week the hospital in Socogim, a neighbourhood of misery on the outskirts of the capital - volunteering.
He also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when Nagold is going to put the birth clinic away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner, so Henne, for example, deacceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for that many doctors came to Germany to hospitate here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, as in March this year medical devices, medicines, dressing material, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local color by telling Mauritanian people about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It was not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson uses phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip on an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now editor of the Emergency W, is no one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them in a fresh way, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three processes to research investigative stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumours about an affair with Clarkes were first taken up by NotW's feature editor when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, it's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the search, Pawlby grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to speak to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was associated with the co-proclaimed Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks disagree to have sworn with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the pro-fussball in France have manoeuvrated into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received and heard their complaints on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will now be followed by Jean-Pierre Louvel, head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF).
The days played in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 will therefore expire.
Chains: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the civil information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, raise concerns and introduce ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been an in-depth event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häussler.
A river basin survey had been commissioned by the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many cultivated land as possible", says Häussler.
For this reason, the planning of the protection from an expected floodwater every 100 years according to the German weather service is statistically laid down.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häussler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expected to receive state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häussler pointed out that the support would only be available if an overall approach was implemented.
The community would be dependent on the participation of its citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation can be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in connection with the river Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why dams and reservoirs were no longer planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it would be necessary to combine all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
Furthermore, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Annoying people from the old town, who, even in normal storms, were repeatedly suffering from an overload of the canal network, was dissatisfied.
The problem is well known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, Häussler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be exploited.
To dimension the wastewater channels larger would swallow millions.
Severely injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could say little at first about the accident.
However, there are several statements that should be evaluated first.
It says that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revendorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles were collapsing, with the woman being so heavy that the firearm needed almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unclear.
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God Seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Stunningly the relationship in the outside: the shining eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoevski is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as a founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security delusion and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He realized early on that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator of his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minerheits-Report" dates back to 1956, and it pours the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our frightening one, mutants look into the future - and the police attack.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society; for that we have a criminal camp full of pesud criminals." They read the currents of time.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story acts like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's noise of hearing.
Anticipating the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the overseer himself will be monitored and a future crime transferred.
The system is turning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Takes errors and sacrifices not only in purchase, but builds upon them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Express latent deals about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Green Party Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician, Snowden, to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia due to government supervision
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. foreign post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage to "stress the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become a whistleblower, began publishing his full horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have led the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The overrun of the barrel brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was confused, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the eye, then corporate management will certainly also be potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey that was published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents submitted by Snowden, there was no evidence that the US passed on the secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly again ...
"This is not how it works," said Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of the US spying authorities revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-US members' plans to use an American provider were rejected by Prism's disclosures about US data mining activities.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question of customers that didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders represent the view that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage takes place.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company does not normally boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives the attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving an unattended laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Board of Directors at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked two of the countries behind China, France, Russia and Israel, which used to collect economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding ceremony succeeded, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept in place again.
This starts with wedding dresses.
White must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the clothes are often ruffled and embroidered, often with a veil, but they go down their backs and often end up in a tug.
However, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Klädermüller.
In men, the suit dominates with vests and plasmron, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
The choice of the venue was important, it was explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to start with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"Cutting is also popular for young girls", he says.
Romanticism is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion come the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, series of recordings in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For several times, the athletes of the dog friend Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley he brought it with 87 points to place twelve.
Susi Höpp presented himself with her woody class 1 to the critical views of the power judge.
Parents of a teen from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled ringermat in the gym of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat that stood behind the tribune in the school gym.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but doubted the family of the 17-year-old.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic in the law of physics, as well as against common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be protected in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in any direction.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died from the consequences of a "position-related choking".
A second autopsy, however, had given rise to another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died.
CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for handling food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school children with food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies at the teacher and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – the auto injection of EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to be able to respond to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: 'It feels like something is pressing my tongue', 'my tongue feels like a hair on it' or 'my tongue is crawling'.
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indeterminate"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with non-clear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate "undefined" or "undefined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make rapid decisions in relation to sex-allocation operations in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm staying the girl's work, which was created by doctors, maimed and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year does not come into the world as a boy or girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds for a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he said.
One could make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that makes people gay.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination against intersex and transgender workers in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or 'third sex'.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person, after a court had allowed the life-long retention of "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove gender theory from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law on the grounds that: "If the world is distorted into a new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that she found it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Participation is stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your own child," said the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were referred to as Hermaphrodiates, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
Meanwhile, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, since now it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory on the treatment of children with non-clear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be formable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued social and environmental offences – like parenting a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered himself a male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off by a mischievous circumcision to castrate the child completely and to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher says there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who were 'not happy with the result'.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but with ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were removed surgically shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should be given vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity again, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, California, is concerned that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘undefined’ to the child,” she said.
We're afraid that's what benefits intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait for it.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because "it enables adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are adults, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
She is now married to Katie 29; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an associate at the Children's Psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, however, hopes to have a child by adoption or a mother-in-law.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make overstupid decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time to write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parenting happiness.
And you don't have to make an operation that's too quick to reverse.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are taking out because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknown people injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the perpetrators probably fired with an air pressure weapon at a group of children.
That's what the police told us in Burg.
The girl had been easily injured on the left Wade.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The detectives found it on Friday.
Until now, the Police Inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to egg - throwing children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, no damage to property should have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvester Boellers were also lit in the city area, but no damage was caused here.
A resident of the Episcopal Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheeled walls were removed.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his radar shields in the immediate vicinity again, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern to be unable to cope with the many steps to the house and the apartment at an age, she explains.
Moreover: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to experience what it means to move from floor to floor with disability.
Recently a book was published by her on the topic 'Happy to live in old age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all', she starts to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with about fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who are even dealing with the topic of living in old age.
Most of them push it away as long as it goes.
Always getting old just the others,' she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will one think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living age.
'What form of residence you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can make a retirement pension in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one joins together also in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives the wish to consider resettlement.
Under their models there are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
At age everyone has his own ticks and jacks
'But for me, such a community would be nothing,' she says with a wink of eyes.
Already not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age you just need his retreat rooms', says Ries.
The author does not want to exclude the fact that a community of elderly people can still work.
But it had to be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace, she believes.
With this opinion, it is not alone in the state capital.
'Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Their service advises people around the topic of 'becoming elders'.
That is why elderly people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions just to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment should first be thoroughly informed and not appoint the first-ever-best craftsman.
Today there is also for the age-appropriate conversion specialists.
Even in the rental apartment this can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect will clarify.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment in an age-friendly way and therefore accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although a staircase can be installed inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, you'll have more gray than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of passing on unauthorized secret information.
For this reason, he had to go to the U.S. for criminal proceedings, said Jennifer Psaki, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were about the one of a parliamentarians and not about the one of a German member of the government.
Edward Snowden, a secret officer, is in principle ready to talk to German authorities.
At first, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear to the former NSA employee sought by the US in a letter not addressed by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The text of the letter is as follows, after a translation distributed by Ströbele:
To the responsible parties
I was asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously engaged in a contract or a direct position as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act on moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the disclosures to be a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken into purchase were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government still treats Dissens as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political opinion and prosecute it.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will put this down.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible information on the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden attested by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße has sold the municipality to a private person.
The sale was agreed by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget amounted to EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikvereisenbach has a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clockstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, presents the pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully master the first musician's pick.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the next book and on Thursday evening it was reported that the president's top advisors had conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope for re-election could be better seen if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's narrowest advisors – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House executive advisor David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change.
In 'double down', it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of his efforts to exchange Biden despite their 'engage, personal relationship', before he finally decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things that one should consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought, "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigation as "offensive care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train was paying for the ballots.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained on AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the potential change.
Although Dale explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "probable" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definite answer to the question whether the Obama political probes had reached the desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had no idea about whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
What happens on the way with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented when designing the Internet service like the conventional mail?
The focus of the conception of early Internet services was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not provide a stable basis for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
If "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
In the first step, the email program or the Anna browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she had a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the contents of his provider.
Will conventional e-mails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read multiple times by software robots on the way.
In the case of the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Criminal law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of emails.
This will be accompanied by possible illegal extradition measures.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading media?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not possible to recognize even without further ado who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in August 2013 according to a survey by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen recently, Google’s GMail could clearly increase.
Mother in the forest locked up and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect her pension and care money.
In order to be able to collect further pensions and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he cut the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it occurred that no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officials did this strangely, they continued to investigate.
It became apparent that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy gave no indication of a capital offence.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark-lit ice – using quails.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a brilliant treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on Quallen and could convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, thereby increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that ice cream reacts to heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have been testing it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the quail light is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says: 'I want to develop an invisible ice cream.'
This is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice crystals made up of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quail produced artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of play.
Only now, for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow comes to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally get our heads free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
He finally has his complete cadre at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Even Daverden, like us, sets pace.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a number.
But that's why we're not the favorite yet, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to play in Morsum to start a series.
There will be no Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßüß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth federalist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween-muffler.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself ready to distribute my apartment from sweets, and I do not think I will do so this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retailer's Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year are exciting inanimate objects of the last cry.
Women don't have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes anymore, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk spacemen will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
This is a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not chimping.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on this, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lychees, candies and gums.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who travel through the neighborhood with the saying "sweets or soures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not do anything – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it's haunted.
They have great names such as Terror Behind the Walls (which is in a real prison by the way), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized spectral houses in the United States that generate 500 million dollars of revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you pee in your pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the types you stand on leaves a comment like "net face expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin lamp is like adorning the Christmas tree – something we did from a small point of view.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the Pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to do the repair and not sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lambs, slowly rotting in the courtyard, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces store cooled bodies
The fire department had to leave Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night.
The rescue forces are hiding a charred body from the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces found a charred body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as one of the police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm arrived, the flames already hit from a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is not habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Hanover expects that the number of its current pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future," said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien, the state church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien returns this to the process of renunciation: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am a member of my calendar and I can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors as ministers could be very close to people.
They earned as much as teachers and could well live from it.
Certainly more is being paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a safe employer.
This is what the young people are facing today, which is not just about career, but about a mindful work.
According to the State Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, some 60 pastors retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In the future, in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy positions.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad range of training.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belt as well as a freephone system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the tights and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called firearm to rescue a little dog who stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her poor location
Firefighters roped on a rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to secure a little dog that was stuck in a rock wall on a 15-metre-high edge.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she escaped from the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the striped Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hastened to the position and hastened to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dogcakes.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, technical rescue specialist, said: "Ruby had a great fortune."
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was sent to the vet for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had grown too large and collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters did great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate dinner with the old rocker at night, and that "he drugged me when I was 18."
She added: 'This has been a long time and he was very nice to me.'
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he "dismissed categoricalally that he had ever attempted rapprochement at Katy Perry".
The representative added: 'Perhaps she has confused him with someone else'.
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" ended up in first place this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured by barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role – as expected – in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often follow their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in so many years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" entry at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange London's yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to win nearly five million votes for Germany – only founded this year – in the Bundestag elections in September, and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by the attachment to the single currency, many people feel that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current state and currency problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives, which were adopted by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris up with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe's own economic policy, which has to fight against the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU front national has just won a decisive re-election and thus the ruling socialists pointed to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU's choices next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections cut well – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too long term, the growing opposition to the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather will become something like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whatever it is to say, Berlin and Brussels, what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalising Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breasts and shams at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is entering quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Clearly signs of development, such as growing breasts, shams and shoulder hair as well as body odour, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift at the age of menarchs (the appearance of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Frühe puberty for girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually constitutes the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that can be closely monitored by a paediatrician.
In case of rapid progress, tests may be indicated by an endichronologist in order to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to ultimate growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medicines, but he admits: "Repressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers."
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter was given ten days.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She got scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are cause.
Boys come to puberty similar to girls.
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the ages of six and nine, which creates a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow their facial and sham hair before, the trend towards a full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is widespread even among babies and young children.
"We need to be careful about how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their paediatrician how to speak with their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, indicating the tone of a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width that passengers are offered on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones to which airlines strive most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims made on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but American archeval Boeing says that airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are struggling to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft has been designed – in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the indicated economic results to deliver the new Mini-Jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized '777X' makes 406 people at seats in the tourist class which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hiebe about technical details through advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing to the public in front of Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed financiers a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props," says John Leahy, Airbus Sales Manager.
People are getting thicker in the face of changed eating habits, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the average male American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100,8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says his rival stopped at a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that showed that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus to the seating dimensions and says that it is not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and facilities.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," says aircraft cabin expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
The challenge is to race aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeing statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machines with 10 seats per row currently used.
"Boeing therefore cuts more seats on his plane to make it more competitive on our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight rates.
"One hundred inches of seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The worldwide Jet vendors even carry belt dimensions to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-compressed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat series, but according to its own statement, it has not yet sold any.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more customizability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be puked, but could be distracted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the smoking pleasure the garage
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine infection for a lifetime.
More experiments are needed before human testing, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market, but experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "out of time," the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is quite sure that children will be given before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
"Then they know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure with the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to get used to it," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
An investigation of the former Minister of Labor Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is initiated by the government's corruption control.
The former NSW Minister contends that at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, he had changed the rules for the lease of Maritim, which had hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations to the question of whether Obeid has influenced various government ministers to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared accordingly on Thursday.
In many years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had urged public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids with $2.5 million each year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of the Port from February 2006 to November 2009, originally voted in favour of public tenders.
However, he disagreed that the changes had been made at Obeid's request, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government's lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority, between August and September 2007.
"Where is the issue of the development of commercial lease arrangements discussed in these telephone talks?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whialy Tripodi.
'No' replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night confirmed a leading government employee against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already aired rocket supplies to Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457-visa could be subjected to the "realty test"
The Government is considering an "intellectuality test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa within the framework of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, a criterion would be used to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting the Australian neighbours.
“Sound statements like ‘foreigners should sit back’ and ‘for Australians first’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region sew an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was waiting for talks yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considering.
If the 'criterion of authenticity' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally linked'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after hundreds of companies that first wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumer probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
Since his father's death, the man's nine-year-old son, who had come to Australia with him, has been taken care of by an adult cousin who was also on the boat on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 Railway Project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections be established between Scotland and the north of England already at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring the UK closer together'.
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government corrected the estimated cost of construction of the high-speed road between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is a truly national network of routes bringing the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for 'unmistakably' a commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail links throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, create the benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and taking joint action on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian flight passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the United States to ease the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, view or play videos on their aircraft during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which U.S. airlines have to do a lot of work, but do not follow immediate plans to change their regulations.
The Agency also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia continue to apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft," was announced.
The topic is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at any time and that passengers comply with safety instructions issued by cabin crew.
Virgin has already talked to CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that it is open to change, but it would have to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that the current regulations will remain the same.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices cannot be used at take-off and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change this," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that allow passengers to benefit from, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it in detail.
The decision varies with American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will point the passengers while landing the equipment.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters had provided light missiles for ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost spectra of acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the beginning of the Bundesligaspiel between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests with their songs were heard.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the faithfulest of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are standing, was initially exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle calls.
The pod of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint firing, remained intact.
And all the way to the front of the rostrum, there was a big flag with the inscription "District Stadium Prohibition".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player entered the place, did short-term cheer start.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and worrisome scarfs - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing rained.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby win, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a mood for celebration.
Only five minutes before the call, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which until then could be reached with hands, came out in a loud scream when Dickel asked as usual the mood on the edges in the stadium.
Last of all, as always, the South Tribune was on the line - and finally, here again, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derbywinner is on" came with a message from the South Tribune, everything was as always again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierby at FC Schalke 04, some of the popular BVB trailers had fired light missiles into the audience and into the square - and almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller hit.
The game was shot late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-motion," the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up zero-tolerance policy in the field of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - by Tuesday these now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty until the end of next week.
"This is going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
One may be excited about how the reactions on the South Tribune will occur.
Pfandhäuser boom in Singapore as the crisis in the middle class has arrived
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in a storehouse in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," Amirthalinga says.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee and worked with her husband, she does not provide enough income for her family, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it exchanged, this week became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or income statements, which is why loans are faster than bank loans.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a relaxed fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle income look for deposit houses to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, was a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Nationals are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the last two years have further strengthened the trend towards the pledge of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandma's chain of gold and get back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, not only wants to expand to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders had come into the crucifixion because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that deposit houses not only fine more favourable interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already have and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household education," she explains.
The mortgage loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing by society.
Also, not all people who use mortgage loans are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come to the ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service explorer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-brightening NSA webshops.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Parliament, during his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the ex-secretary staff at a German public prosecutor's office or in front of a committee of inquiry would state.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Lifesaving Package Over 325 Million Australian Dollars for Tasmanian Health Care
The Australian government is committed to the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth will take "all-out measures" to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population in the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has set up an emergency rescue package that, in our opinion, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and grey star treatments, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that hospital workers affected me have expressed that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister was a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if 'they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course'.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the care list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the public health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement to be just a 'plastic solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth in 300 million and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The story played in France in the 1760s tells the striking story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
As she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superintendent and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in lust for lust or sensation – and there lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it also for the audience a tormenting shirt.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Global Monitoring Group on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while heavy clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the civil war began.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, set up by Damascus, an organisation based in The Hague, to destroy or make "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals with toxic gas and for filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts say that there was a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in the UK.
The group of activists, who are following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting highlights the danger to chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a war on the citizen.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
That is why "no further inspection activities are planned at present."
At the beginning of the week the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and had visited 21 of the 23 sites specified by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, visiting two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday OPWC stated that the two sites had been abandoned according to the Syrian statement ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other named facilities inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the attention to the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
In this civil war, the Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, for three years now, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
wrath on the judgement of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 were angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators who were tried, because Umar Patek was to be shot legally.
Patek, who was on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for almost ten years, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
With suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A claim was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, is also called "Demolition Man".
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corten, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction executed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I'm not going to have another grandchild and I'm never going to see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made the same as the ground when a huge bomb exploded shortly after 23 o'clock on 12 October 2002 in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into the coma and died three times, while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell, Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let Him live – no, there is no reason to let Him live.
20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds, there's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber in court.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't set himself up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no regret for the suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was passed before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with memorials in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not call mobile phones)
Flight passengers can now from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and using the reputation of movies, not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage arrangements in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
At present, passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them again until the aircraft reaches an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
Upon entering the landing, the passengers must switch off again and not start again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even on take-off, landing and roll-out, the FAA stated.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to higher altitudes for use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendant association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like a watchman on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloading of data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still not a Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in a public way because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the airpath.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stored, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may impose a ban on certain electronic equipment when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Experts on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers, after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment by passengers had become known UKW radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude has been reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only emit minimal radiation when flipping.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of facilitating restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011 company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of childless e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the device interference was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots saying that aircraft systems are disrupted by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the switching off of the devices by passengers when landing instruments under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service from North Sea drill island saved bird
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released into nature again.
Last month, the water ramp was flown with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: "This water ramp was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: 'He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.'
When they were released, the waterrail was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain who care for prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing, for example, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the states are stagnating in the EU.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be promoted by the government rather than the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be restored to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as, according to companies, the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the traditionally most European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This knowledge of companies of all sizes and leading companies shows that the economy is pushing for a "sound change" that will bring the economy back to Britain.
This is a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a referendum in favour of staying in the EU at 16%.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a marked shift in power from a renegotiation to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary since the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the results of our survey show, which means that companies have a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, started," said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard officially.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route towards the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location Germany.
The economic framework data are consistent and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock market newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the stock market newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, how sought were German commercial real estate, show the view on the transaction volume.
In the first three quarters of this year, it grew by 31% compared to the previous year's quarter.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord of sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences related to children before charges against child caretaker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were filed in 2011, as reported by the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had 'never been involved in an incident of sexual abuse in the organisation'.
Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another, in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said that Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that 'there had been external YMCA checks in which the YMCA was recognised as the front line in the field of child safety'.
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed 'from me to the bottom' when Lord was hired and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord had been convicted at the beginning of the year of sexual assault on twelve boys during his two years of activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare disagreed that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees had refrained from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord alone was with children, she cared privately as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords in YMCA Caringbah, was "very frightening and most of the time very imperceptible".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements made by employees that they would not have dared to refund their superior report.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with the Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Interval" was "not about reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations had occurred was made by the YMCA Children's Service Manager Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that what had been "overly" and poorly implemented.
YMCA NSW had not been a child-proof organization since Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, checking, hiring, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair stated that he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East.
To the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by Evening Standard from London: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in a crowd in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was ahead.
But none of them were prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee loosely trot through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their performance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put his plate cap in a crooked angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the pony that lie far above his age.
And Toffee received top grades for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift last March for his third birthday and since then has practiced every day with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great span."
They had to fight the entire field and left the square with goldpocal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfectly strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired him and knocked him up."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As it started, it won't be long until it's on the 'Pferd of the Year' show – and I'm sure it's going to be a good cut.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the performance ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped her part, which really fit perfectly on the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after calling
A Chinese newspaper, which had called on the front page to release a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a state company.
Now the New Express is subject to a 'comprehensive rectification', the regulator explained.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license.
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized I was acting wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and stated that it had failed to properly review the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite an amendment to the law at the beginning of the year that prohibited the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 - by 90 - centimeter tunnel as one of the finest passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognised, the authorities explained.
The discovery of the tunnel had ensured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are at risk of being sentenced to imprisonment for ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, though, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has said himself to separate his wife, Top Model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't run exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as the parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs considerably from it.
While vegetarians allow for the consumption of creams, ice cream or a powerful edam, these leprechauns are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves away from all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains to be wondered, but with closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable inventiveness.
"Breedings are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who provides a variety of special products for Vegan.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
By the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became Vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that there are other everyday issues without animal products.
In the first place, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of the vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, brewers or rubber bears, the Vegan quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "it's actually not a renunciation, it's not an ashtray, it's an enrichment." The assumption that the dietary shift reduces the choice of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And it was these conditionings that caused some attempts to fail, which were still so well-intentioned.
"The search factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn to it: "Some flavors are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," the Vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste tenderly.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are good, I get checked out a lot," Proctor says.
Especially from the lack of vitamin B12 many veganism critics warn.
"As animals are fed, instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 portion is high," says Proctor.
For Vegan, there is also the possibility to take the co-enzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor should not go a long way for the food supply.
In the end there are basic foods everywhere and each supermarket has soya milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I buy something special every now and then.
"Many people ignore the fact that only finished products are expensive, but so do "common" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes was far more favourable and less time consuming than it was generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small cuts you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake Proctor was also able to surprise his parents-in-laws.
Family parties give the Vegan a new spice.
This has dynamism, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also confronted with scepticism.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Will I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - In such questions you have to act as a vegan with a feeling of touch.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to eat an enclave.
And, more precisely, the daily world does not appear as vegan as suspected - and the Vegan does not seem as restricted as it is commonly accepted in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
Apples are everywhere!
"Many donors offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
"When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander said, "you have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the Kombuse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
In fact, vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the vast majority of things impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as dyeers, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Vegansissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are used as food and detergents.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stay standing or to stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral index that strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not quite manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on the Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unimpeded.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures on the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the indices of the Nasdaq not been calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year alone there had been two failures in one week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a lot of bad orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the USA came to a halt due to a computer panel on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, Facebook's stock exchange programme had provided for a great deal of attention last year.
Nasdaq's systems had not grown in the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established SEC's stock market supervision and donated the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constancy: Wheeler drives 63-year-olds around
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at around 10 p.m., was on the left-hand walk from the train station to the marketplace.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped on the walkway from a local, the cyclist could not stop in time according to the police.
During the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and attracted a space wound of about 15 cm in length to the head.
A rescue vehicle team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police to issue an extradition order to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard stated that he had been "requested to stand up" to the 40-year-old Australian, who called on him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply with it, he was threatened by arrest.
Assange is threatened by extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual delicature after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "invited a 40-year-old man to sit at a police station at one of our chosen times," one speaker said.
He still violates the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver with a hot drink and 210 km/h between his legs will be fined £1,000
A penalty of £1,000 was imposed on a driver because he had been driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie confessed guilt without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay 90 £ and a £100 sacrifice.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasure Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on dwellings costing over two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers who consider apartments as companies and not individuals.
Already now, revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, exceed the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: 'After the increase in stamping tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the associated legislation against bypassing it, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete local tax system.'
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant as to whether to buy real estate in London or to sell ownership of it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the wealthy London southwest belt, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, have been costing its record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "internal market" in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's tail protrude with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail turned to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "With people well known that the left and right brain halves react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side of their connoisseurs' tail, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrants and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in the one direction, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (looking from the perspective of the crying dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tailings were mainly left (again from the dog's perspective, which welds), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and you have to wean with the tail in a direction rather friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol, stated that this had not been the first study to investigate whether dogs were important to the left and right.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: “Dogs tend to go to a robot dog if their “tail” welds to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, therefore, the differences could stir up that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
Since her behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail moves in the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer has suffered from throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the Hydro on Friday.

The announcement of the band came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening as well as on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"At Alex Turner, an inflammation of the throat was diagnosed, so unfortunately he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th, which in the Hydro in Glasgow was moved to November 21st.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
Pope Francis will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope's election – this is true of a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory, was held.
"The Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world, can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of elected cardinals is again 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year was therefore important because it was the first time since Francis was elected in March this year, says Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on Europe's side, and in particular on Italy's side.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of the Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was "well possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been able to do this – that is all completely new.
Valero said that, typically, the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we do not know who he is appointing”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors recalls just under 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks, built in 2014, to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a notification from the US Vehicle Safety Authority on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seatrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"When driving from the rear to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA).
The models called back were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of a Obama selector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that had been spoiled by the Republican blockade.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terriblely sad book.
It's a book I thought I'd be blazing during the sad second year of my medical school and giving me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the Memoirs Barack Obama as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient credentials in the evening and go to bed, then the book takes me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and take a breath from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and newspeakers stopped to highlight the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At the time of Obama's move to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if one is torn from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced secrecy of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that party-political block tactics have cut too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up trying to explain myself.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state should be allowed to stop or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished for exposing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which says that the White House's efforts to calm down the media have been the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict their previous political campaigns.
It is obvious that the name of the Member is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I once again elected Obama in 2012 not because I was excited about his candidacy.
With Romney, a confusing and unfailing alternative, he seemed unable to define his directions and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hope of which we had heard for so long.
But with the fall in Obama's approval values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become much harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton during the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I can't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters were pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining warehouse, which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, filed the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are removed or shortened.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared 53 votes in favour after the new election as the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast session.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to allow it to go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where we enter, enter data into a computer, immediately select and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot boxes.
Is it used because you can then erase the results if you don't like them?
It is incredible to vote with pencils these days.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
In a public office, it is a service to the public.
"We are striving for no reward but history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two persons familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation on the alleged manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 billion dollars a day change owners.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal is all about the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, related persons indicated that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now expected to have been granted leave from his current position as European head of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was leaved this week and Matt Gardiner, former currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The instant message group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation of people close to them.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that she was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that banks are supposed to have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks come through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset traders in an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units in investment banks, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks led “to the market being affected by very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day, when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a dealer of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after having caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank informed the competent authorities promptly and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is limited," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has decorated the building fence on the Bechtle-Grundück at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, it is said in a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the property is threatened to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had announced the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI's action, a transparent message "We are here" had been put in place.
However, the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative did little to interfere with their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In a conversation with many passersby before the "site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be much better, although not very few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it is called from the BI.
As we heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid that the population would vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
For this reason, some appear to be too scared, others feel they are "stupid blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Ranknick shields for Schiris: Do not use a Schwalbenkönig
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also disappointed, so the sports director of the "Bullen" showed himself disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he protected the two offensive vertebrates at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegal became an alleged actress - which, of course, was no one, as the TV images showed.
"A thorny misdecision," said Rangnick, who called the referee Harkam "over-extended."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He made a determination to defend his German compatriot: "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
In the face of the success, however, Rangnick agreed on a praise hymn.
"There are only two words for this: Very well," he said.
There's not much to put aside.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
Framework changes in the winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Outside a player comes up with the wish that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the US Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it obliges U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the tax authority of the state.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts came to the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also expressed the view that the provision of the Health Act, according to which states would either have to extend the access conditions for Medicaid or would otherwise have to abolish all state funding for Medicaid, would not be unconstitutional.
The appeal against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dark valley.
Because of the low sunfall, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swam at the launch ceremony at the TV2 station.
Some of the valley dwellers stood up with sunchairs, while others sat on sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-hunting people had to ride a cable car on a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (around EUR 615 000) project.
A similar construction has given winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post barely emptys Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red dots for Sunday emptiness are still on various letterboxes of the city centre and the city districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptiness on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP says.
A request from the FDP had confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be empty.
Whether the FDP will also be emptyed on Sundays in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The social and youth-political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to pick up here.
The Sunday apprenticeship is an important postal service at Terminpost.
"This undertaking is radically and irreproachably thining out despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberal Group and city council, supports his colleagues in the group: "What annoyes me is the fact that here, secretly, the vacuum times are changed or also deleted".
The post office is close to the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be cleared again on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also needed for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letterbox with Sunday education on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has declared itself to be in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurter Park Charges to Increase Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the City Council advises on a presentation by Stefan Majer (Green) of the traffic detour.
As a result, the parking fee should be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking clocks and ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council must decide.
The retail committee at IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking right in front of the shop was "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and indeed long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The Älblers were on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they were not able to keep up with the rapid actions of the joyous cities, even by age.
With the hard and placed shocks, the Gönninger did very hard.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly across the centre of the net and were not present at the block defence.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joyous cities in all respects.
In view of this pressing and play-deciding performance, the third sentence was won slightly lazily and hopelessly at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make itself clear in Nagold, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were confronted.
They delivered a hard-hitted two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in ball acceptance; even in passports the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical play scenes the overeat prevented the view for possible point gains.
However, in this highly balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was in agreement with the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Day care at the small English cottage
For the now fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project of the upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach.
Because of suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be cut free on that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the splendor of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect could also be taken into account ecologically.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Department of Nature Conservation of the Fraud Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome of the country council of Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers itself with the aim of maintaining the now strongly grown old Almendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free compounds to maintain your species.
Tribukait said she would not fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the achieved for the future with the Life project as well as the previous days of care.
After these various presentations, Vice Director Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tug is ready to call if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone belt.
The goal was the open view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own city works, has not yet become a second mayor's candidate.
As the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for office for age reasons, the 46-year-old bank merchant and farmer Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been established.
The application deadline is 6 p.m. on Monday 11 November.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, sued on Thursday a avalanche of patent infringement claims against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversold by him at Nortel's insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patent for $4.5 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of patent infringement in front of the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents relate to technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint, which thus reaches the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being overbooked at Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed to purchase the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," the letter of appeal states.
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt commits first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi is laying off the official page, but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn in, and so came the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black robed judges of the court, who has his seat on the Nile and is cepted after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its establishment 84 years ago, had been seen as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidious pomp from the Mubarak era, traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharistic "replacement wheel" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to reach the goal of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
'Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,' explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wood-plated chamber in which he laid the seat.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his opening speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in esteem.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of visitors to the university's largest audience with choirs of "The Army and the People are One Hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and he promised to demand back presidencies from the military council of the head of state who had been driven out of office.
But with the laying of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg disco "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by ladder: heavily injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder when changing a defective external feeler and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he climbed the ladder leaning on the roof, he slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg.
Rapists in South Africa: Two Lifelong Detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and maiming of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender was sentenced to twice his life on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the severe injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the crime week.
The act had triggered national horror.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours to survive the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar at the night of the crime.
He also confessed that he had beaten her and raped her, but he disputed to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially left several perpetrators, but two suspects were released from custody because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor's office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64,000 ads every year about 64,000 for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has much more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the dark figure in the case of sexual violence between 10 and 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for ham is the pig balls, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Deutschlands liebst Schinken", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Schinken.
Only with hair protection and kitel he comes into the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo seen for reinforcement in fast food in Waldshut
"I'm being worked out here in raging quantities," the TV makers, Schwarzwalder Schinken, marvel at me as a mass product.
16,000 students speak for themselves a week.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters with quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The audience sees that the cutting of the balls continues to be manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
The smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boat".
The trick: pine branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham here in smoke.
After all, 20 days in smoke make ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concluded.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290,4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well in the direction of record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically one of our strongest winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which offsets a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similar things went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while here the business customers also spend less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit is expected for the whole year for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's shares rose yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are focused on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the future, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 on.
The test also includes "unseen texts" to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students must take an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other key issues will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "requireable, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and Singapore students receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – is likely to encourage schools to set up more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is paid to 'real life problems', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious pies attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes will present the circuit performance show this weekend in the Burgerhaus.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
Again, the local association W514 organises this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wicked hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize-winners presented the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
Mayor Hermann Arndt will open the exhibition at 2.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. on Sunday, where the award ceremony joins.
Guests are also invited to a large Tombola and a delicious cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates herself from her legendary blonde curls and appears for the first time with a new Bubikopf.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, at the Neue Museum des Schlosses, will focus on the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations of Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
In the forum of the question, Johanna Rahner wants to examine how today people are classifying the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, placing it on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas", then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
They have "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the trouble of death".
This is linked to the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their confession of faith at the firm
In two services 101 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were made.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous members of the congregation, the company had prepared for the big holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of the Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: 2nd mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel tells of the organizing sports association Illmensee.
Among the participants were, in particular on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous Edermannsradlers who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two top German junior riders were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were expected to drop out of the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to place himself in second place again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare, which made it top of the winning stairs.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen came in second and third place.
A positive development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race this year were even more absolute topathlets at the start.
Four riders were able to set off from the top regional riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half pro from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was twice the world champion in a 12-hour ride together with a teammate.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
In addition, Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German champion titles in the Duathlon, has his own title.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, the finish was a lash finale in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only one second behind it the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as third parties in the overall ranking.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the 'CNN Hero of the Year'.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and there caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is 413 for a doctor.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonans could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots had Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and ride on the roof with the garnished medical equipment over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning the team will then start to investigate hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crucibles, gifted glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local numbness.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the surgery the patients get up and go into the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting penis, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free operations last year and knows that it is making a huge difference with its work to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a broken leash that he received now enables him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering in Bwelle's group.
He is always in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we help to clot blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon and often bring donated medical supplies.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," O'Malley says.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost continuous work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he made to his Father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Amazing mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is Horst Janson cut to the body.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, the acting art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So the two simply complement themselves great.
It is almost meant to be able to see the wrinkles in the back of the old man, of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of living on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masteres excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is on stage as a single actor in a wide range.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not a boring moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists of only blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to operate in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which with her songs and her magnificent voice means the feeling of life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 meters below Cologne, a waste water canal from the Roman times is obtained.
If you visit Cologne, don't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, realize that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne-Tourism is a meeting point for its guided tours directly on the cathedral.
The tour starts completely unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the remains of the old city walls remained only that which was not too large.
For this reason, most of the users of the parking lot are also rushing past the Roman remains today and just drop off their car.
But anyone who looks more closely discovers in the Parkdeck D2 an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight again, Schulze let the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the Prestoire, and here the participants rise back to the depths.
We experience here the seat of the former most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "city of Roman right and city of Agrippinenes, founded under Emperor Claudia in the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the prestory is the former palace of the governor, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exposition of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima quietly if you want," says Schulze.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After getting the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the town hall square for which the construction work will begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass until completion.
Leg almost hacked: repositioning of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up after over four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds started in front of the Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent about the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then heard of the bandidos.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, is planning to have beaten and stabbed three men in one car.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have heard of the competing group Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that there was a persecution hunt with several cars in the past.
According to the charges, it was about revior struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been released in a first trial in early 2012.
A judge said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another crime.
The opening was mainly about the reconstruction of the procedures in the night of the event.
As a witness, the Commissioner in charge was invited at that time.
In the center were phone calls by the defendants and other persons who had been arrested by the police.
Difficult is that rockers almost always stick to a law for them - and don't say anything.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims was unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said, on request, that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven further negotiating days are scheduled for the process.
The rejection company doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bays of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, hunger makes itself felt.
Of course, the one or other cocktail or wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to enjoy a small thing?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it comes to fast-food-holes at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then not like going home and going to bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers become apparent.
Because what needs to be missed is that with constant regularity you throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially during the weekends, thrown away paper bags are on street edges and on parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash?
It's not just that the paperware is wasting the landscape.
Tütten have already covered transport facilities such as guide boards and caused accidents.
"Wegwerfgesellschaft" didn't think about this, but probably she doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know what a back bench can look like after a crowded night: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be a few bags more or less no matter - unlike the road where no one wants to trip on the food remains of others.
I already see the day when cities and communities are getting too dirty to get out of the way - and the fast-food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama’s Retractor in Health Policy
According to harsh criticism, yesterday President Obama made a withdrawal from his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received a notice from their insurer, the Republicans warned the president in the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama related his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government described it as a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed insurance themselves would have to look after another tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to tell these Americans quite directly: they have earned better," Zebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform had been "missible" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement of a raised Zebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a discussion with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Zebelius repeatedly urged the question as to why the "architektin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from state-funded insurance, in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which he now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN the American news station that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
According to CNN, the aim had been "missiles and related equipment" of which the Israeli government had feared that they had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab Al-Arabiya channel had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired on Thursday night from Wednesday, and the Israelis had been held responsible for this.
The Israeli TV channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Newa-type defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles that, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can carry explosives heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The Jerusalem government has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency cites an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel had carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: "We are not commenting on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant that it would cross a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that the US spying had gone "unreasonably too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, pointed to a departure from the US’s defensive attitude to its surveillance programmes by saying that in some cases espionage had gone “unreasonably too far”.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden on NSA espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has come into a diplomatic storm of disarmament by its allies.
In a speech delivered via video links at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: 'The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have almost passed by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was to go back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September.'
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to provide clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that its monitoring processes saved many lives.
He added: 'We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.'
There is a radical extremism in the world that is intent on killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashs, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to disperse concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in counter-terrorism efforts, as the Chair of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats that, due to the frustration over the National Security Agency's surveillance, he would no longer participate in anti-terrorism organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States to keep Europeans on board, in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democratic Senate member to chair the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their trouble with the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although this week's head of intelligence said the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden’s shared documents, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
James Clapper, head of the national secret services, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all this tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to be held this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some 'serious words'.
He said that European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect European rights, they must also be based on the fact that we are not the only ones spying on," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the horror of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller at the FSV Mainz 05’s Bundesliga-Ausrücksspiel at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is using Nicolai Müller.
He'll try to train with the team tomorrow.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his appointment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalie with six hits.
For the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured servicers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian calls for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for having made a false speech after she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning hours on Sunday June 10, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to figure out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the edge of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"Of course, we are very concerned, but we hope that it will be back at home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford filed an appeal against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht free of charge.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is vacationing in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court, it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve his stunned tourist image, and that is why it comes to acquittal.
